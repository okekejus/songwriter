# Songwriter 
My first main attempt at working with Deep Learning models, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks. Will be attempting both GRUs and LSTM. 


- Took inspiration from lyric analysis
- modified extraction code, added progress bar, fixed up logic, exported as text insted (took a total of 21 minutes)
- Clean text up
- figure out how to train model using both structured lyrics + vocab from other places so it is not just limited to the songs.
