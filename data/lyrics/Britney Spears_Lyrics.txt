Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small

And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear

What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me

I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry

Ooh

This is a story about a girl named Lucky

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for

They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?

They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

"Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"
"Oh my God, here she comes!"

Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?
And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking

But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none

This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight

By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest

Do what we like, get what we want (Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty

Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia around to L.A.​​​​​​
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Set your watch, they're so predictable

The girls roll up (Windows roll down)
Eyes on us (Jaws on the ground)

See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (Ooh) would make you lose your mind

What's up, Britney? (Uh-huh)

But they don't understand me
I really don't know the deal about my sister
Tryin' hard to make it right
Not long ago, before I won this fight

Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative (That's my prerogative)

It's my prerogative
It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)
You can’t tell me what to do

Don't get me wrong, I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships really gets me down
I see nothing wrong spreadin' myself around

Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative (That's my prerogative)
Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative (That's my prerogative)

It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)
You can’t tell me what to do

Why can't I live my life
Without all of the things that people say?
Oh, oh

(Oh!) Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative

(They say I'm crazy)
Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)

Dark mascara dripping down my face
Only fools could ever feel this way
Send my message into outer space
Wonder if it's gonna float your way

I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear out my mind
But it's difficult, so difficult

Houston, I know there's a problem here
Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Baby, I wanna be closer to love

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon

Last night I was in your arms so strong (It felt so good)
One small step and, baby, you were gone
Now there's meaning in the saddest songs (I just wanna cry)
All I do is cry and sing along (And cry, and cry...)

Drinking alone in my party dress
Would you come back if I looked my best?
Put on a smile and I say to myself (I said it again)

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
Moon
Moon

I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear up my mind
But it's difficult (Why is it so difficult?) so difficult
Château Mariott
Il m'amène au lieu du chevalier cet hivers
Cinq, quatre, trois, deux, un

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon

Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh, I hate myself and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale
Current girlfriend, ex girlfriend
I'm trying to be cool
I'm being paranoid, am I seeing things?
Am I just insecure?

I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume

I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Please, don't forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history
But I'm your girlfriend, now, I'm your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
That I'm just insecure

I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory
So I, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume

And I've been thinking 'bout how you say my name
You got my body spinning like a hurricane

Turn the lights down low if you wanna
Just wanna move you, but you froze up

Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close

And I don't wanna be so damn protected

There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

I'll tell 'em what I like, what I want, and what I don't
But every time I do, I stand corrected
Things that I've been told, I can't believe what I hear about the world
I realize I'm overprotected

There must be another way

What I, what, what, what I'm gonna (I need) do about my destiny

I'm so fed up with people telling me to be someone else but me (Action!)

What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)

Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark in-between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

If I said I want your body, would you hold it against me?

Don't wanna wait, I want it now (Na-na-na-now)

And you don't have to hold my hand when I'm hurting
Won't make you sober me up when I'm turning
And you don't gotta say it, I know that I'm worthy

You could ask me for a sorry
And a calm before the storm
Ask for pieces of my body
Until all of it was yours

But I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just love me, just love me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just love me, just love me
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just love me, just love me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just love me, just love me, just love me

If you think that I'm saying it because I'm high maintenance
Like I'm trying to mask every problem that I'm facing
Well you're wrong cause I don't need nobody when I'm breaking
All I need is your luv and a little bit of patience

You could ask me for a sorry
And a calm before the storm

You don't have to look like a movie star
Ooh, I think you're good just the way you are
Tell me, if you could, would you up and run away with me?
You don't have to roll like a millionaire
Baby, I would go with you anywhere
We don't need no gold, we'll be shining anyway, we'll see

You know, can't nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'til we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'til the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you've got

Ooh, my, my, baby, don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So, baby, come with me and be my ooh, la-la
Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me 'round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So, baby, come with me and be my ooh, la-la

You don't have to wear no designer clothes
Just as long as we're dancing on the floor
Fingers in my hair and I'm letting go tonight, so free

You know, can't nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'til we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'til the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you've got

Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here

With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh, please make my wish come true

Butterfly from the bottom of the ocean
I can't stop this slow motion trip...
Run away with me, no politics
Such a perfect notion
Your gravity has got me
Bowing in devotion
You and me fit a magic trick...

If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing

If we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing

One look at him and I see
Candy-coated heart shapes
The jewels and furniture can go
But baby, he stays
He plays sitar, three notes so far

If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
I know the music's good (wait, did you get that?)
If we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing
I know that we'll be good

My chakra's all been green and red
But he wants blue and green instead... (let's just do it over)
My chakra's all been green and red

But the stars in the sky
Look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone

Crossed through the universe to get where you are
Travelled the night, riding on a shooting star
Was lonely then
Like an alien
Had to get used to the world I was on
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belonged
Oh, that was then
Like an alien

But the stars in the sky
Look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone

'Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone

I try every night, to turn the page
But daylight can't confine me to a cage
In my mind, the life we had replays
Now everywhere, I turn I see your face

'Cause you came and you gave me a place
Place to lay all my pain
Why'd you take it away?

You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone

You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
'Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone

All the memories, I'm saving
So your love is never fading
Holding on my heart is breaking
Can't let go

You never know what you got 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
'Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone

They couldn't believe I did it, but I was so committed
My life was so restricted for you (For you)
I just dove inside it blind, couldn't see what swam inside
Thought that'd be romantic for you

Exchanged my vows and said it all, on the ledge prepared to fall
Even screaming "damn it" for you (Remember?)
My friends said you would play me, but I just said they're crazy
While I was crying frantic, was it true?

Why should I be sad? Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Let's just take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)

It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)

I sent you to Vegas with a pocket full of paper
And with no ultimatums on you
I thought "What could separate us?" But it just seemed that Vegas
Only brought the player outta you (Hey baby, what's your name?), you think?

Lavish homes and fancy cars, even got the drop Ferrari
Filled up our garage for you
Made your choice with all the teams, People and Us magazines
Tell me, who'd I do that for? Who?

Why should I be sad? Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Let's just take it all as a sign that we're through (Ah, c'mon, goodbye)

It's time for me to move along (Goodbye, c'mon)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright, c'mon)

It's time for me to get it on (Okay, c'mon)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go), ah, c'mon

And don't you worry about our angels
All the magazines trying to intervene, saying things in the gossip section
They'll get good guidance and be trained well
Don't worry, I'll keep our little secret, but I ask this question

Why should I be sad? Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Let's just take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)

It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)

Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

Un-un-uncontrollably

I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt I got running through my mind, woah

To keep both my hands above the bla-blanket

I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
I'm going to places I can be out of control

And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly
I love myself, it's not a sin
I can't control what's happening

'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

The small of my back, the arch of my feet
Lately I've been noticing the beautiful me
I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait
I'm into myself in the most precious way

And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide (To hide)
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly

'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

There's a world undefined
In my body and mind
I won't be left behind
I'm already here

'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand

10PM 'til four and I came to hit the floor
Thought you knew before, but if you don't, then now you know
Yo, tonight, I'm 'bout to mash, make them other chicks so mad
I'm 'bout to shake my ass, snatch that boy (So fast)

It's all about me and you, doing how we do
Tear the floor up, up, up, tell 'em to make room
If they wanna know, tell 'em mind their own
But if they wanna look, we can give 'em a encore

Make it a freak show (Freak), freak show
We can give 'em a peep-peepshow (Peep), peep-peepshow (Peepshow)
Don't stop it, let it flow, let your inhibitions go
It's a crazy night, let's make a, make a freak show

Make it a freak-freak show (Freak), freak show, a freak show
Make it a freak-freak show (Freak), freak show, a freak show

Make 'em clap when we perform
Wanna be crazy? We can show 'em
Dancing table top, freaky, freaky
So outside the norm (So outside the norm)
On some super star ish, pushing hot Bugatti whips
Rocking new designer fits, we can do it if you're with it

It's all about me and you, doing how we do
Tear the floor up, up, up, tell 'em to make room
If they wanna know, tell 'em mind their own
But if they wanna look, we can give 'em a encore

Freak-freak show (Freak), freak show, a freak show

Me and my girls 'bout to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Said me and my girls 'bout to get it on

I've been thinking, just sitting thinking
On why I love you and all the reasons
And if I lost you, boy, if I lost you
I'd lose myself, and I wouldn't feel the way I feel now
You bring me zen, yes, you bring me zen
And you make me feel like a million billion
I'll let you in, but don't you break my heart
Don't you rip me apart, oh, don't you rip me apart

Baby love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

I don't know how to say it

I've got visions, boy, I've got visions
Of me and you happily just livin'
I know they're out there, them beautiful men
But you my future, baby, you my right now
If there was a scale from one to ten
My love for you is a million billion
Boy, I'll love you 'til the day I'm dead
So please don't mess with my head, please don't mess with my head

Baby love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated

I don't know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

Some critics labelled it “her best vocal performance on the album.”
If they told me it's over, I wouldn't believe it
Because you know we both care
But we gotta get over, over the mountain
We can't keep standing, standing there
Let's move on and be stronger
Even though we can't go let go
Can't hold on, when love's broken

This is going to be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry

Don't cry, don't cry, cry, cry
Don't cry, cry, don't cry
Don't cry, cry, cry

In the beginning, we were both crazy
We were crazy in love
Now that it's ending, we are just crazy
Because we love with no trust
Can't go on any longer
Babe, we gotta let it go
Move on, can't hold on, when love's broken

This is going to be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry
This is going to be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry

There's a girl in the mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did
There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes

When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken easily

'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh, the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do

If I could, I would tell her
Not to be afraid
The pain that she's feeling
The sense of loneliness will fade
So dry your tears and rest assured
Love will find you like before

When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily
'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there’s nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh, the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh, I wish there was something I could do

I can't believe it's what I see
That the girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Is me
I can't believe what I see
(That the girl in my mirror)
That the girl in the mirror
Is me
Oh, is me

'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh, the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh, I wish there was something I could do

My favorite kiss, your perfect skin, your perfect smile
Waking up and you're next to me (I feel you next to me)
Wrap me up in your arms and back to sleep

The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes (Lay my head on your chest and drift away)
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time
The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes (Dream of you and I'm almost half awake)
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop

Fell in love with you and everything that you are
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you

Just tell me when, just tell me where, I'll come to you
Take me back to that place in time
Images of you occupy my mind

You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time
The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes (Dream of you and you're almost next to me)
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop (Yeah)

I fall off the edge of my mind (The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes)

I fall off the edge of my mind for you (You're taking me so far)

Fell in love with you and everything that you are (Your touch)

Loneliness up ahead
Emptiness behind, where do I go?

And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know
Still, I miss you somehow?

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you

"Baby," I said, "Please stay" (Stay)
"Give our love a chance for one more day," oh
We could've worked things out (Taking time is what it's all about)

You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still, I wish you were here now

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know (A thing or two you gotta know)
And you were my first love
You were my first love (First love), you were my true love

Don't knock on my door

Not this time, because I recognize
I've heard it all before, and I

I think of all the time that I wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in

Don't tell me how to feel
Or say that you're for real
My mind's made up, I'm cool without ya
You got no more appeal
Now this girl don't need no man
To say what she can do or what she can't
Now I live for me
Boy, does that make you weep?

Not this time, because I realize
I've heard it all before, and I

Think of times you made me cry
You had me so confused
I'm tired of trying, I'll leave behind this
What's a girl to do?

I think of all the times you made me sick
I used to think I couldn't handle it
What you think, I'm just another chick?
Messed with Brit, boy, you must have tripped
What were you thinking when you lost my trust?
You had it all, now you're left with nothing
Ooh, baby, now I know you want my touch
And now you're lonely and you still want me

I think of all the time that I wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it
Better off alone and I won't turn back

Breathe you out, breathe you in
You keep coming back to tell me
You're the one who could have been
And my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away, but it never disappears

Try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself, and don't look back

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
And maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under)

So, let me go, just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper
And much darker every day
Watch me now, and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for every one but you

Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I've told a thousand times

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
And maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under

And part of me still believes
When you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes
We can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So, let's just say goodbye forever

I don't wanna dream about

Said you're gonna be here in a minute

And I know exactly what you came for
Try to say goodbye, but it's hot and heavy

You touch me, and it's breaking me down
And me down, and me down, and me down
I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down
And get down, and get down
So, c'mon

Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth, and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby
You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out, inside out

I know that we probably shouldn't do this
Wake up in the morning, feeling stupid
Said that we were done, but you're all up on me
Said that we were done, but you're all up on me
Tell me how we got in this position
Guess I gotta get you out my system
Try to let you go, but it's not that easy
Try to let you go, but it's not that easy

You touch me, and it's breaking me down
And me down, and me down, and me down

Kinda cool, baby, we can make plans
Where you live? Do your mama live there?
We can hook up at the hotel
He was down, so I told him, "Let's go"

I used to be your girlfriend and I know I did it well
Oh yes, you know it's true
You'd call me Cinderella
All you had to do was yell, and I'd be there for you

Here I am, so try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairytales
Here we are with nothing but honesty
I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish
Aah, but Cinderella's got to go

From time to time, I tried to tell just what was on my mind
You'd tell me, "Not today"
"Come back, do that"
"Where's Cinderella at?"
Was all you had to say

Here I am, so try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairytales
Here we are with nothing but honesty
I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish
Aah, but Cinderella's got to go
I'm sorry, just trying to live my life
Don't worry, you're gonna be alright
But Cinderella's got to go

I used to say I want you
You cast me in your spell
I did everything you wanted me to
But now I shall break free from all your lies
I won't be blind, you see
My love, it can't be sacrificed
I won't return to thee

I'm so sorry, I've already made up my mind
I won't return to thee
I'm sorry to say, I'm running away now
Don't worry, you will be alright
I'm running away, I've made up my mind now
You're gonna have to let me go

I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish
Aah, but Cinderella's got to go
I'm sorry, just trying to live my life
Don't worry, you're gonna be alright
But Cinderella's got to go

Sometimes I just love to have that out
Just something a girl's gotta do, oh

Never thought I'd see you like this
You're looking good when you're half-dressed
Just let me give you one last test
Is that a sin? (No)
Am I too hot for you though?
Did you check out my video?
There's some things you don't know
Like this

I dare you to stand in my way
Just give in
When you are ready to play
Uh, like this

Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
'Cause if we break up, then we can make up
Shake my body all night
Here comes the showdown, oh

I don't really wanna be a tease
But would you undo my zipper, please?
Uh-uh, please don't talk
Listen
I'll let you touch me if you want
I see your body rise, rise
And when you come, don't get too hot
Butterfly

I dare you to stand in my way
Just give in
When you are ready to play
Uh, like this

Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
'Cause if we break up, then we can make up
Shake my body all night
Here comes the showdown, oh

Forget the tension when we fight
You make it up, turn down the light
It's just a lover's game we play, yeah
After the screaming's at an end
Why don't we do it all again?
That's when the fun really begins, ooh-oh

Here comes the showdown
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
'Cause if we break up, then we can make up
Shake my body all night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Here comes the showdown, oh
Here comes the showdown, oh
What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh
(Yeah)

I got all tricked out and came up to this thing
Looking so fire hot, a twenty out of ten
I saw you watching me watching you on the floor
Hitting me up like, "What you waiting for?"

It's alright to say you want it
Get inside my dirty mind
Burns like ice, the way I bring it
Again and again and again all night

The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down

Down and up and down and up
And down and up and down
Down and up and down and up
And down and up and down

All of them girls you're with are probably hating me
But I don't care, because I know it's jealousy
They see me on you like they think I'll give it up
But I ain't easy, just not afraid to rush

It's alright to say you want it
Get inside my dirty mind
Burns like ice the way I bring it
Again and again and again all night

I can tell that's what you're tripping on
Tripping on, tripping on
I can almost feel my lace slipping off 'cause of the bass
I can tell that's what you're tripping on
Tripping on, tripping on

Everybody's looking for something

I'm ferocious when I see you instantly
So precocious, assuming that you're into me
So fierce, the way you pierce me with your energy
My heart's on fire, boy, come on and rescue me

When I see you, I need you right away (Taking me)
Can't control the way that I am behaving
It's got a hold of me, grabbing me rapidly
Romantic dancing, dreams are made of this, yeah

Everybody, come on, get to jumping
Everybody, moving next to something
Everybody, feel the temperature rising
Everybody, come on, let's keep grinding

It's so real to feel you standing next to me
So intense when your scent's in my vicinity
Body shaking, aching, I can't take it
How I want you so bad, boy, that I can taste it now

When I see you, I need you right away (Taking me)
Can't control the way that I am behaving
It's got a hold of me, grabbing me rapidly
Romantic dancing, dreams are made of this, yeah

Everybody, come on, get to jumping
Everybody, moving next to something
Everybody, feel the temperature rising
Everybody, come on, let's keep grinding

Fellas, get wild, start flashing your money
Ladies, go crazy and act a fool
Everybody get down and do what you want to
The night is still young to be seduced

Taking in with every little thing I see
Triple title dancing with the tab complete
Little boys dancing 'cause they're feeling me
Sweating cold, fretting, it's the place to be
Come and sit with me, come and sit with me
Sit back, you'll see it so beautifully
Lovin' everybody, baby, is all you need
Let go of the way things used to be

Everybody, come on, get to jumping (Everybody)
Everybody, moving next to something (Move your body)
Everybody, feel the temperature rising (Oh)
Everybody, come on, let's keep grinding
Everybody, come on, get to jumping (Let your body move, oh)
Everybody, moving next to something
Everybody, feel the temperature rising
Everybody, come on, let's keep grinding

Everybody
Everybody (J-J-J-J-J.R.)
Everybody's looking for something
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody's looking for something

It appears on the deluxe edition of her seventh studio album, Femme Fatale.
I'm touching hands with someone seriously beautiful, eh, ah-eh, eh
I feel it burning and I know I'm standing far too close, eh, ah-eh, eh
I'm telling lies and if it shows I see that he don't care, eh, ah-eh, eh
I know he wants to take me home and get on out of here, eh, ah-eh, eh

I got someone waiting at home
He says he in love, but lately I just don't know
He don't see me or make me feel hot
Banging in the club with all my ladies and he don't know that

He about to lose, 'bout to lose, 'bout to lose me
He about to lose me, eh, eh
He about to lose, 'bout to lose, 'bout to lose me
He about to lose me, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh

I feel my body losing focus as he touches me, eh, ah-eh, eh
And I should go, but I can't overcome this chemistry, eh, ah-eh, eh
He pulls me close before he whispers something in my ear, eh, ah-eh, eh
He says he wants to take me home and get me out of here, eh, ah-eh, eh

I got someone waiting at home
He says he in love, but lately I just don't know
He don't see me or make me feel hot
Banging in the club with all my ladies and he don't know that

He about to lose me, eh, eh
He about to lose, 'bout to lose, 'bout to lose me
He about to lose me, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh

Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing
I see him staring at me, I see what he wants to be
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing
I gotta, I gotta go, he don't know that

He about to lose, 'bout to lose, 'bout to lose me
He about to lose me, eh, eh
He about to lose, 'bout to lose, 'bout to lose me
He about to lose me, eh, eh

19 ContributorsAmnesia Lyrics“Amnesia” is a song recorded by Britney Spears for her sixth studio album, Circus. The song only appears on the British and Japanese editions of the album as a bonus track.
I saw him standing there in the parking lot
He asked if I came here a lot
And this is how I responded

I forgot my name
I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me, he don't even know it
I forgot my address
Damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend was the one that had bought me this rock

I get amnesia when I'm standing next to you
He's been with me for several years, I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over 'til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't forget about me

I talk to my girls
I can talk to my girls, like crazy
To anyone, I'll speak my mind
I tell them off, it don't phase me
I'm not lazy, but boy lately
When I see you, I stutter
Words just slip away, like butterflies
I saw you standing there in the V.I.P. on Friday
We conversate up in my fantasies, like every day
But I'm a dud whenever you approach
Like yesterday, when you just came to say "Hello"

I forgot my name
I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me, he don't even know it
I forgot my address
Damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend was the one that had bought me this rock

I get amnesia when I'm standing next to you
He's been with me for several years, I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over 'til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't forget about me
Me, me
This is how I do

I talk to most guys
I can talk to most guys like crazy
To anyone, I'll speak my mind
I tell them off, it don't phase me
But you shake me, boy, you make me stop and stutter
When we touch, I melt like butter
I saw you standing there in the V.I.P. on Saturday
Now that I know you got a thing for me, I should be straight
Not the kinda girl who'll just let any guy get close
All I can say, is I'mma tell my guy he should just effin' go

I forgot my name
I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me, he don't even know it
I forgot my address
Damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend was the one that had bought me this rock

I get amnesia when I'm standing next to you
He's been with me for several years, I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over 'til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't forget about me
Me, me

19 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsEspañolShadow LyricsBritney talks about how her lover is physically present with her but not emotionally, using the shadow as a metaphor of his lack of emotion.
Your body's warm, but you are not
You give a little, not a lot
It could be love until we kiss
You're all I want, but not like this
I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

It's only your shadow
Never yourself
It's only your shadow
Nobody else
It's only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon

Your body gives, but then holds back
The sun is bright, the sky is black
Can only be another sign
I cannot keep what isn't mine
Your laughter, it lingers on
But you, you were almost gone

It's only your shadow
Never yourself
It's only your shadow
Nobody else
It's only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon

How can I tell if you mean what you say?
You say it so loud, but you sound far away
Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul
Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall?
I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

It’s only your shadow
Never yourself
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
No, no, no
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
Ooh, oh
It’s only your shadow

She don't want no sleep, she don't want no high
Oh, like peaches and cream

She lands on both feet, won't take a back seat
There's a brave new girl, and she's coming out tonight

She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?
Her M.O.'s changed
She don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?

Tonight, it's alright
A brave girl tonight

So, she met this man, he was kind of rough
He said, "Girl, what you looking for?"
She said, "I don't know, I go with the flow"
He said, "Let's get on the floor"
He said, "You look real cute with your low ride jeans and your pink little Bebe tee"
"Let's get a room, girl, come and ride with me"

She wants the good life, no need to rewind
She needs to really, really find what she wants
She lands on both feet, won't take a back seat
There's a brave new girl, and she's coming out tonight

She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive?

She don't wanna behave
Ain't it good to be a brave girl tonight?

Tonight, it's alright

I just keep on running

Dear diary
Today I saw a boy
And I wondered if he noticed me
He took my breath away

Dear diary
I can't get him off my mind
And it scares me 'cause I've never felt this way
No one in this world
Knows me better than you do
So diary, I'll confide in you

Dear diary
Today I saw that boy
As he walked by, I thought he smiled at me

And I wondered
Does he know what's in my heart?
I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe
Should I tell him how I feel
Or would that scare him away?
Diary, tell me what to do
Please tell me what to say

Dear diary
One touch of his hand
Now I can't wait to see that boy again
He smiled
And I thought my heart could fly
Diary, do you think that we'll be more than friends?
I've got a feeling we'll be so much more than friends

Someone tell me I, I will be alright

Holding on with all of my might
And when I'm lost, and I can't find the way
I feel the pieces breaking away
Hug myself with all of my might
Don't let go, just hold on tight

He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight

Four years ago I had a party
That was too much fun for me
Boy, there's a sexy guy

I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun, yeah
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I've just begun, don't wanna settle down

He started touching me and kissing me like he didn't care
I thought at first I should go home, but then fell asleep in the chair

You took your love away too fast
Left no chance to say, "Look back"
And now I know the truth, it makes it easier
Maybe when time goes by, I’ll understand

Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away

You threw it all away
So blind (So blind)
You pushed me far from you in your life
Now I know the tears won’t lead to loneliness
Maybe when time goes by, I’ll understand

Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away, I run away


Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away
Let’s pretend that I’ve moved on
And I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away

Black jack, whiskey straight
Every day changes your life
You got the look that you know you're real bad
Yeah, baby, you're right
Everybody loves you, baby, you're the king of the night
And I'm the only one making sure I stay out of your sight

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

Me and you were a disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without you
That's why you're so good for everybody else, but you're trouble for me

Oh, oh, oh-oh

And close the doors of doubt
Revive my dignity, but

By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (oh yeah!)

My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or little bars
Really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wondered what was off limits
Staring at you til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this was all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we could tell that there's changes coming
See I could tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go
Like Penelope in "Blow"
Well worth the stealing you, it's a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
Cause I got me for life
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul
I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keeping me alive
I don't need anything to make me satisfied
Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time

And as far as I can see I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me get a world that they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
Cause this hunger is driving me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speaking on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends, we don't take L's we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends

And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

Baby, cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
(Yeah, you make me oooh...)

[Song 143: Before the Goodbye]
16 ContributorsTranslationsBritney Spears - Before the Goodbye (Tradução em Português)Before the Goodbye Lyrics
Laying here in your arms, and you hold me tight, tight
Trying not to watch the clock tick, ticking as the time goes by
And I know that you best be on your way
But I'm wishing I could make you stay, stay with me for a while

Though you're near, still I wanna make it clear
Love, I will always be around

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

Kinda hard for me to let you know
Still don't let my feelings show how much I will miss in you
All the little things that make me weak
Your eyes and the way you speak, without you, baby, I'm not me

Though you're near, still I wanna make it clear
Love, I will always be around

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye
I feel it already, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

You're leaving, I'm waiting, forgive me
I'm always missing you before the goodbye

[Song 144: When Your Eyes Say It]
20 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsWhen Your Eyes Say It Lyrics
I love to hear you say that you love me
With words so sweet
And I love the way with just one whisper
You tell me everything
And when you say those words
It's the sweetest thing I've ever heard

But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes say it

I love all the ways that you show me
You'll never leave
And the way your kisses, they always convince me
Your feelings run so deep
I love the things you say
And I love the love your touch conveys

But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right
When your eyes say it

And the words that say take my breath away
No song ever sounded so sweet
I love every word that they say to me

But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right
When your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right

Lying in bed, touching my skin
Oh God, I wish you weren't sleeping
I long for your lips, to kiss me again
Don't you know my body's aching?

Seems we always have a little price to pay
Price to pay, I'm falling in love
It all starts, starts to ache

Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But good girls and good little boys
Will make love together

I look at your face, as I lie awake
My body's slowly moving closer
My hand on your leg
My mouth on its way
Oh baby, I'll just turn you over

Seems we always have a little price to pay
Price to pay, I'm falling in love
It all starts, starts to ache

Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But good girls and good little boys
Will make love together
Love together, love together
Love together, love together
Love together

Do you like this? I like this
I want you alright
Do you want to touch me?
I like this
Can you handle this?
I like this
We're going to slow it down
Just a little bit
I'm lying in bed, touching my skin
I just can't take it, baby
Open your eyes, whisper to me
Do it again, do it again

Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But good girls and good little boys
Will make love together
Bad girls, and bad little boys
Won't last forever
But good girls and good little boys
Will make love together
Love together, love together
Love together, love together
Love together

That's good, do you like this?
Yeah, going to slow it down
We'll make love together

[Song 146: Autumn Goodbye]
17 ContributorsTranslationsTiếng ViệtAutumn Goodbye Lyrics“Autumn Goodbye” is a song recorded by Britney Spears for her debut studio album, …Baby One More Time.
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye

Thinking of you and the love of our lives
(In the sweet summertime)
So sad, but true (So true, so true)
We must leave it behind
In our hearts, in our minds

From April through September
Bittersweet (was the love that we share)
Don't forget; I remember

I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

Memories can fade (they can fade)
But my heart has a place for the smile on your face (on your face)
And maybe someday we can be more than friends
Love will find us again
Red leaves and blue tomorrows
Time will give back the love that we shared
On the time that we borrowed

I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

From April through September
Bittersweet (was the love that we share)
Don't forget; I remember, baby

I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye

We'll leave behind the summertime
Our hearts, our minds
(They will remind
We won't forget
The day we met
The day we cried
Autumn goodbye)

I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
Autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending (You never said)
You never said you wouldn't make me cry (But summer love)
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and
Hey, oh, yeah

I don't wanna hear that I'm too young
To know it's love that makes me feel this way
'Cause I don't have to feel the heat of the sun
To know it's shining on me every day
When it's warm outside
And the look in your eyes
Is longing to show me the way, no, no
I don't want to wait

Just one kiss from you, and suddenly Yeah
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms, you make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you

I don't wanna hear my time will come
When it feels like it's already here
We should learn to walk before we run
But why go anywhere when you're so near?
'Cause when I reach out to you
So sad and confused
And feeling like I could cry
You dry my eyes

Just one kiss from you, and suddenly yeah
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms, you make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you

I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life
On and on and

Just one kiss from you, and suddenly
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms
You make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you

I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life

On a shameless night, in a nameless place
I thought that love was a hopeless case
'Til I found you
'Til I found you
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city
There was no love just pain and pity
'Til I found you
'Til I found you

And you don't know how you saved me
And you don't know what you gave me
And you don't know how you saved my life

I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
I can live my life
I believe in faith
I have found myself
I have lost the hate
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

On a shameless night, in a nameless place
I thought that love was a hopeless case
'Til I found you
'Til I found you
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city
There was no love just pain and pity
'Til I found you
'Til I found you

And you don't know how you saved my life

I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

All my life I've waited for this day
Have waited for you, now I adore you
All my life I've waited for this day
Have waited for you, now I adore you

I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

Will you turn me up?
Yeah

This is the making of another cold, rude awakening
It's been too long anticipating
Hurry up for my demonstration
So give undivided attention
Okay, light speed, turbo, to get to me
Don't play, joke around, one shot
You're killing me

Don't keep me waiting

Come, and take it from me

Come, and take it from me

Come, and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come, and take it from me

The time is ticking
The train is boarding, you might miss it
Follow directions, damn it, listen
Before my body's in remission
So, come to your destination

Okay, light speed, turbo, to get to me

Standing outside, I'm standing outside
What the hell? I'm standing outside
Colder than the freezer
Come out, and melt my ice
I'm running out of time
You're changing my demeanor
So get me to your ride, before I change my mind
Don't apologize

Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
My body's waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Heart, I know I’ve been hard on you
I’m sorry for the things I’ve put you through
Before you start to break on me or ask for sympathy
I need to make you see
Oh, heart, I’m not sure it’s been long enough
To say that what I feel is really love
There’s just one way to learn, sometimes we’ll get hurt
And right now it’s our turn

Give it time, help me through
Heart, we can do this together
You’re my strength, you’re my soul
I need you now more than ever

Heart, all the hurt will soon be gone
If you’ll, if you’ll just keep on being strong
You will always be my friend, so keep on hanging in
And we’ll find love again

Give it time, help me through help me
Heart, we can do this together
You’re my strength, you’re my soul my strength
I need you now more than ever

Heart, I know I’ve been hard on you
I’m sorry for the things I put you through
Please don’t you break on me, I need to make you see
It wasn’t meant to be
'Cause you will always be my friend, so keep on hanging in
And we’ll find love again
