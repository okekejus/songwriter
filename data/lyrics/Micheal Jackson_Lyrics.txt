She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Don't break no hearts; hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee-hee, ah, hee-hee-hee)

Hee, hoo

She says I am the one, uh
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no, hoo, ohh)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no (No-no-no, ah), no-no-no-no (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (No)
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)

She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breakin' my heart, babe)
She says I am the one
Yeah, yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl)
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; don't call me Billie Jean, hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; she's not at the scene)
Billie Jean is not (Hee), aaow, ooh
Yeah, Billie Jean is

Ow!
Cha!
Shoo-ca-choo-ca!

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet

You were struck down
It was your doom

You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A smooth criminal
Ow!

So they came in to the out way
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
He's leaving no clues left behind him
And he had no way of knowing
Of the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

It was your doom, Annie (Doggone it)

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller, here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow)

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Ooh, babe (Thriller night)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Oh, darling (Oh, baby)
Thriller night, babe (Thriller night, babe)
Ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

Think about, um, the generations, and, uh, say we wanna make it a better place for our children and children's children so that they, they, they s— they know it's a better world for them. Think they can make it a better place...

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
Make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Make it a better place (Better place)

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh, yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ohh yeah!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man, you know, that man)
(Well I'll change!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that

Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh

They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em, "I ain't second to none"

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, hoo

Gone wit' ya, babe
Hee-hee

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Go when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Go when the going gets mean

Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from, it's where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye (Hee-hee)
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

I know your every move, so won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time, you won't seduce me

She's saying "That's okay, hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back", she trapped me in her heart

She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

She's saying "That's okay, hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star"

But I hate sleeping alone, why don't you come with me?"
I said "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright"

Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that, I ran to the phone saying, "Baby, I'm alright"
I said "But unlock the door, 'cause I forgot the key"
She said "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me"

Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

I never woulda thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me

Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away (Rock, right)

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

When you feel that heat
And we gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We gon' rock the night away

And when the groove is dead and gone (Yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever on
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

I wanna rock (All night)
With you, girl (Sunlight)
Rock with you, rock with you, girl (Yeah)

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin

Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone, oh-oh-oh

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin', fly
And girl, you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you (Ooh)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone (You are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away, you and me)
I am here to stay
But you are not alone (You are always in my heart)
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh-oh)

('Lone, 'lone) You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
('Lone, 'lone) You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
('Lone, 'lone) If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
('Lone, 'lone) Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh
('Lone, 'lone) Together, together
('Lone, 'lone) Not, not being alone
Not, not being alone
You believe in me

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?

Do you remember (I'll make you remember)

What about us, girl?

In the park, on the beach
(Remember the time) You and me in Spain
What about, what about?

Every night, she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine, mhm

I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well, I love you endlessly
(Loving, we will share)
So come and go with me to one town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day, you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine

Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?
Ha, ha, Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover, not a fighter
Eh, I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yeah, she said it; you keep dreaming

(I don't believe it!) (Mine, mine)

I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me, don't hide our love

It's worth the givin', it's worth the try

Oh, because there's somethin' about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's somethin' about you, baby (Oh)

Just promise me whatever we say or whatever we do to each other

Jam, jam, said you wanna get up and jam
Jam, jam, said you wanna get up and jam

Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

Jam (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff

It ain't too much for me to
Jam, it ain't (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff

It ain't too much for me

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal hat, the man is Mike, so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first, I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
'Cause it ain't too hard to

The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee-hee!)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl, I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said "You know my name"
(She called me!)
"And don't you pretend you never did me before"
(Don't you, don't you, do it!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't you) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!

I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby!

And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Dog gone!) (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Woah!) (Oh, yeah!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

The girl is so dangerous (Hoo-hee! Hoo!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
My baby
You been, you take, uh
You don't, don't, don't
You turn, my baby

Gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you will always be the lady in my life

Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl

And I will keep you warm through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And, baby, through the years
Even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day

I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

And she promised me forever and a day we'd live as one
We made our vows, we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret that she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue, tell me what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter and it doesn't seem right
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune, still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure 'cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me, did she find in someone else?

(Who is it?)
Is it a friend of mine?
(27716580)
Is it my brother?

Somebody hurt my soul now
(27716580)
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever that we'd live our life as one
We made our vows, we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me for such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth, but see, what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter and it doesn't seem right
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune, still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure 'cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter, she just up and ran away

Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, we never were
Just won't stop
Don't bother me, don't bother me

'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune, still, I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm bothered every day

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (Ah), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do" (I do)
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you (Woah-oh)
I just can't stop loving you (If I stop)
And if I stop (Uh-huh)
Then tell me just what will I do (Woah-oh)
I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you (No, baby, oh)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop (Oh, oh)
Then tell me just what will I do (Oh, oh, what will I do?)

She's out of my life

And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years, she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside!
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now, you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now, you do regret it

To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side (Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now, she's out to get me
But I just can't take it, just can't break it

Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie got your number and Susie says it right

She got your number, ah, how does it feel, ah
To know this stranger, ah, is about to kill?
Ah, she got your baby, ah, it happened fast, ah

There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know it's fled its tomb
Because now it's haunting me, I don't understand it!

Hey!
I don't understand it!
Aaow!

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, I don't understand it!

Got a ghost, got a break in the walls (Hey!)
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby, she needs me

She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone

Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me

Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me

You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay, yes, it's okay
You won't be laughing, girl, when I'm not around
I'll be okay, and I'd, I'd never find
Better, a peace of mind, no


Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Talk to me, woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me
Oh, love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me, give in to me


I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to the fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
I'd like a lady
Talk to me, baby
Give in to me
Give in to the fire
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Love is wrong
Give in to me
Give in to me

'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire

And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me (You can't break me), 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it (I'm unbreakable), you can't conceive it

And I know you hate it (Come on, now), and you can't take it (Yeah)

You can't stand it because I'm unbreakable

You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here (Be here)
Through all your lies and silly games, I'ma still remain the same
I'm (Uh, uh) unbreakable (What? Uh)

A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly .9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you in
Crack baggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert E's, street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messing with the devil, what?

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (Yeah)
And you can't touch me, ah (I'm untouchable), 'cause I'm untouchable ('Cause I'm untouchable)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me (Yeah), 'cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (You, you, you, you, you)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it (You hate it), and you can't take it (Ooh)
You'll never break me (I'm unbreakable), 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it, (Hoo, hoo, hoo), you can't conceive it

I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side (Ooh)
Every moment takes me to paradise
Darlin', let me hold you
I'll warm you in my arms and melt your fears away
Show you all the magic that a perfect love can make
I need you night and day

So baby, be mine (Baby, you gotta be mine), ooh
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time), ooh
And we can share this ecstasy
As long as we believe in love

(Ooh)
Ooh-ooh

I won't give you reason to change your mind
(I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
You are all the future that I desire
Girl, I need to hold you
Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace
Show you all the passion burnin' in my heart today
It's never gonna fade

So baby, be mine (Baby, you gotta be mine), ooh
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time), ooh
You're everything this world could be
The reason that I live, oh

Won't you stay with me until the morning sun?
I promise you now that the dawn will be different
Lady, can't you see that heaven's just begun?
It's living here inside our hearts

There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
This will be a love lasting for all time
Girl, you got to hold me
We can touch the sky and light the darkest day
Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way
There's no more I can say

So baby, be mine (Baby, you gotta be mine)
(Tell me that you love me all the time)
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give (Say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine (Girl, be mine, all the time)

You're everything this world could be (Every night)

(Money)
(Money) Lie for it, spy for it
Kill for it, die for it

So you call it trust, but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church, read the holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge, you're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you, my friend, but

If you show me the cash, then I will take it (Ah)
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it (Ah)
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

Insurance? Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? (Ah) I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your god is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles, the idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers

If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it (Ah)
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it (Ah)
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)

You say you wouldn't do it for all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man, then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie, then I will tell him
If it's dealing with God, then you will hell Him
You would do anything for money

Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel, but I am

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am far away and nothing is for real

When I'm with you, I am lost for words
I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel
So silently, I pray

Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you, I'm in the light where I can not be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called 'Hallowed Ground'

Speechless (Speechless), speechless (Speechless)
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you (Ooh)
I am far away and nothing is for real

I'd go anywhere and do anything
Just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I can not climb
I'm humbled in your grace

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel (You're always in my heart)
Though I'm with you
I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence, I am lost for words
Words like... like, "I love you"

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear
May be ever so near

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky

If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile, and maybe tomorrow

Girl, you got to understand

Break of dawn

I don't want the sun to shine, I want to make love (It's the break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart (It's the break of dawn)

Let's not wait, the sun is out, let's get up and let's get out
It's the day, a brand new day, let's both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, makin' love till it's dark
Let me move, let me soothe, till the break of dawn and you know it's true, oh

I don't want the sun to shine, I wanna make love (Break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart (Break of dawn)
I don't know what I'm gon' do, I can't stop lovin' you (It's the break of dawn)

Close your eyes and drift away

Is he getting nearer? I feel some heat is on my back

Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway

Go, go, go, aaow!

[Song 58: Tabloid Junkie]
63 ContributorsTabloid Junkie LyricsOn this song, Michael addresses people that believe everything the media says, and sings about their lies and how ignorant the media is.
In the news today from the strange and weird fact file
Singer Michael Jackson sleeps in a oxygen chamber
The singer says that the hyperbaric chamber has the benefits of reversing the aging process
(overlapping voices)
This just in, singer Michael Jackson has a shrine to Elizabeth Taylor in his Encino home

Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
It's the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next, for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
It's the blackmail story in all your glory

It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen, you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it (Read it)
And you don't have to eat it (Eat it)
To buy it is to feed it (Feed it)
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves?

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
(Though everybody wants to read all about it)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual

In the hood, frame him if you could
Shoot to kill, to blame him if you will
If he dies, sympathize
Such false witnesses, damn self-righteousness
In the black, stab me in the back
In the face, to lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
It's the headline stories of all your glory

It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it (Buy it)
And they won't glorify it ('Fy it)
To read it sanctifies it ('Fies it)
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves?

(Baby! Baby!)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
(Everybody wants to read all about it)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen (Believe it, baby)
Don't make it factual
(See, but everybody wants to believe all about it)
Just because you read it in a magazine (Release me)
Or see it on the TV screen (Somebody release me)
Don't make it factual
(See, but everybody wants to believe all about it)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual

(Overlapping voices)
Everybody got something to read about
Everybody got something rude to say
Everybody got some viscous scandal
Everybody's got some news to handle
I despise what they’re talking about
Everybody's talkin' 'bout every scandal
Then we got something to for someone to hold
A scandal and something for the news to say

Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anythin' for news
And you don't go and buy it (Buy it)
And they won't glorify it ('Fy it)
To read it sanctifies it ('Fies it)
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves?
Slander! You say it's not a sin
But with your pen, you torture men
But why do we keep foolin' ourselves?

(Baby! Baby!)
Just because you read it in a magazine (Believe it, baby!)
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual (Baby!)
Though everybody wants to read all about it (Yeah, oh-oh)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to read all about it (You better believe it)
Just because you read it in a magazine (Baby!)
Or see it on the TV screen (Believe it, baby!)
Don't make it factual (See, so many times, not a friend of mine)
Just because you read it in a magazine (Somebody, release me!)
Or see it on the TV screen (Believe it, baby!)
Don't make it factual (You better believe it, yeah, yeah)

Just because you read it in a magazine (Yeah, yeah)

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding 'round
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart, then ask
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood (Childhood)
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my childhood?

And quickly cooks his food

The kids must get to school

'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm

Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be out her mind

She works so hard just to make a way
For a man to just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still, she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance, she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed the pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love (Love, love, love)
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of

You got to have pride (A rhythm of love)
To give it, want it, do it, baby (A rhythm of love)

Grab my crotch, twist my knees, and I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad, who are you?

Too bad, too bad about it

As I drove across on the highway, my Jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped
Then got out and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, "Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there"

Oh, take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name (Yeah, oh)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to (Oh) a place without (Yeah) no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
At where kids are playin'
And people are laughin' and smilin' and nothin' to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness"
She turned around, looked down in my eyes
And started cryin'
Grab my hand, you've got a friend, oh

Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to (See) a place without no name
A place without no name
Take me to (Can't believe) a place without (I can't believe) no name
Take me to a place without no name

Whoa, yeah
Don't go, oh

She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done, this really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave?
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world, oh

Take me to (Don't go) a place
Without (I can't believe) no name (No name)
Take me to (See) a place without no name
Take me to (I can't believe) a place without (Don't go) no name

[Song 66: They Don’t Care About Us (Single Edit)]
4 ContributorsThey Don’t Care About Us (Single Edit) Lyrics
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Jew me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

Skinhead, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black male, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skinhead, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skinhead, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Kick me, kike me, don't you wrong or right me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

He gives a nervous smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been going on
She says, "Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"

"Everything will be alright", he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy"
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
See whatever happens, don't go of my hand
See whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, just don't let go of my hand

Gone one night

Like a sunset dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

And I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

It seems you don't know, we reached the highest mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heavens
I can really feel it when you're near, oh-hoo

And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

But, girl, you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you, but still, you say it ain't cool

If there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, and he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

But my baby loves me, though she acts like I'm not there

And you know damn well the girl will be mine
She's got the breaks, she's the scene
And you know damn well she gives it to me

Black jeans and a turtleneck sweater
I know the girl is fakin' 'cause

Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh, the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh, the blood in her hair

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain

But only the man from next door
Knew little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh, the blood in her hair

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there
She knew no one cared

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Neglecting the needs in her prayers

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh, it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair

[Song 77: We Are the World (Original Solo Demo)]
16 ContributorsWe Are the World (Original Solo Demo) Lyrics
There is a time when we should hear the certain calls
'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line
'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all
I used to feel I should give away my heart
And it shows that fear of needing them
Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there
And it shows that we must heed instead

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

Now there's a time when we must love them all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more
It seems in life, i didn't do that

We are the world, the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
We are the world, are the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
But there's a chance we're taking, taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Come on, yeah
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Oh yeah, we got it
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking

Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes, I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no

That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
I should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her (Oh)
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker (Doggone)
That girl, I can't take her (Oh)
I should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

She plays the game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now, she's thinking that I will never know
And she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same

That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her (That girl)
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker (Why'd you do it to me)

That girl, I can't take her (Oh)
Should have seen right through her (Doggone), she's a heartbreaker (Oh)

I never thought that I would stop dreaming about you
Stop being without you
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you
Start being without you
But I’ll find a way to go and start doing without you
Stop talking about you
And what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away

I can't blame her, I thought it was love with this game, huh? (Huh?)
When you dealing with emotions, it's pain ma (Mm-mm) (Yeah, alright)
Take a closer look, you're dealing with a stranger
I can't change her, now (Mm)
The heart burner one place then you'll see (Right)
It won't heal from Pepcid AC (Mm-mm) (Uh-huh)
Ball-hard player, she a star player
I need LensCrafters, I ain't seen the heartbreaker, come on (Take it from me)

That girl, I can't take her (Oh)
Should have known she was a heartbreaker (Doin' to me)
That girl (Oh), I can't take her (Doggone)
I should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker (Give it to me)
That girl, I can't take her (Oh)
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker (Should've seen it coming, baby)
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker (Should've seen it coming, baby)

So there's really no time to be trippin' on me

18 ContributorsYou Can’t Win Lyrics
You can't win, you can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
People keep saying things are going to change
But they look just like they're staying the same
You can't win, way over your head
And you only got yourself to blame

You can't win, child
You can’t break even
And you can't get out of the game

You can't win, the world keeps moving
And you're standing far behind
People keep saying, things will get better
(Just to ease your state of mind)
(So you lean back)(And you smoke that smoke)
(And you drink your glass of wine)

Sayin' you can't win, child
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

You can't win, you can't win, no way
If your story stays the same
(You ain’t winning) No, no
(But it's nice to see you, I'm awfully glad you came)
(Better cool it, 'cause it ain't about losin')
Then the world has got no shame

You can't win, child
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

You can't win, you can't break even
Ain’t the way it's supposed to be
(You'll be spending) No, no, oh
(Your little bit of money)
While someone else rides for free
(Learn your lesson) Hoo-hoo!
(Refuel your mind before some turkey blows out your flame)

You can't win, child
(No, you can't win) 

You can't win, child
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
You can't get out of the game
You can't get out, a-hoooooo!
You can't get out of the game now, hah!
No, no, ah, d'ah

Oh, ooh-ooh
Alright, ah

Feels like a fire that burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around for every day to start
I haven't left you alone
Something about you, the stare in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away is killing me inside
I need your love in my life

I wanna spend time 'til it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

Ooh-ooh
Ta-da-die

Fought in a battle where nobody won
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, the past is said and done
I need us to carry on, oh-oh-oh

I wanna spend time 'til it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

(Ooh-ooh)

You tried everything you never thought of before
When you live, when you love, when you give them your all
Always give up some more
Nothing here means anything, no, we
I can live, I can breathe, I can die in my sleep
You're always there in my dreams

I wanna spend time 'til it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
I wanna spend time 'til it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met (When we first met)
I wanna fall with you again

(Ooh-ooh)
Alright, alright
All of the time
Here in my heart
Let's go, great sound

Tonight's story is somewhat unique
And calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh, yes, I did forget something, didn't I?
I forgot to introduce you to the monster

You're fearing me 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watchin' you when you sleep
When you're in bed, I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall
And when you scream, it's 'cause of me

I'm the living dead
The dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should feel threatened by me

You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
In one blink, I'll disappear
And then, I'll come back to haunt you

I'm tellin' you
When you lie under tomb
I'm the one watchin' you
That's why you got to be threatened by me (No, no)

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened by me

The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened (No, no, baby)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened

(You should be)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(While you sleep)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(Every time)
(You should feel)
(Threatened)
(Half of me-e-e-e)
(Threatened by me)
(So you should feel thre-e-e-eatened by me)

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened (No, no, know it)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened (She speaks to me)
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should feel threatened (And you, threatened by me, hoo-hoo!)
You should be watchin' me (Come on, baby)
You should feel threatened (Yeah)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Hoo-hoo!)
Every time your lady speaks (I ain't threatened)
She speaks to me, threatened (Hoo-hoo, I ain't threatened)
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened by me

What you have just witnessed
Could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't
It's the beginning

Once, all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely

You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before, but now, it's all clear
You took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are my life (You are my life)

Now, I wake up every day
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me

You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You gave me strength
When I wasn't strong
You gave me hope when all hope was lost
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting for me

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)

You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)

Hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, oh

Father comes home from work
And he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he said, "What's goin' on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone"

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of stepdaddy using her
Sayin' that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone, somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothin' to eat

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock, yeah
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are, oh

Save me (From this living hell)
Save me ('Cause I, I wanna help)
Save me (I'm tired and I'm mad)
Save me ('Cause this, it ain't no joke)
Save me ('Cause I'm out for blood)
Save me ('Cause I don't wanna ignore)
Save me (It's time I replied)
Save me ('Cause I, I wanna defeat)
Save me

Hoo, hoo

Now, she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waitin' there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl, just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hot, girl, that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there, they told
He's arresting this little girl
Who's only twelve years old

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street

[Song 90: Can’t Let Her Get Away]
39 ContributorsCan’t Let Her Get Away Lyrics

I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now, I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie?
Is it just a lie
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true
Make a dream come true

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away (No)
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But everytime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still, you said goodbye
Still, you said goodbye

If I let her get away
Then the world will have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who set you free

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away (No)
I can't let, I can't let her get away

I got the feeling trouble's gotta stop
I got the feeling she's never gonna drop
I got the feeling she's never gonna stop
I got the feeling but she's never gonna know
My friends thought she's gonna like it
I got the feeling but she's never gonna take it
I got the feeling her head's all fucked up
I got the feeling she's out to play

(Can't let go, oh)
I got to let go, I got a feeling but she's never gonna let me
(Can't let go, oh)
Gotta see her, how are they gonna stop me?
I got a feeling, but she's never gonna be
Got a feeling, but she's gonna find a way
I never feel it, but she's never gonna find a way

I can't let, I can't let her get away (No, no)
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let
I can't let
I can't let
I can't let, I can't let her get away (Oh no)
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tan
In her painted-on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again

That chance again, babe
Ooh
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams, ah
Ah, and she's giving hot tricks to men, just to get in
She was taught that that's not clean
She's headed for the big time, that means
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again

That chance again, babe

She gave up her life (Ooh) to follow her dreams (Chance again, babe)
Left behind everything for the movie scene
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad (Woo!)
Now that she got her dream, she became a star
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Now it's back to reality for Ms. Hollywood (Woo!)

Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned
In her painted-on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again

That chance again, babe
You know it, baby

Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (That chance again, babe)
She's Hollywood (Woo!), she's Hollywood
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (That chance again, babe)
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood (You know it, baby)

 How many children will have to cry, before we do all we can?
 If sending your love is all you can give
 To help one live

 And pretend we cannot see

Healing the wounds of our broken earth
We are one global family
 Just sending your prayers

Is something you'll feel
Helping one heal

So let's all give

Just call my name

See, then why do they keep teaching us
Such hate and cruelty?
We should give over and over again
 What have I got that I can give?

There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of a heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghostly haunting everywhere

I'm gonna be exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me because you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see eccentric oddities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?
Ooh, babe

There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin, it lay open
Where a restless soul is smoking

I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
So tell me, is it scary for you, baby? Tell me, hoo!
So tell me, is it crazy for you, baby?
Am I scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you?

Masquerade the heart is to hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you seek of me
'Cause the heart reveals the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See, the evil one is you

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
So tell me, am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Is it scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Am I scary for you, boy? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)

(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
Is this scary for you, baby?
Is this scary for you?
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you, baby? Oh
Oh, baby

You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)

People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is takin' a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me, where were you
When your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness, oh
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)

There'll be no more wars (Ooh, why?)

[Song 95: The Lost Children]
41 ContributorsThe Lost Children Lyrics
We pray for our fathers
Pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing

So this one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

When you sit there addressing
Counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping
And my heart is weeping
Because I'm keeping a place

For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

Home with their fathers
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee

Let's pray for all the lost children
Let’s pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well and wishing them home

Eighty-five, ninety, ninety-five, one hundred
Here I come, ready or not
Last one into the forest is a rotten apple
It's so quiet in the forest
Look at all the trees
And all the lovely flowers
It's getting dark
We better go home now

And now a behind-the-scenes treat from the original voice-over session for "Thriller", with Michael and Vincent Price. You'll also hear the never-before-released second verse of Vincent's rap, written by Rod

Okay, tape's rolling. Any--anytime you want

Hi, this is Michael Jackson
This is Vincent Price
Michael Jackson is...
The Thriller!

*Vincent laughs*
Do we both say it?
Say it together?
"Inviting you to."
I say "inviting you to"? All right. Yeah
Okay
Any time. Tape's rolling

Hi, this is Michael Jackson
And this is Vincent Price, inviting you to...
The Thriller!

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize your neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The demons squeal in sheer delight
It's you they spy, so plump, so right
For though the groove is hard to beat
Yet still you stand with frozen feet
You try to run, you try to scream
But no more sun you'll ever see
For evil reaches from the crypt
To crush you in its icy grip

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40,000 years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the Thriller

Can you dig it?
Hmmm-Hahahahaha...
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Ahahahahahahah...

Hmmph, that's great fun!
Great, thank you. Cut
Okay. All right!

Don't wanna lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet, my heart is sayin', "Come and do me"

Now, we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come

Nobody ever showed her 'bout us (Oh, ba-da)
No one's sleepin' (No one's love)
Nobody should be grievin' this way (Aaow!)

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled your knife
She should have spied down his skin
Now, it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away? (Aaow!)
Doo-doo-do-do-doo
Hee-hee-hee-hee! (Hoo!)

Ooh, don't walk away
Walk away

Don't walk away
See, I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray?

How can I stop losing you?
How can I begin to say
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long, now, all I do is cry
Can’t we find some love to take this away?
'Cause the pain gets stronger every day

How can I begin again?
How am I to understand
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah

See, and why
All my dreams been broken
I don't know where we’re going
With everything we said and all we done now
Don't let go, I don't wanna walk away
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
And why?
All my dreams been broken
I don’t know where we’re going
When everything begins to set us free
Can't you see? I don't wanna walk away

If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Please don't go)
Can't you see that you will always be? (You will always be)
Even though I had to let you go (Don't you leave me, don't you leave me)
There’s nothing left to do
Don't walk away
If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Please, please don't leave, you will always)
Can't you see that you will always be? (Can't you see you and me?)
Even though (You will always be), I had to let you go
Better leave now, don't you leave me
When there's nothin' left to do
Don't walk away
If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Oh, no, oh, yeah, baby girl)
Can't you see? (You and me), that you will always be (I won't forget you, girl, I won't forget you, girl)
Even though (I won't forget you, girl), I had to let go
Better leave now, better leave now
There's nothin' left do
Don't walk away

Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
But baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
And for this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere just as long as you were there

And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

Oh, and on these quiet days
Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say

And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I need you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
(That's for all time)

Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you'll never go, that's for all time

She's from a world of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime, little children laughing
I'm from a world of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking, she kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh

I lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who ran away (Ooh)

I was the clown and she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work, but we took our chances
What I can't recall is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember all of those faces
And now, all I have is memories, oh-woah

I lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart on the carousel (Ooh)
To a circus girl who ran away

Two different people in love for an instant
They say that the circus came today
Sometimes, I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me

Don't you know?

I lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who ran away (I lost my heart)
I lost my heart (I lost) on the carousel (I lost my girl)
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart (Lost my heart) on the carousel (Lost my girl)
To a circus girl who ran away

(I lost)
Lost my heart (I lost my girl) on the carousel (Ooh)
To a circus girl (Oh, Lord, oh, lost, I lost her)
(I lost my heart) Lost my heart on the carousel

Uh huh, alright...

This time going to do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side, hold on
Shelter, come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold, I need someone
Oh, why oh, why, why, why...

One more chance at love

Searching for that one who's going to make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold, hold on
Lightning about to strike and rain only on me
Hurt so bad, sometimes, it's hard to breathe
Oh, why, why
(If you see her)
Tell her this from me
All I need is...

And I don't care what it takes, no, why
I'd sail the seven seas to be near her
And if you happen to see her
See, tell her this from me

One more chance at love

Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light
From one more violent crime

She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die
Did God say that you could decide?
You saw he didn't run
And that my daddy had no gun

In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand
He's awaken, ground is shakin'
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain

He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace, why is there war?
Did God say that they could decide
Who would live and who would die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids
We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice
Only God should decide
Who would live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done
If we raise our voice as one

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from you, baby
We can't take it
We've already had enough
(Deep in my soul baby)
Deep in your soul and let God decide
(Deep in my soul)
It's up to me and I am still alive
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
It's going down baby
(Just let God decide)
It's going on baby
(Just let God decide)
Deep in my soul baby
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough

You're my lover
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me, in the dark from me
As my brother, it's too much from me
As my brother, baby
As my lover
We've already had enough (Aaow!)

Oh lord, oh lord
Deep in my soul, babe
Oh no
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
Please don't let it
Oh no, oh no
Why did you do it?
Oh, don't do it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Please don't do it
Why did you do it?

Tu voz me llama, tú eres quien gana en mi corazón
Porque me has dado algo sagrado con tu pasión
Me conoces bien y sabes también, que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Y cuando no estás no hay felicidad, mi vida no es vida si tú te vas

Todo mi amor eres tú, todo mi amor eres tú
Cuando no estás no hay quien me dé lo que das tú
Pues todo mi amor eres tú

Noche de estrellas, haz que me quiera como a ella yo
De madrugada, ven que te espera todo mi amor
Soy joven, lo sé, pero siento que te quiero y sólo vivo por ti
Me conoces bien y sabes también, que yo no puedo vivir sin tu amor

Todo mi amor eres tú, todo mi amor eres tú

Cuando no estás no hay quien me dé lo que das tú

All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

I've lived my life the lonely
A soul that cries of shame
With handicapped emotions
Save me now from what still remains

I'll be your story hero
I'll serenade in rhyme
I'm just needing that someone
Save me now from the path I'm on

Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

When you say we will dance 'til the light of day
It's just like the children running with joy
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay
It's because I'm needing that someone

Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Love

[Song 117: Free]
24 ContributorsFree Lyrics
You're the one that I adore, you
Give me one and don’t adore me
Tell me things you all believe I do
All the things I wanna say and
Tell the things you are to me and
All the lies you have to say I do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
Yesterday was when I felt down
And you came with my stuff and put fate on the ground
And you have to say that you looked at me
Obviously, I do
That's why I want to be

Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine

You're the one that I adore
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you
Feel the vibe that I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Yesterday was when I felt down
I start tryin' to make you think that I was around
You know, life was just a thing, she don't pass the way I do
Because I want to be

Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine
Babe, alright
Ahh, ahh
Oh, yeah

Yesterday was when I felt down
I start tryin' to make sense like I was around
And was tryin' to make the way to see, what a thing I do
You know 'cause I want to be

Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind, babe
(Free like the wind blows)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(Wherever I go)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(And I'll take my time, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind
(Free like the wind)
To fly away just like a sparrow (Ooh, my, my, mine)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go)
Free, free like the wind blows
(You'll be free, now)
(I want to be free)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(I just want to be free)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(I want to be free) (Ah, ah, uh, oh baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go - ooh!)
I've got to be free, free, free, free
Ronnie, you are so silly!

There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And often be your friend
There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And often be your end

She told me she was givin' me
A life-time love forever true
But she left me for another man
And I’m singin' to keep from feelin' blue

All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh, Lord)
Tschada dada dada naa
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on, set me free
(Set me free)

There I am, so all alone
And I'm so sad and lonely
Tell me, what will I do
I can’t reveal, I’m holdin' on
I want you still to love me
I feel I am your fool

They told me you should sing a song
Of happy when you're feelin' blue
I been singin' for so very long
Still cryin', tell me, what should I do

All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh, Lord)
Tschada dada dada naa
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on, set me free
(Set me free)


She told me she'd be givin' me
A life-time love so guaranteed (Guaranteed)
But she left me for another man
And I’m singin', cryin' helplessly
But I’ll keep singin'

Tschada dada dada naa (Oh, my, my)

You know I always will love you, I am forever

I was the only one around (The only one)
When things would hurt you

Wasn't it I who said that you are free (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When living seemed so hard to be
And things would hurt you?

I am forever (I am forever)

[Song 124: All in Your Name]
16 ContributorsAll in Your Name Lyrics
Now I got a mission
The story unfolds
What the wise men have told you, is already known
That a woman and a man
Should go by the plan
And we find out, how high we can fly
There's just one religion
One family of love
We suffer the children
As God cries above
And the giving, not the taking
With hearts open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And what of our world
What does it become
When the damage is done?
And you held out, you said no, you stand up

Only God knows
That it’s all in the game
It’s all in Your Name
Carry me to the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
It's all in Your Name

Look to Heaven
An Angel appears
To love and protect us
Through all of our tears
And the gateway to peace
It stands open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And where is the peace
We're searching for
Under the shadows of war?
Can we hold out, and stand up, and say no?

Only God knows
That it's all in the game (Oh)
It's all in Your Name (Oh yeah)
Follow me to the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
It's all in Your Name

Say the word and I'll be there
To love you, and understand you
Meet the line on, and understand 
Will they all know  (It's over)
Then we'll all know  (It's over)
See? that it's done  (And it's all in Your Name)

It's all in the game
It's all in Your Name
Follow me through the Gates of Paradise
They're the same (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
It's all in the game
It's all in Your Name
Follow me through the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
They're the same (yeah-yeah)

It's all in the game

Follow me through the Gates of Paradise

I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

I never would have thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
And when I held her near
She would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (Look who's lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (Holdin' her to blame)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Holdin' her to blame)
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me but she was still your wife (Holdin' her to blame)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

All alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you, never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart, you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars, I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you

Thank you

Promise me, we'll always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky

Oh, I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me


Though you are gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I will remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky

Oh, I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see

[Song 129: Shout]
19 ContributorsShout Lyrics
This is not your ordinary record
Record, Re-re-record, re-re-re-cor-cor-cord (Hit it!)

Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things?
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's runnin' it
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killin' me
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page
Livin' encased like animals and cannibals
Eatin' each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Peace of mind's so hard to find

I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now

Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're livin'
The clock is tickin', the end is comin', there'll be no warnin'
But we live to see the dawn

How can we preach, when all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds?
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine

We're disconnected from love, we're disrespectin' each other
Whatever happened to protectin' each other?
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted
Family values are contradicted, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
The pressure is buildin' and I've had enough

I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now

Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn

I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout

Blue, blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue

I took my baby on a riverboat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited 'bout the way that things could've been
She said that I don't care
I wore a face no one could recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of takin' pictures, autographs, then they grabbed
My joy had turned to pain

My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm drownin' my pain, don't be feelin' no pain

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' no pain
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain

I am a cover of a magazine, what a scene
They know my every news
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine"
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you want to take a ride, look behind
Someone is followin' you
You try to get away, you turn real fast, but too bad
They know your every move

My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame (Oh, no)
And I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm feelin' all this pain, don't you ever complain

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' no pain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
Father never lies (Price of fame)
My father never lies
My father never lies (Price of fame)
So don't be feelin' this way, boy

Blue, blue, blue, blue (Hee hee, aouw!)
Blue, blue, blue, blue (Do-do-do-do-do!) (Aouw!)
Blue, blue, blue, blue (Ooh!)

I'd like to take some time and get away, then they say
"Is that boy still alive?"
The weak, they'd really start to take the pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive

My father always told me
"You won't live the quiet life"
They start wonderin' where have you been? (Oh, no)
I feel the envious look at me
What mistaken jealousy (Oh, lord)
Then, stand here in my shoes
And get a taste of my blues

It’s the price of fame (Hee hee!)
You pay the price for fame (Hee hee!)
So don't you ever complain (Ooh!)
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' this way
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
My father never lies (Price of fame)
My father never lies, baby (Hee hee!)
My father never lies (Price of fame) (Hee hee, hee hee!)
So don't be feelin' no pain, boy (Aouw!)

[Song 131: Hot Street]
20 ContributorsHot Street Lyrics
(A hot) Stone shaker is looking fine
She is a heart-breaker every time
She never seems to realize
That someday she will be crying too (Ooh!)
(She is) A sharpshooter that is moving fast
A slight cruiser loaded with gas
Slowing down to make a pass
You think it is going to hit
So why not take a chance?

Because this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street, yeah (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street (Ooh!)

(She is) A streetwalker when there is time to spare
She got that big spenders holding their share
A heart of gold, but no one cares (No one seems to care)
Within their eyes
Some young lovers are laughing loud
And there are some old suckers trying to get down
The evening spins around and round (Spins around and round)
Yes, people of the night smoking through the dark

'Cause this is Hot Street, ooh! (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
Yeah, this is Hot Street, no (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street (Ooh!)

(All night mover) Just trying to put a little fun in their lives
(Winners, losers) You see them standing on the corner in the neon light (Aoww!)
Tonight
(Ooh!)
Yeah, yeah, ooh
(Ooh!)

Some feeling you cannot explain
It is such a hard feeling lying in bed's flame
The evening starts to fall again (Starts to fall again)
It is time to come alive
So why not take a chance?

'Cause this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street, oh (Ready or not)
And the fantasy will never stop
'Cause this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)
And the fantasy will never stop

Burning it up
Fun on the run
Ready or not
Fantasy will never stop
Burning it up
Fun on the run
Ready or not
Fantasy will never stop
Burning it up
Fun on the run
Ready or not
Fantasy will never stop

Hoo!
Hee!

All alone, she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doin' wrong
On the move, got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth, you are on the loose
You're livin' on sunset time (You're livin' on sunset time)
(Hoo!)
Feelin' bad, you're livin' much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw, they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth, you're breakin' every law

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Morning rider, you're a Saturday nighter (Ow)

On the go, got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
Livin' hot, doin' what you should not
The break's on me then what do you get
We're livin' on sunset time (We're livin' on sunset time)
(Want that dime)
Shoot the breeze, you feel that she's the tease
Your night is free, what you want to be?
Who's to trust when livin' dangerous?
Tonight's your night, but this is what you lose

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Gettin' higher, you're a Saturday nighter (Ow)
(Hoo!)
(Pah-dah-da-da-dah-dah-dah)

You are there when the night's in town
Standin' there with the top of the round
They don't care about the things you used to say
You're like the cinema, you think there's nothin' wrong (Hoo!)

Goin' town, you do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the move, got fever in your shoes
The night's on you, what are you gonna do?

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Got to reach that driver, you're a Saturday nighter (Ow)

We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others

In your mind, you will find
A world of sweet harmony

Birds of a feather, we'll fly together
Now, music, music and me

Chicago, Chicago, Chicago!
Chicago

It was Chicago 1945
Cubs lost that year, but Al Capone was found alive
They searched forty days, in the suburbs of the night
But they found him, alive
Alive
Young Joe DiMaggio hit his first home run
People gathered 'round, basking in the sun
Three girls disappeared, on a cold windy night

Never to be found again, never to be found again, so

Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
You can’t hide the truth, so won’t you turn on the light?
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
Never to be found again, never to be found again
Found again, never to be found again
Found again (Found again)

It was so windy, joy had to be in the air (Hee hee)
People gather ‘round to see the world's fair
It was so happy, but sad in the truth
So much is goin’ on
They didn’t know the girls were missing, missing
You can’t choose what they say, and nobody can (Hee hee)
Because on the of the Chicago Tribune, feature the world's fair
Girl, didn't bother, you know it is the truth (Hoo hoo)

Never to be found again, never to be found again, so

Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
You can’t hide the truth, so won’t you turn on the light?
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
Never to be found again, never to be found again
Be found again, never to be found again

Found again (Found again, hoo hoo!)
Never to be found again (Hoo hoo, Found again)
You can’t hide anything (Hee hee, found again)

You can’t find anything (Found again)

It was Chicago 1945, Cubs lost that year
But Al Capone was found alive
Searched forty days, in the suburbs of the night
So much was goin’ on
They didn’t know the girls were missing, missing
Can’t choose what they say, nobody can
'Cause on the cover of the Chicago Tribune
Feature the world’s fair (Hoo hoo)
They didn't bother, though it is the scene

Never to be found again, never to be found again, so (Hoo hoo, hee hee)

Everybody is doing it to somebody's love
In sight of me
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

Somebody is up, somebody is down

My mouth might let it be
So don't you monkey shine with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh lord) (Hoo) (Hoo-hoo)
I caught your mother she doing a dude
You can't like it that we're looking right at you

Je ferme les yeux, je me sens fiévreux, sans toi j'ai froid
J'aimerais t'appeler, j'aimerais prononcer, que toi, que toi
Ce que je ressens, personne ne comprend, je me sens si bien de t'aimer
Pour la première fois, je sais que c'est toi, j'ai besoin de rêver, je vais t'emmener
L'été finira, près du feu de bois, on fera l'amour
Blottie contre toi, je te dirai tout bas, tu me rends folle
Ce que je ressens, personne ne comprend, je me sens si bien près de toi
J'en perds ma fierté, je ne veux plus tricher, la vérité pour moi, c'est la vie avec toi

Je ne veux pas la fin de nous, je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Et si ça stoppe, je crois que je deviendrais fou
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous

Et dans cet univers, sans toi c'est un enfer, ne t'en vas pas
Et pouvoir t'embrasser, j'en tremble rien que d'y penser, tout te donner
Les femmes d'avant toi, ne comptent même pas, j'ai oublié tout ton passé (Passé)
La terre peut trembler, la guerre éclater
Je supporterai tout, écoute-moi mon amour

Je ne veux pas la fin de nous, je ne veux pas la fin de nous
(Oh, oh, and it feels)
Et si ça stoppe, je crois que je deviendrais fou
(Uh-huh)
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous

Notre amour brillera dans ce monde
Il m'a vraiment tout apporté
Donne-moi ton corps et ton âme
Pour te dire amour, toujours, je veux te garder

Je ne veux pas la fin de nous, je ne veux pas la fin de nous

[Song 141: Throwing Your Life Away]
15 ContributorsThrowing Your Life Away Lyrics
Chop, hah!

I was strong enough to fight
I was never wrong but always right, dah
Bring it on me
I was trying to crack the code
But now I’m gonna lay a revelation
Dah, bring it on me
I was playing the underdog
I got my kicks but I got no home
Bring it on me
Life was sweet and life was bad
Got my time while I'm doin' that
Bring it on me

Now I must fight
There’s no love in my life

Don’t be throwing your life away
Throwing your life away (Oh!)
Don’t you find it so easy to just say no? (To just say no?)

I was livin' high and low
I got my kicks and I got my soul
Bring it on me
I was doing the underdog
I got my kicks but I got no home
Bring it on me
I was really doing bad
I got my time and I got my past
Dah, bring it on me
I was living in the right
I got my time without a sound
Dah, bring it on me

Now I must fight
There’s no love in my life

Don’t be throwing your life away
Throwing your life away (Oh!)
Don’t you find it so easy to just say no? (To just say no?)
Throwing your life away
Throwing your life away (Oh!)
Don’t you find it so easy to just say no? (To just say no?)
Da-da na-da da-da-da

Release me
Someone say "Release me"
Someone say "Release me"
Someone say "Release me"
I've been through a fire
Dah, I've been through a lot (Chop)

Throwing your life away
Throwing your life away (Oh!)
I love you
Hee!

Don’t you find it so easy to just say no?
To just say no?

She was there, just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered, "No" to me
Well, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered, "No" to me
Well, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

Take away this never-ending sorrow
Take this lonely feelin' from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would fill with gold
Da-da-da-da-da-da

I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
The day that she'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon, ooh-ooh

Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
