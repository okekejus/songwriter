[Song 1: Most People Are Good]
22 ContributorsMost People Are Good Lyrics
I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good

Hey girl
Go on now
You know you've got everybody lookin'

I got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the toolbox, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
The DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me, girl, aww

Country girl, shake it for me, girl
Shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me, girl
Shake it for me, girl, shake it for me

Somebody's sweet little farmer's child
With a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big 'ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me, girl

Country girl, shake it for me, girl
Shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me, girl
Shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
Guitar


Now dance like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines, yeah
Move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby, you know what to do

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me, girl, aww

Country girl, shake it for me, girl
Shake it for me, girl, shake it for me (Oh, country girl)
Country girl, shake it for me, girl
Shake it for me, girl, shake it for me

23 ContributorsRain is a Good Thing LyricsLuke Bryan’s first Country #1. The song is about H20, and with it Bryan, a Leesburg, Georgia native, splashed out the July 2010 Billboard chart’s previous top spot, Brad Paisley’s “Water.”
My daddy spent his life lookin' up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, sayin', "Son, it's way too dry"
It clouds up in the city, the weatherman complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies piled up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Ain't nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Wringing out our soakin' clothes, ridin' out a thunderstorm
When the tin roof gets to talkin', that's the best love we make
Yeah, where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies piled up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up yo pants
Country girls, they want to cuddle
Kids out playin' in a big mud puddle

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby— Hahahaha
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies piled up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing

Uh, uh

I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35's, pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl, hand me another beer, yeah

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night

Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country-rock, hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night
Yeah, that’s my kind of night

My kinda-- your kind-- is this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh oh oh oh oh, gonna get our love on
Oh oh oh oh oh, time to get our buzz on

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right

11 ContributorsWhat She Wants Tonight Lyrics
She walks up, velvet rope unhooks
She snaps her fingers and a drink comes
She locks you down with just one look
She's got this whole club undone
If she's on the rebound, you ain't gonna know it
Coming off a heartbreak, she ain't gonna show it
She's eyes caught, red dot, locked on me, yeah

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight

I get to catch all her secrets
Sequins bouncing off flashing lights
If she wants it, then we're leaving
Get me home, park the truck, cut the tires
I get to be where she goes when she's lonely
The last door of the night she's closing
Oh, I know she could have anything, but

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight

And I don't know how I got to be
The only thing she needs right now, uh

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight (Tonight), yeah
I get to be what she wants tonight, tonight

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', "no way, she ain't got one"
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, "Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "Come here, boy, I wanna dance"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"

I'da gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool; AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, "Oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is"
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"

The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

She was like, "Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"

Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again

Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Let's whisper, let's don't talk
Baby, leave my t-shirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we'll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It's time we made it happen

Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down

I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain’t holdin’ nothin’, these two hands
Until they’re holding you again

Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

I don’t wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So let's close our eyes

And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found

Strip it down, down, down

I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It don’t leave my sight since we had that fight
Can’t remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it

I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up

Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures
I’m on your clock, you’re in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up

I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed
And I don’t get no rest
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, light it up

Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drives in a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm-mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

If you ain't a 10, you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God almighty

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm-mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm-mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Yeah, I'm a little drunk on you

When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

So long my friend
'till we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to...

Sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer, yeah

All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)

Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (c'mon)

Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did (kick it)

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now

Fill your cup up

Through the dirt and the gravel
Through the years and the miles
Every road that you traveled
Through the tears and the smiles
Through the clear and the muddy
Through the thick and thin
The quiet nights, the howling wind
Through the good and the ugly
The blue and the black
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back

Through all of the words
The mean and the kind
Through the strings that unravel
And the ties that bind
From the crazy and the different
To the more of the same
From the coast is clear
To a hurricane
Yeah, I'll be right beside you
On a roll or off the tracks
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
To the moon and back

Through the bitter and the sweet
The cold and the fire
Lonely cotton sheets
And the burning desire
Until our song is over
Til the stars all fade to black
I'm gonna love you
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
Yeah, I'm gonna love you
All the way to the moon and back
To the moon and back

If I could make a livin' from walkin' in the woods
You can bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill lookin' at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off of turning 'em bass
Never worry 'bout the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in

Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

I get a little Farm Pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pullin' the string on a nine point nine two-stroke, Mercury
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat, and she's ready to go

And we get to huntin', fishin', lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich, and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day, yeah
Woo

So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here, knee-deep, in the Muckalee (Ha)
Huntin' and fishin', lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
Let's go there in our mind

Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the mornin', dark whiskey in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day (Woo)
Come on

Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day, yeah

Everybody here ain't from here
But we're here doin' our thing
Lettin' go a little, little by little
Sippin' on a frozen drink

Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
"Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Buffett song?"
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
"Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Marley song?"
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

We'll be gone

Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, feelin' no pain
It goes like

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

Fast
That's the kind of car you wanna drive when you're sixteen
Fast
That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

Fast
That's what your parents said when we were falling in love
It's too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause, I would somehow
But it don't work like that

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast

Oh
Oh

What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl, what you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink
So make it seven on seven
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling out the top

And we'll go shot for shot for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex
And send 'em both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

Slow country from a cover band
I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want, we could grab a cab
Girl, we got all night, I got a bottomless tab

So let's go shot for shot for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex
And send 'em both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

It feels too good to let it end right here
I ain't going home alone tonight
So let's not let it end, let it end right here
Girl, you're going home with me tonight

So let's go shot for shot for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
Put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex
And send 'em both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

No, I ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight
Baby, don't let me go home alone
Home alone tonight

[Song 17: Knockin’ Boots]
15 ContributorsKnockin’ Boots Lyrics
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me 'cross town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth

Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
"Fishin' in the Dark" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, me and you, oh

Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
"Fishin' in the Dark" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, girl, me and you

Doors need shuttin'
Lights need cuttin'
Lips need lockin'
Boots need knockin'

And birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
"Fishin' in the Dark" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Mmm, knockin' boots, me and you, oh
Knockin' boots

[Song 18: Build Me a Daddy]
7 ContributorsBuild Me a Daddy Lyrics
A boy walks past a window of a glowin' open sign
Full of wooden toys and trucks and painted trains
Rings a bell up on the counter, hands a picture to the man
Of a kid beside a soldier smiling away
Said, "Sir, I've heard you can build anything"

Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a southern drawl
And a crooked smile if you can
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make mama happy
If you could build me a daddy

There's an old Winchester rifle, back home hangin' on the wall
He promised me he'd teach me how to aim
And he said when I got older, we could work on that curveball
I know he'd never wanna miss a game
So here's a little money that I've saved

Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a southern drawl
And a crooked smile if you can
I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make mama happy
If you could build me a daddy

Give him a big heart, make his arms wide open
I know he misses me, so mister, I was hopin'

You could build me a daddy
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a southern drawl
And a fishing pole in his hand
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back?
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make my mama happy
If you could you build me a daddy

Could you build me a daddy?

[Song 19: Do I]
18 ContributorsDo I Lyrics“Do I” is a song by Luke Bryan, released as the lead single from his album, Doin' My Thing.
Lyrically, “Do I” chronicles a couple questioning the state of their relationship.
Baby, what are we becomin'?
It feels just like we're always runnin'
Rollin' through the motions every day

I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way

What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wantin' you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby?
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?

Remember when we didn't have nothin'
But a perfect simple kind of lovin'?
Baby, those sure were the days

There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now I'm second guessin' everything I see

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wantin' you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I

Still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep?
Baby, do I?!

Whoa! Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wantin' you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Tell me, baby, do I get one more try?
Do I?
Baby, do I?

20 ContributorsI Don’t Want This Night to End Lyrics
Girl, I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pullin' me in
Like the moon on your skin
I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
And get out of town

Got the stars comin' out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

You got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

Gonna cuss the mornin' when it comes
'Cause I know that the risin' sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you'll have to leave
Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
There's plenty of gas, and the night's still alive

You got your hands up
You’re rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end


You got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

I don't want this night to end
No, I don’t want this night to end

24 ContributorsCrash My Party Lyrics“Crash My Party” is the titular track and first single from Luke Bryan’s fourth studio album.
It don't matter what plans I got, I can break 'em
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don't mind tellin' all the guys I can't meet 'em
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night
Girl, I don't care, oh, I just gotta see what you're wearin'
Your hair, is it pulled up or fallin' down?
Oh, I just have to see it now

If you wanna call me, call me, call me (Call me, call me, call me)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby, that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing (Drop everything)
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked; I'll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

Ain't a spot downtown that's rockin' the way that you rock me
Ain't a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And I'm gone so long, hang on
I'll meet you in a minute or two

If you wanna call me, call me, call me (Call me, call me, call me)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby, that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing (Drop everything)
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked; I'll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

If it's two in the mornin' and you're feelin' lonely
And wonderin' what I'm doing

Go ahead and call me, call me, call me (Call me, call me, call me)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing (Drop everything)
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked; I'll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime
(Call me, call me, call me)

[Song 22: What Makes You Country]
13 ContributorsWhat Makes You Country Lyrics
People talkin' ’bout what is and what ain’t country
What gives ’em the right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth

You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out

I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

You do your kind of country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country

[Song 23: Sunrise, Sunburn, Sunset]
9 ContributorsSunrise, Sunburn, Sunset Lyrics
Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little PacSun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ayy

I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

10 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolLove You, Miss You, Mean It Lyrics
We were small-town meant to be
My momma loved her, her daddy loved me
We burned up the road between her house and mine
We'd kiss in her driveway
And by the time I hit the highway
She called to tell me goodnight one more time

And she'd say, "Love you, miss you, mean it
Boy, I'll see you when I'm dreamin'
I can't wait to feel you hold me again
Till then, I'll be countin' down the minutes
I'll be climbin' up these walls
Your kiss, I want it, need it
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby"

When graduation came
UGA was callin' her name
We thought two hundred miles wasn't nothin' we couldn't get through
But after that first fall
The time got longer between the calls
And I couldn't help but wonder what happened to

My little love you, miss you, mean it
Girl, I'll see you when I'm dreamin'
I can't wait to feel you hold me again
Till then I'll be countin' down the minutes
I'll be climbin' up these walls
Your kiss, I want it, need it
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby, yeah
(Woo, uh)

Years went by, pages got turned
But I never did forget about her
Late one night, out of the blue
My phone lit up and my heart did too

She said, "I don't know about you
But I love you, miss you, meant it
I still see you when I'm dreamin'
I just wanna feel you hold me again
And I've been countin' down the minutes
I'll keep climbin' up these walls
Your kiss, I want it, need it
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby"

(Love you, miss you, mean it)
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby
(Love you, miss you, mean it)
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby

All we do right is make love
And we both know now that ain’t enough

Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Baby who we are just didn’t work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt

Ain’t gonna beg you to stay

She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done

And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back

We spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her

When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster
Like that old beach roller coaster

[Song 27: Good Directions]
5 ContributorsGood Directions Lyrics
I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flat-bed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking this is where rednecks come from
She had "Hollywood" written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions and I was the man for the job

I told her, "Way up yonder past the caution lights
There's a little country store with an old coke sign
You gotta stop and ask "Miss" Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me"

I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat and thought, "You fool, it could have been love"
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

I told her, "Way up yonder past the caution lights
There's a little country store with an old coke sign
You gotta stop and ask "Miss" Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me"

Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me
Or am I really seeing what I think I see
The woman of my dreams coming back to me
(Yeah)

She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Momma gave her a big ole glass
And sent her right back here to me
Thank God for good directions and turnip greens

S'posed to make a country boy sad
I should be in my recliner, whiskey typin' up one-liners
Cryin', trying to get you back
Yeah, I know how that country song goes
I'm supposed to be heartbroke

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high
I ain't got a give in my damn right, I can do this all night
Country done came to town, this town don't stand a chance
I'll holler at the ladies, dancin' like crazy, new Luccheses, fresh up out the deer stand
Feelin' this high, wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't even gonna try
But I got a beer in my hand (Yeah)

The bands playin' David Lee Murphy
Party Crowd, it's party-thirty
Lawdy mercy, I'm feelin' good
And I'm bettin' you're bettin', that I'm a wreck and you reckon
I'll call you up any second, and I would

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high
I ain't got a give in my damn right, I can do this all night

I'll holler at the ladies, dancin' like crazy, new Luccheses, fresh up out the deer stand
Feelin' this high wasn't part of my plan

Oops, my bad
I meant to be blue

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high
I ain't got a give in my damn right, I'm gon' do this all night
Country done came to town, this town don't stand a chance
I'll holler at the ladies dancin' like crazy, new Luccheses, fresh up out the deer stand

Wasn't even gonna try

We were countin' one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishin' on 'em
I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far

Down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night

I was saying, "Stay with me
I'll be everything you need"

We were way past 1 AM

[Song 30: Move]
14 ContributorsMove Lyrics
Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Backed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you

M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move

It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you

M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
And I can't move when you move

Let me talk to you
M-O-V-E
I love it when you, love it when you feel the beat
C-O-M-E
Come on, I wanna see you

Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ playing throwback tunes
I wanna move when you
But I can't move when you
No, I can't move when you move
No, I can't move when you move

[Song 31: Jesus ’Bout My Kids]
8 ContributorsJesus ’Bout My Kids Lyrics
I used to talk to my kids about Jesus
The same way that my mom and daddy did
I used to talk to my kids about Jesus
Now I talk to Jesus 'bout my kids

When they're born, you dive right in
Tryin' like hell to get 'em born again
Pull out them Bible stories, then you stumble your way through
You do your best to steer 'em straight
Tell 'em 'bout who He is and ain't
And answer all their questions even though you've got some too

I used to talk to my kids about Jesus
How He lived and died and rose again
I used to talk to my kids about Jesus
Now I talk to Jesus 'bout my kids

You lose your grip the more they grow
They won't listen 'cause they think they know
And you watch 'em goin' down a dead-end road, and you can't stop 'em
Lord, please watch 'em

I used to talk to my kids about Jesus
Pray they'd find Him sooner than I did
I used to talk to my kids about Jesus
Now I talk to Jesus 'bout my kids

Guide 'em as they go
'Cause if anyone does, You know
Along the straight and narrow
All the places they could fall

I used to talk to my kids about Jesus
He knew and loved 'em long before I did
I used to talk to my kids about Jesus
Now I talk to Jesus 'bout my kids
I used to talk to my kids about Jesus
Now I talk to Jesus 'bout my kids

Hey, farmboy, keep droppin' that plow
Bailin' that hay, feedin' them cows
From the rooster crow 'til another long day is gone
Country on
Hey big rig, keep clockin' them miles
Pullin' that horn, makin' us smile
Rollin' that load down the road all night long

Eatin' that dirt, wearing that gold
Break a leg rodeo, but just don't break no bones

Hey barkeep, how 'bout another round?
Keep the neon lit in this crazy town
Just pour a little more

[Song 33: Muckalee Creek Water]
11 ContributorsMuckalee Creek Water LyricsMuckalee Creek means ‘home’ for Luke Bryan. Muckalee Creek, (part of the Flint River) and the 32 bridge area have influenced many references throughout Luke’s music catalog.
“Down where I was born was Heaven… Read More 
It flows underneath the 32 bridge
And cuts through the heart of South Georgia
Big copperheads and mean wild pigs
And gators in the weeds waiting for ya
I leave my phone in the truck
I leave my truck at the road
My four-wheeler gets me where I wanna go
I leave the world behind
I pull my hat down low
Get back to my roots, by a full moon glow

I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek water

Daddy brought me down here when I was a kid
Taught me how to bait a craw fish basket
From the time I was old enough to walk
He had me running down squirrels and rabbits
I feel right at home in this neck of the woods
If this was all I had, I'd be living good
So let the stock market do what it's gonna do
Let the dollar go down and gas over the roof

I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek water

I'm free, and I'm me
Being everything that I wanna be
Nobody jacking with me
No sign of the city lights
Hell with the city lights!

I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even holler
When I get down deep in that Muckalee Creek water

That Muckalee Creek water

I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan

My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around

And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I found my billfold
I cried oh no no
Good time Charlie got me now I'm broke
But it was worth acting like a fool
Yeah girl I must have really showed you

Cause all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in

Working the crowd pouring out my heart

5 ContributorsOut of Nowhere Girl Lyrics
It's just a regular Saturday night in the summer
Same guys and girls and the same stars way up in the sky
It's like the music stopped playing when I saw your body
Did you come here with someone or come here to party tonight?

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
My out of nowhere girl

Girl are you lost? Are you just here in town for the weekend
All of my life I've been here, never seen you before
If you need someone to show you around, girl I got you
I gotta know you and hold you
I don't wanna leave here alone anymore

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We could go anywhere you want
Baby I got you
You know I got you
When you walked in this place, you turned it up
Right when I saw you
Baby I saw you

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl

11 ContributorsI See You Lyrics
Roll in the bar, me and my crew
Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookin’ me up, yeah
Buyin’ me drinks with a thousand girls
There's just one thing
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you

Don't know what you did, but you done it good
You don't know how bad that I wish I could
Delete you from my phone, find a girl and take her home
But there's just one thing wrong

I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you

Your lips, your eyes
Girl, since you told me goodbye

I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you

Baby, I see you

[Song 37: Someone Else Calling You Baby]
13 ContributorsSomeone Else Calling You Baby Lyrics
I saw a truck backing out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messing with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over cause I couldn’t believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whispering
A tear in your eye says I should have been listening

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I aren’t leaving till I hear you say what’s going on
It’ll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I’m gone

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

No goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
No, don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Is someone else calling you baby?

6 ContributorsHungover in a Hotel Room Lyrics
Hungover in a hotel room
Cell phone's dead
You're stretched out next to me
Lost somewhere in a dark whiskey dream
Hungover in a hotel room
Call the concierge
Two bloody mary's and some cigarettes
So you can wake up to breakfast in bed
Hear your voice in my head

Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out

Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room

Slide the curtains back
Light up the morning on the balcony
Look at you stirring in the shadows and sheets
Last night on repeat

Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out

Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room

There's that smile driving me wild
Call the front desk, late check out request
You know, better yet, book it for another night

Room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room

Oh, hungover in a hotel room
Yeah, yeah
Hungover in a hotel room

It's like the sun went down just to frame your face
Like they played that song just to see you sway
Like that old surf shop had you in mind
With what you got on, makin' those tan lines
It's like the ocean knows we're layin'
On this beach tonight
It's like the sand's been waitin'
For you to come alive 'cause

You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lightin' this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull mе closer
Kiss by kiss, one after anothеr
Don't let it go, baby, let this summer
Just keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves
Keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves

Wish I could bottle up the taste on your lips
That margarita saltwater sunburned sip
It's like I feel that sun right next to me
Yeah, girl, your touch is a hundred degrees
Boardwalks were made for dancin'
And flip flops were made to lose like
This night was meant to happen
And, girl, I was made for you like

You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lightin' this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up

4 ContributorsLittle Boys Grow Up and Dogs Get Old Lyrics
Bandit was a black lab, Daddy brought home
He said, "Son he's yours from now on"
Bandit looked at me and he cocked his head
Slept at night on the foot of my bed
All that year, I can see him still
Chasing after me, nipping at my heels
Down to the bus stop, my new best friend
Still waiting right there when I got home again

And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
I guess I just didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

He was my sidekick through thick and thin
And he'd bark at my fish when I'd reel 'em in
Summers came and went and we grew like weeds
And I don't know if I raised him or he raised me

And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
How was I supposed to know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

He was fourteen when I left for Tennessee
And he came down the front porch steps a little slow
I got down to hug his neck
Said "you take care of Mom and Dad, 'til I get home"
"And be a good boy"
"Now you be a good boy"

And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
God I wish I didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

But baby, we ain't never been

When its tapping on the roof, ain't nothing like you
Doing what you do to me
When the lightning hits, I'll be kissing on your lips
Girl, the rest is history

Baby, we ain't never been

8 ContributorsHooked On It Lyrics
First time I tied a plastic worm and felt him on the other end
It was get the net, get him in the boat
Yeah buddy, I was hooked on it
First time I heard Chattahoochee on the speakers of my radio
I was topping off the tank on my old two-tone
I was hooked on it
Ha-ha!

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it

The first time I got that Gulf Coast white sugar sand on my feet
Saw the sunshine dancing on that clear blue water
I was hooked on it
First time I pulled me a long neck bottle from the bottom of a bucket of ice
As soon as that cold beer hit my lips, I was hooked on it

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Come on!

Like a Friday payday honky tonk buzz
I gotta have a little more of it just because
I keep coming back to the good stuff, 'cause I'm hooked on it

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life's all in my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Yeah, I'm hooked on it
I'm hooked on it

Up
Early in the mornin' wakin' that sun
Up
Fillin' that coffee, crankin' that tractor
Up
Prayin' it rains down on the devil's dust
Them rows come poppin'

Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow

Up
Rollin' 'round town in a hand me down old pickup
Pullin' in the driveway pickin' that pretty thang
Up
Just layin' low where heaven and a dirt road touch
Holdin' a cold one

Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow
Up

Up
On a Sunday pond bank tearin' that crank bait
Up
Livin' for a Friday, runnin' that scoreboard
Up
Keepin' that faith, waitin' on the day He calls us

Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow

5 ContributorsShe’s a Hot One Lyrics
Running kind of late, got her makeup half on
Touch it up good enough
Oh, whatever
All her girlfriends waiting outside on her
They've been blowing up her phone
Girl come on, get yourself together
Got her hands up, she's so ready with her driver on the way
Skips the damn line, she ain't even gotta pay

She starts feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one

She's dancing like every guy in here ain't watching her
Do her thang, make it rain
God to mighty
She's breaking necks, got them spilling beer
Putting that bartender through a year or two of Junior college
She's about to get them Dolce Vita's on the bar
It's all but all over the minute she starts

Feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one

Like the summer heat where she comes from
She's burning me down
Just look at her now
Just look at her now
(She's so hot)
(She's so hot)
(She's so hot)

She starts feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
Yeah, she might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one

[Song 47: Too Drunk to Drive]
5 ContributorsToo Drunk to Drive Lyrics
There ain't a liquor store, dive bar, or corner booth for twenty miles around
We ain't on a boat, on a lake, in the sun with the cooler loaded down
But suddenly, I'm feeling all impaired from the way you looked at me from over there
Rolling like I'm stoned past gone, looking in your eyes

Girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flying 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive

You can hide my keys, lock the door, maybe we can find something here to do
Maybe wreck some sheets, crash your lips into mine and not even make the news
These four walls are safer than them two lanes
You pour 'em tall when you start whispering my name
Ain't no blue light, line walkin' happening tonight

Girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flying 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
Yeah, I'm too drunk to drive

Yeah, girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flying 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
No, I ain't had a shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive (Woah)

I'm just too drunk to drive
I'm too drunk to drive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm too drunk to drive

[Song 48: Razor Blade]
7 ContributorsRazor Blade Lyrics
You're not looking for anything more than a
Good time and an open door
A good band and a dance floor
Then she walks in
You got a pickup line to throw, but
She walks up and says "hello"
Before you can even let it go
She's got you reeled in

You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into

You're blindfolded yo
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
You wait

You ain't used to playing by these rules
So you sit there and try to play it cool
Do your best not to play the fool
But it's too late now
You wanna see how far she'll let you go
She'll let you think you're in control

You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade

You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into

You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
Cut you like a razor blade
She cut you like a razor blade

Ain't no doors and no windows
Just a roll bar and a radio
If it rains you're gonna get wet
But that old 302 ain't let me down yet

It's a cutout picture of the 70's
When everything felt so free

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
My ol' Bronco

I flipped it over up on Arnold Hill
Turned it back over and fixed the grill
You know where I been by that old oil spot
Most times it's in the beach bar parking lot

No it ain't hard to pick me out
Cause it's the only one in this town

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No, I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco

Yeah it's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco

12 ContributorsDrinkin’ Beer and Wastin’ Bullets Lyrics
Out in the sticks and the squirrels and the ticks
And my 30-06, I'm running out of Miller Lite
Trucks in park, the dog won't bark
Couple hours till dark
Wishing one would walk by
Might as well left my gun in the gun rack
Been here all day
All I killed’s a twelve pack

Sitting here waiting on a deer, drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aiming at the empties, missing hitting pine trees
It aren’t my fault them cans keep moving
My baby's on the phone saying baby come home
Where you been and
What you've been doing
We'll I've been, sitting here, waiting on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets

The only deer I've seen been John Deere green
And that don't mean, that I got a raw deal
Cause aren’t no boss calling me horse
Ticking me off on the edge of this cornfield
On my second box of Winchester hundred grains
Aren’t seen a big buck but it's been a good day

Sitting here waiting on a deer, drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aiming at the empties, missing hitting pine trees
It aren’t my fault them cans keep moving
My baby's on the phone saying baby come home
Where you been and
What you've been doing
We'll I've been, sitting here, waiting on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Sitting here waiting on a deer, drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aiming at the empties, missing hitting pine trees
It aren’t my fault them cans keep moving
My baby's on the phone saying baby come home
Where you been and
What you've been doing
We'll I've been, sitting here, waiting on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets

Sitting here, waiting on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets

I watch you tell everyone
That she is your only one
But I see the other side
Know all the things you try to hide
Man, you put you up a real good front
You thinking you've got everyone
But you ain't got me fooled
I see right through

If you love her like you say you do
Then why don't you love her like you say you do
'Cause I wanna love her like you say you do
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that just ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do

Think you go as simple as you walk away
There ain't too much you even gotta say
You don't have to hurt her anymore
It's just a turnin' of a door
And don't you worry about bein' gone
'Cause she won't want for nothing too long
'Cause I see what you couldn't see
And I wanna be what you wouldn't be

If you love her like you say you do
Then why don't you love her like you say you do
'Cause I wanna love her like you say you do
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that just ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do

If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do
No, no, no
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do

I wanna love her, I wanna love her, I wanna love her
Like you say you do
I wanna love her, I wanna love her

[Song 52: Kill the Lights]
4 ContributorsKill the Lights Lyrics“Kill the Lights” is track #2 on Luke Bryan’s new album of the same name.  In this song, he is taking his girlfriend out in the country, up a back road, to kill the lights, as the title implies, and make out.
High beams, you and me
Little back road, barely see
Right song, radio
Throw it in low and drive slow
I saw you and it lit me up
A girl like you, it's just too much

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights


We can feel our way through
Let me just hold on to you
Baby trust my hands
Live it up while we still can and

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights

Don't it feel right
Until the sunrise
We can just go on what we know


Can't help but wanna want ya
You wanna do this don't ya
Come here, let me pull you closer
You reach over and

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights

Kill the lights
Baby you and me, kill the lights
Kill the lights

[Song 53: Little Less Broken]
4 ContributorsLittle Less Broken Lyrics
Of all the bars you could've walked your boots into
Why'd it have to be the one that I picked too?
I just wanted a place to sip my way through missin' you
You didn't see me when you walked past me
I wasn't ready to see you this happy

Looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it took you just a little less time
Looks like your heart's just a little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine (A little less broken than mine)

To Hell with killin' what's left of this Walker Black
'Cause I ain't lettin' you know that I hurt this bad
I'll just hang my head underneath this hat, and slip out the back
I'm dealin' with not being together
So are you but you're doin' it better

It looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it took you just a little less time
Looks like your heart's just a little less broken than mine

Maybe goodbye didn't hit you the way that it hit me
Guess hearts don't ever break fifty-fifty

Oh, 'cause it looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it's takin' me a little more time
'Cause baby, your heart's just a little less broken, a little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine (A little less broken than mine)

A little less broken than mine (Yeah, ayy)
A little less broken than mine (A little less broken than mine)
A little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine (A little less broken than mine)
A little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine

You got your sundress on for game day
Just to drink beer on an old tailgate
You were born and raised to be a southern belle
But in a place like this you like to raise a little hell
You got your year-round tan
You’re on the five year plan
You shake your little pom poms up in the stands

My my my little ADPi

You got that high school boyfriend you still think about
You know how to make him jealous when he comes into town
You drive your little love bug when you’re skipping class
And your sisters get you home when you’re drunk off your ass
You know how to be a lady
Yea you’re still your daddy’s baby
You drive the band and the boys and the bartenders crazy

[Song 55: For a Boat]
4 ContributorsFor a Boat Lyrics
Everything I learned about life
I learned out on that bank
From gettin' up early, comin' up empty
And good things come to those that wait
Money doesn't grow on trees
The difference in talking and shootin' the breeze

I remember thinkin', wouldn't it be cool
To have an old flat bottom and an Evinrude?
And Daddy saying, "Son, don't they bite just fine right here?"
He'd say, "Love what you got, buddy, not what you ain't"
And just about then that bobber would sink
And that outboard dream of mine would disappear
I grew up pretty lucky as far as lucky goes
Too broke for a boat

He could've picked up an extra shift
Or a weekend at the factory
But every Sunday was saved for Jesus
And Saturdays, he spent with me
'Til that summer would fall
I didn't know we had it all

I remember thinkin', wouldn't it be cool
To have an old flat bottom and an Evinrude?
And Daddy saying, "Son, don't they bite just fine right here?"
He'd say, "Love what you got, buddy, not what you ain't"
And just about then that bobber would sink
And that outboard dream of mine would disappear
I grew up pretty lucky as far as lucky goes
Too broke for a boat
Too broke for a boat

I remember thinkin', wouldn't it be cool
To have an old flat bottom and an Evinrude?
And Daddy saying, "Son, don't they bite just fine right here?"
He'd say, "Love what you got, buddy, not what you ain't"
And just about then that bobber would sink
And that outboard dream of mine would disappear
I grew up pretty lucky as far as lucky goes
Too broke for a boat
Too broke for a boat

A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink, and wet

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Where are we goin' when we leave here?
When the music's over and the bar runs out of beer
If we stay too late, they're gonna kick us out
Is it cool if I come crash at your house?
Where are we going? The night is young
And we're both half sober, hell bent on having fun
You say if we hook up, there'll be no strings attached
Save my number, you don't have to call me back
Let's have some cigarettes and find a spot that ain't closed yet
And if it is, we'll buy a box of wine
I just had to talk to you, forgive me if this comes out rude
You got to know it's true, but girl, you look so fine

Where are we going? If nowhere else
There's an old field road, out past the shut down Shell
We could shine those eyes, we could count them stars
Borrow some signs, go fishing in the dark
We'll sing some old Hank Junior songs, "Outlaw Women" all night long
Make some good ol' down home memories
There's something 'bout the sky tonight, something 'bout your blue eyes
Baby, you remind me of my sweetest dream
My sweetest dream
My sweetest dream
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

Where are we going? If this is love
There's no way to know but just between the two of us
It all feels so right with you in my arms
Where it's going, I don't know, but let's keep following our hearts
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Yeah
Hmm, hmm
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh

Every time I see you, every time I see you
Top of the world I'm standing rocking at my best
Then I look like a fool
Every time I see you, every time I see you

You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away, and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood
I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you

I want to tell you everything I ever wanted to say
But I never do
Every time I see you, every time I see you
I'm sure my steering wheel and dashboard
Would love a good break but they feel it too
Every time I see you, why I got to see you?

You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away, and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday

I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you


Oh, you're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away, and I can't pass through

Bringing me down, messing with my mood
I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you
Every time I see you, oh yeah

Oh, I'm walking down the street
And you walk right up to me and I freeze
Every time I see you

Talk about an uphill battle
Two thousand acres of beans and cattle
But he don't ever get rattled
He just goes 'til the sun goes down
Hydraulic fluid on his jeans
Red dye diesel and ten rows between
A cold one on the porch and a good night's sleep
Y'all hold 'em up with me now

Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife that loves him every night
Raising a son, raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer

Subdivisions creeping on in
Neighborhood kids keep jumping his fence
He could double his money
But that'd be the end of a promise he'll never break
Cause he looked his daddy in the eye
And he's got that stubborn pride
He'll be here 'til the day he dies
No, he wouldn't have it any other way

Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife that loves him every night
Raising a son, raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer


Here's to the farmer that loves his day in the sun
Won't sell that ol' half-ton
Nobody knows better 'bout a hard-earned dollar
Just tell him how far he's gotta go and he'll go farther
Here's to the farmer
Here's to the farmer
Thank you, boys

3 ContributorsWin Life Lyrics
Ain't tryna to be hero
Just tryna cash a paycheck
'Til the clock hits zero
Make the most of these days left
Found a few shortcuts
Picked up a couple secrets
Don't have it figured out yet
But I've learned the hard way, it's...

More drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
Just trying to win life

Man, in a couple scrapes, I...barely got out of
Got a couple scars, I...kinda ain't proud of
But you can't be afraid to drive until the gas can's empty
And if you're glass is half full, you better make damn sure it's whiskey

And be more drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
Watching those numbers on the scoreboard clock unwind
Still trying to win life

But if you lose yourself in someone else
Than maybe you don't lose at all

Just be more more drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
And that hail Mary's coming down on the five yard line
And I'm trying to win life

Just trying to win life
I'll be trying to win life

She called and said she wanted to see me
I say, "Yeah, that's fine, baby, drop on by"
I figured I could make it better
Just like every other time we had this fight
Of all the kind of over it could've been
I never would've bet on this

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on, she's gone
She ain't pulling over, it's just over

When she left the kitchen, she left no questions
I said where in the world did I go wrong?
And it don't matter where she's headed
She's gone, gone, gone

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on, she's gone
She ain't pulling over, it's just over

Like the page, she's turning over
Like the light, she's starting over
Without me

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on, she's gone
She ain't pulling over, it's just over

It's just over
Yeah, it's just over
It's just over

Whistling a feel good song
Got the sun on my face, nothing in my way
So I keep rocking along

I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

The people downtown are hustling around
The weight of the world on their mind
Me I'm sitting in the shade soaking up the day
Watching them all roll by

I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

I like it laid back like a baby blue Cadillac
Easing on down the road
I like it nice and slow laying low
Rolling anywhere the wind may blow

I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't you worry

6 ContributorsPick It Up Lyrics
I put a fishing rod by your bed
Right next to a bible
I leaned a guitar in the corner of your room
With some Milsap on vinyl
I figured the best thing I could do was put a thing or two
And that it wouldn't hurt to have in your way, on your path

Hoping you might pick it up one day
And you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
You just pick it up, pick it up

Early to rise, headin' to work
Open a door for a stranger
Yes sir, yes Mama, red dirt on my hands
Showing you the best way I can

So you might pick it up one day
And you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
Cause I helped make you
But i didn't never try to make you pick it up
Yeah, you just pick it up

Dancing and kissing your Mama in the kitchen
Treatin' her like a princess, hoping you might pick it up one day
Hoping you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it
I don't know what you gonna be
But i hope you smile when you think of me
Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
Yeah, you just pick it up, pick it up
You just pick it up, pick it up, yeah

I hope you pick it up
You just pick it up

[Song 64: Land of a Million Songs]
5 ContributorsLand of a Million Songs Lyrics
You don't know why, you can't make it stop
You were hooked with your daddy's hand-me-down flat top
The first time that you made your first love cry
And the words you wrote were running from her eyes
Down on the paper, made you feel so alive
So you packed up your pickup and crossed that Tennessee line

You're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told you don't belong
You drink too much in a smokey little bar downtown
Stumble home when it's time to throw in the towel
Wake up in the morning, look out, and the sunlight hurts
Find your old guitar, write down another verse
In the land of a million songs

Everybody's got a story that needs to be sold
And they pray someday they'll hang a little gold
And ride back to their hometown with their head held high
On any given day, there's a dream, there's a chance
That lightning will strike at the end of a pen
And all the leaving, and losing, will all be worth the fight

So you're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told you don't belong
You take that loan dot job just to pay the rent
You learn a few things from them hard-working men
You listen to 'em laugh and you listen to 'em curse
You find your old guitar and write down another verse
In the land of a million songs

Some will come and some will go
If you don't lay it all out there, you'll never know

You're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told, boy, you don't belong
You drink too much in a smokey little bar downtown
Stumble home when it's time to throw in the towel
Wake up in the morning, look out, and the sunlight hurts
You find that old guitar and write down another verse
In the land of a million songs
In the land of a million songs

[Song 65: What Country Is]
8 ContributorsWhat Country Is Lyrics
There's a house fly swimming in my sweet tea
Hey darling pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter dripping off a biscuit, baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like it's finally ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair sucking in swamp air
Two hundred mile marker signs from nowhere
That's what country is

It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hideaway bed in an old horse stall
Two kids getting caught stealing a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmie Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips
That's what country is

When the sun starts slipping from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
'Bout an hour 'til we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole waving at the riverboats
And when they're gone, take a dip in the moon glow
That's what country is

It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hideaway bed in an old horse stall
Two kids getting caught stealing a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips
That's what country is

It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture
It's cars pulling over for a no-cab tractor
It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips
No, it can't be bought, it's something you're born with
That's what country is
That's what country is
That's what country is
That's what country is

[Song 66: Scarecrows]
4 ContributorsScarecrows Lyrics
We didn't have no downtown strip
We'd all pile in and take a 2 mile trip
To where the road runs out
Sit there and sip on whatever anybody's older brother could get
Where we worked in the dirt and fell in love
Got my heart broke, broke down my truck
Trying to spin out, show off in that mud too many times

So much has changed
But then again, it ain't

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows

I don't get back near enough and just like these fields
Yeah, we all grow up
And it takes a little more than a paper cup to get dizzy
This hundred acre stretch is buried in my bones
Don't matter how long that I've been gone
I can be anywhere and some song comes on
And it's like I never left home

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows

So much has changed
But then again, it ain't

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around on a Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows
Just like the scarecrows

[Song 67: You Don’t Know Jack]
10 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisYou Don’t Know Jack Lyrics“You Don’t Know Jack” appears as the sixth track on Bryan’s album, Tailgates & Tanlines.
He asked me for a dollar, I said "Go get a job"
I turned up my collar and started walking off
He said "I don't blame you, I know what you think
I'd just spend your money, to buy another drink"

But you don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call
If you think it's just a bottle
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack

He showed me a picture, of two little girls
Wearing Easter dresses, hair done up in curls
He said "God bless their mamma
She said I couldn't stay
And buddy if you're wondering
How could I throw it all away"

You don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call
If you think it's just a bottle
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack

If you never felt the fire
Running through your veins
If you've never seen the devil
Face to face

You don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
So brother just be glad, and tonight
Hold your kids, kiss your wife
And when you talk to God
Count up all your blessings
And thank the good Lord that
You don't know Jack
You don't know Jack

[Song 68: Way Way Back]
6 ContributorsWay Way Back Lyrics
Hey, baby, it's been a minute since
Me and you got caught up in
A little wild and young kinda reckless love
That song that was playing when we first kissed
Yeah, you probably don't think I remember it
Got it in the truck
I can dial it up

Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moon shine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Baby, don't try to hide that smile
I can see that memory in your mind
Running all around, we can chase it down
You look even better than you did back then
Girl, close your eyes and we'll be there in no time
And we can rewind it

Way, way, back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Like an old school song
Two of us just hanging on to the night
Wouldn't you like to go there, baby?

Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back

[Song 69: Country Song Came On]
7 ContributorsCountry Song Came On Lyrics
Another long, hard, workin' day gone
Time to pack it up and head on home
Sun's gonna rise, and I know I gotta do it all over again
There's only two ways through this town, and I don't ever take the other way around
I see the lights, and I slow down
It's like they pull me in

I was gonna drive by, wasn't gonna stop
Then my old truck found a front row spot
Gonna drop in, but I wasn't gonna stay
Then I heard a barstool callin' my name
Wasn't gonna let the bar twist my arm
But I'm helpless in a honky tonk
Said I wasn't gonna drink
And then a country song came on

I was almost one boot out of the door when the band kicked in Two, three, four
Blame it on ETC for keepin' that neon burnin' on me

I was gonna drive by, wasn't gonna stop
Then my old truck found a front row spot
Gonna drop in, but I wasn't gonna stay
Then I heard a barstool callin' my name
Wasn't gonna lеt the bar twist my arm
But I'm helpless in a honky tonk
Said I wasn't gonna drink
And thеn a country song came on, yeah

I was gonna get a good night's sleep
And then a country song came on
Save it for the end of the week
And then a country song came on

I was gonna drive by, wasn't gonna stop
Then my old truck found a front row spot
Gonna drop in, but I wasn't gonna stay
Then I heard an old flame callin' my name
Wasn't gonna let the bar twist my arm
But I'm helpless in a honky tonk
Said I wasn't gonna drink
And then a country song came on
I wasn't gonna drink
Then a country song came on

No, I wasn't gonna drink
Yeah, a country song came on

10 ContributorsCountry Man Lyrics
You need hands, rough not soft
To come and warm you up, up in that cold hayloft
Let me hold you little darling in my big strong arms
Can't get these kind of muscles anywhere but a farm

Hey, I'm a country man
A city boy can't do the things I can
I can grow my own groceries and salt cure a ham
Hey baby, I'm a country man

I've got a jeep with camouflage seats
That way nobody sees us parked back up in these trees
Your little iPod loaded down with Hoobastank
Don't be a tape player hater girl were cruising to Hank

Hey, I'm a country man
A city boy can't do the things I can
I can grow my own groceries and salt cure a ham
Hey baby, I'm a country man

You like the ivy league Humvee tennis sweater type
But girl, I'm here to tell you, don't believe the hype

Hey, I'm a country man
I can wrestle hogs and gators with my two bare hands
Girl, you better move quick I'm in high demand
Hey, baby, I'm a country man

Hey I'm a country man
Hunting me a good ol' country girlfriend
Why don't you come and join me in my new deer stand?
Hey, baby, I'm a country man
Hey, baby, I'm a country man

We were as young as we were dumb
When we piled in an old pile of junk
It was one for all, and all for one
A bunch of outlaws without a gun
Shootin' bad booze outta Dixie cups
Chasin' every girl that wasn't fast enough
No matter how bad the break or how bad the luck
Or how bad the day we still had us

Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yeah, brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers

I got a scar on my cheek from a bar room brawl
Wasn't meant for me but I took the fall
It's a cowboy code, it's an unwrote law
When you mess with one you gotta take us all

Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yeah, brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers, yeah, yeah, uh huh

Time can fly on by, everything can change
Until the day we die, we'll always remain
Yeah, we'll remain
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yeah, brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another

Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

[Song 73: I Don’t Know How To Pronounce Gyro]
5 ContributorsI Don’t Know How To Pronounce Gyro LyricsFirst aired on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon with country superstar Luke Bryan. It talks about the pronunciation of the word “gyro”.
Hey, you want some lunch? I'm buying
Yeah man, I'm starving. What are you getting?
I'll have the falafel plate, please. How about you?
The uh, you know the uh, that thing there
(I can't see, which one?)
Um, the brown stuff that you, uh, you know, it's...
Man, man I'm good
Are you kidding me? What's going on man, you okay?
Not exactly

I was born in Southwest Georgia
Always tried to make my daddy proud
But of all the things I've learned there
Never learned how to say that word out loud
I just want something to eat
Made with a vertical rotisserie of lamb meat

I think I know just what you're going through
The way they spelled that gosh darn word seems like a trap
It's just lamb meat and other stuff rolled up in a pita
I wish they'd just called it a lamb tzatziki wrap
I could eat a thousand ounces
If I just knew how to pronounce it

Is it gee-ro, jyro, here-o, or yai-ro?
Never been filled with so much doubt
Is it gwy-ro, ga-hee-ro, yurro, or worbtse?
We can safely rule that last one out

I can't believe I don't know how to say
I eat so many that you'd really think I would
Well my friend it looks like we're in a pickle
Actually a pickle on a wrap sounds pretty good
Well always thought I was a pretty cultured dude
Been to the Taj Mahal, the Great Wall, and the Louvre
I'm fluent in Italian and efficient in Croatian
But when it comes to pronunciation of this particular word...
I'm an abomination

Is it gyro? Is it gyro? I'll ask my friend from Kairo
He's usually pretty good with this stuff
Or maybe I'll just mumble it when I place my order
(Not so fast, I caught your bluff)
Well, uh, how would you pronounce it then?
(Gyro)

It is gyro, it is gyro
Now I know it's gyro
The truth is so delicious to find
No more fearo, you're a hero
Cause now I know it's gyro
I finally got some piece of mind
We finally got some piece of mind

I'll take one gyro please
(You got it, buddy)
Um, can I change that actually
I'd love a shish keabob with a little extra humus

[Song 74: Dirt Road Diary]
8 ContributorsDirt Road Diary Lyrics
Me and daddy'd ride around all day shooting doves off a line in a Chevrolet
Old lab would jump out the back and fetch them up
We would drive for miles and miles and never once hit blacktop or change the dial
One little country station was all there was
Checking gates, fixing fence and roads
That is how my story goes

If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary
It's right there for you to see
Every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Ridin' round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary

I remember when I turned sixteen; I got a license and some gasoline
Ain't a curve or a straight away we didn't fly down
If it wasn't the boys, it was me and her by fire in a field or down on the river
Every inch of that county was sacred ground
I wish I knew where that old truck was
If it could talk, it could tell on us

If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary
It's right there for you to see
Every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Ridin' round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary

It ain't a book underneath my bed
Just a dusty memory lane burned in my head

Tan legs and some Dixie land delight
Ridin' round, windows down, feelin' right
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary
Just ride around my little town and you'll see how I wrote my dirt road diary

7 ContributorsKansas Lyrics
They say it's patient, they say it's kind
I know I don't come close to it most of the time
It ain't easy, can drive you insane
It's one little word that's so hard to explain

But when I say it to you, girl, this is what it means
To a blue jean, boot wearin', good ol' boy like me

If it's red dirt, I'll give you Georgia
Every mile of every backroad
If it's a shoreline, I'll give you California
Every wave crashin' on that Gold Coast
If it's a mountain, girl, I'll give you Colorado
I'll do anything for ya', baby, God knows
I don't know what love is, don't understand it
But if it's a wheat field, I'll give you Kansas

I know it sounds crazy, but baby, it's true
Whatever it is, I promise, I'll give it to you
Without thinkin' or blinkin' an eye
'Cause you give me the whole world with one little smile, so

If it's red dirt, I'll give you Georgia
Every mile of every backroad
If it's a shoreline, I'll give you California
Every wave crashin' on that Gold Coast
If it's a mountain, girl, I'll give you Colorado
I'll do anything for ya', baby, God knows
I don't know what love is, don't understand it
But if it's a wheat field, I'll give you Kansas

Yeah, when I say it to you, girl, this is what it means
To a blue jean, boot wearin', good ol' boy like me

If it's red dirt, I'll give you Georgia
Every mile of every backroad
If it's a shoreline, I'll give you California
Every wave crashin' on that Gold Coast
If it's a mountain, girl, I'll give you Colorado
I'll do anything for ya', baby, God knows
I don't know what love is, don't understand it
But if it's a wheat field, I'll give you Kansas

I don't know what love is
Can't say I really understand it
Oh, but girl, if it's a wheat field
I'll give you Kansas

[Song 76: Been There, Done That]
7 ContributorsBeen There, Done That Lyrics
Girl you and me ain't talking much
I just slam the door and leave in my truck
There aren’t nothing left for us I think enough's enough
I look down see your name there on my phone
Then I hit ignore and just drive on
We've been living like this too long
And there ain't no reason to turn around, baby you can have it all

I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time's the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I aren’t coming back
I've been there done that

Street by street and town after little town
Feels like I'm on the right road now
I bet you're probably wondering how I could just walk out
I put you high up as I could
And I know I've done everything I should
To try to make a bad thing good
I guess it just took too long for me to see
We weren't meant to be

I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time's the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back
I've been there done that

I'll wake up, and I'll start to second guess myself
And I'll crave your touch, oh but I know too well

That I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time's the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back
No, I ain't coming back
I've been there done that

[Song 77: Too Damn Young]
6 ContributorsToo Damn Young Lyrics
We met down at the floating dock
She snuck out scared, she might get caught
We were nervous, but it was worth it
There was no such thing as consequence
With her in my arms it finally made sense
In that moonlight, I saw her tan lines

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

The fog rolled in, she said "I'd better go"
She took my t-shirt and wore it home
A memory, a souvenir she could keep
So I stayed and watched that sunrise
Like it was waking up my life
To what love was, I can still see us

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

We were too damn young to know any better

6 ContributorsI Know You’re Gonna Be There Lyrics
I'm going to put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Take a deep breath
Try to keep my cool
I know you're going to be there
I'm going to have a couple drinks, just to knock off the edge
Not too much, don't want to make a fool of myself
I know you're going to be there, I know you're going to be there

And I'm going to bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm going to pull her in close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just want to see if you still care
I know you're going to be there

You love the band that's playing, you wouldn't miss them for the world
All our friends are coming out and if I know one thing, girl, I know you're going to be there
Going to walk right by that table where you always like to sit
And when I run into you, it's going to be an accident
I know you're going to be there
I'm going to act like it ain't nothing, but another Friday night
And you're just some old friend and I'm doing just fine
Like I'm only going out to shake off another week
Maybe see the boys and catch a buzz somewhere
But I know you're going to be there

And I'm going to bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm going to pull her in real close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just want to see if you still care
I know you're gonna be there
I know you're gonna be there

I'm going to put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Truth is when I see you, I don't know what I'll do

I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I lose my cool in the open and it shows
That I’m down and I ain't alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets want to know then I’ll tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues

I ain't sure where it all began
Somewhere 'round here I know
This bridge was a little more crowded then
I was playing her a tailgate show
And now I’m just sitting here alone

To catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I lose my cool in the open and it shows
That I’m down and I ain't alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets want to know then I’ll tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues

Damn that AM radio
For playing more than a song
My heart won’t beat if the strings are broke
The melody’s hitting me wrong
Right here where she belongs

I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I lose my cool in the open and it shows
That I’m down and I ain't alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets want to know then I’ll tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues

The crickets heard my story and I listened to them sing
I guess I’ll close the tailgate up
There aren’t no telling what tomorrow might bring
Maybe me and a Dixie cup
But that won’t be enough

Yes I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I lose my cool in the open and it shows
That I’m down and I ain't alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets want to know then I’ll tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues

I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I lose my cool in the open and it shows
That I’m down and I ain't alright

[Song 80: Suntan City]
10 ContributorsSuntan City LyricsTrack #1 on Spring Break…Here To Party.
This is the second to last EP Luke Bryan released for his annual Spring Break concert down in Panama City Beach.
(It's 'bout that time a year again!)
It was bumper to bumper when I hit that county
So I stopped and let the top down
Speakers where a bumping
Little hip-hop something
I was stirring up a coke and crown
Didn't even check in the room
We went straight for the beach
Didn't even give the ice a chance to melt
Now I'm scouting my spot
Where we were going to rock
With the biggest buzz I ever felt

Now I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching these rays
Watching coconut covered girls

They keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand
(Who!)
Hey there cutie with a Kentucky coozie
Have you ever hung with a Georgia boy?
And why don't you and your friends
Ease on over here and chug a beer with Miss Illinois?

Yea I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching' these rays
Watching coconut covered girls

They keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand

I got to buddy who blew all his money
And he had to stay his broke-ass home
He's been going crazy, blowing up my phone
Wanting to know what’s going on

I tell him I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching these rays
Watching coconut covered girls

And they keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand
(Yeah!)

Sitting pretty, right here in Suntan City

[Song 81: Mind Of A Country Boy]
5 ContributorsMind Of A Country Boy Lyrics
Is the trickle charger hooked up to the boat?
Is the pattern right on my turkey choke?
Are them Appaloosa cats gonna bite?
If they do, are we fryin' 'em tonight?
Is the price of corn gonna turn around?
Is diesel cheaper two exits down?
Are we drinking beer at the bar
Or shootin' whiskey down on the farm?

Does she like old-school Alabama or Mamas Don't Let Your Babies?
Is it farmers' market roses or a handful of dirt road daisies?
Ooh-ooh, are them stars lined up just right
Ooh-ooh, for stealin' me a kiss tonight?
That's what weighs on, that's what stays on
The mind of a country boy

Do I sell my truck or do I trade it in?
Is it a Muck boot night or my gator skins?
A honky tonk or the river bend?
This back and forth don't ever end
Is it a trot line tied to a boat dock or a cane pole on a bream bed?
Is it a humpback 12 or my Daddy's ol' 20?
Has my best bird dog been fed?

Ooh-ooh, I'm lovin' this life I live
Ooh-ooh, it damn sure don't get better than this
That's what weighs on, that's what stays on
The mind of a country boy

Ooh-ooh, is Daddy ever gonna slow down?
Ooh-ooh, there he is, callin' me right now

Does she like old-school Alabama or Mamas Don't Let Your Babies?
Is it farmers' market roses or a handful of dirt road daisies?
Ooh-ooh, are them stars lined up just right
Ooh-ooh, for stealing me a kiss tonight?
That's what I was raised on
That's what weighs on, that's what stays on
The mind of a country boy

The mind of a country boy
The mind of a country boy
The mind of a country boy
The good ol' mind of a country boy

[Song 82: Love It Gone]
5 ContributorsLove It Gone Lyrics
I know, I know it, baby
Sounds like your day's been crazy
I just wanna hold ya
All the weight that's on your shoulders
Anything that's wrong
Let me, let me love it gone
Come on and trust me, honey
I can turn those raindrops sunny
Let me untie that tangle
Put on that Kiss an Angel Good Mornin' song
Let me, let me love it gone

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, check it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone

Why don't you slip into a little something off the secret menu
Kick back and let down your hair
Yeah, that one right there looks so damn good on
Let me, let me love it gone

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, check it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone
So long

This night looks good on you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it
And every little inch of you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, check it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone
Baby, let me love it gone

Let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me love it
Let me, let me love it

[Song 83: Spring Breakdown]
5 ContributorsSpring Breakdown LyricsTrack #4 on Luke Bryan’s album “Checkin' Out”
Probably the most “sentimental” song on the EP giving tribute to his concerts during Spring Break in Panama City Beach.
It's been a real good run
Playin' out here in the sun
Year after year, beer after beer
I've watched this crowd grow
I swear you all don't know
What you mean to me
It's been something to see
I remember when we started
This week long party
And to think that it's over
It makes me want to spring break down

Just think about all our good times together
Yea, how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down

Next year I'll go through pictures
Wishin' I was down there with ya
Hanging out, it'll kill me then
But I'm here right now
So let's raise up our cups
Can't throw 'em up high enough
Let me buy you one last round
Before I spring break down

Just think about all our good times together
Yea, how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down

We made this sun tan city
And all of ya'll sang along so loud
We took this beach town over
Y'all don't know it might sound crazy
But you gonna make me spring break down

Just think about all our good times together
And when we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
Ooo...but the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down
Swear I'm about to spring break down

Ya'll up there on them shoulders
Good and bad hangovers
I'm about to spring break down

[Song 84: Harvest Time]
5 ContributorsHarvest Time Lyrics
There's peanut dust and corn husks drifting through the air tonight
The marching band's warming up under the football lights
There's tractor-trailers backed up down by the elevator
Train track grain car will roll in later
Get filled up and head on out in the world

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon coming up in the sky
Combine's cutting in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time

There's a thermos and a water jug rolling around in the cab
A set of socket wrenches wrapped up in a greasy red rag
Bobby's mother pulls in the field bringing us supper
We grab a bite and make sure to hug her
Saddle back up and let the big wheels roll

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon coming up in the sky
Combine's cutting in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time

At a quarter 'til 2 I kick off my boots in the laundry room
We'll start it all over tomorrow at noon
Till it's all done until we're all done

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon coming up in the sky
Combine's cutting in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time
It's harvest time

[Song 85: Love Me in a Field]
2 ContributorsLove Me in a Field Lyrics
Don’t need a hotel or a high-rise
A big ol’ boat with a fancy name
Don’t need a backseat
Don’t need no rusty truck bed
We can leave that dust on that ol’ porch swing

Let’s get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out in the rye grass
Lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Baby, love me in a field

Now we got that California king
In the back of that Georgia double-wide
And I’m ‘bout to bust out the seams
When I get you to the country side
What’s that sound like to you?
Cause it sounds dang good to me
Just hit me with a smile when you’re ready to leave

Let’s get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out in the rye grass
Lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Baby, love me in a field

Find an old pasture where the cows ain’t been for a while
Wanna see your blue eyes where the flowers grow wild
Little after midnight, morning dew on our skin
Promise you won’t nobody, nobody know where we’ve been

Let’s get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out in the rye grass
Lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Baby, love me in a field

Love me in a field
Love me in a field
In a big ol’ field

[Song 86: Driving This Thing]
3 ContributorsDriving This Thing Lyrics
I know this town like the back of my hand
Every back road, every turn road
Baby, where you wanna go?
Get you there with my eyes closed
Just pick the spot, say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight you're calling the shots

We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight

Been waiting all day just to see what you got on
Is it your high heels, your blue jeans?
Maybe that red dress, or climing up in your bare feet
I'll put the pedal down, but baby, you got the keys

We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight

Just pick a spot, just say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight, you're calling the shots

We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight

You're driving this thing tonight
Just pick a spot, just say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight, youre calling the shots

[Song 87: Take My Drunk Ass Home]
3 ContributorsTake My Drunk Ass Home Lyrics
It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well, I worked all week
So I could come here
Have a good time and an ice cold beer
But one turned to 10 and 10 turned to 20
And 20 plus an empty bottle's too damn many

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well it seems that I, misplaced my shirt
I can’t find my keys for all this parking lot dirt
My fall back plan, has done got sad
'Cause my ex-girlfriend aren’t looking half bad

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home
"Help me up, aww, put me back down, put me back down"

I sucker punched my best friend
And the bouncer head locked me on stage with the band
I, I look like hell, I feel like shit
I think it’s time I call it quits

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my money's all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Yeah, it’s time to take my drunk ass home
I twisted up my ankle, can’t find my cell phone
Yeah, my lips all busted and my buzz is gone
It's time to take my drunk ass home
If y'all agree, then sing along
It's time to take, my drunk ass home

"Oh somebody call me a cab, please"

[Song 88: We Rode In Trucks]
7 ContributorsWe Rode In Trucks Lyrics
Down where I was born was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
We raised cotton, corn, a little cane, and kids
You either lived on a farm or wish you did
Jesus always walked close by our side
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks

There's a lot about life you can learn on a bus
How to lie, how to fight, how to kiss, how to cuss
The closer we sat to the back, the smarter we got
We were poor, we were ugly, we were all best friends
Wide-eyed, baptized, and still wanting to sin
Thank God we get more than just one shot
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks

That's us, hauling hay in the field with the radio on
That's us, heading straight into town when the work was done
In my mind, I can still see us now, riding down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago

We thought tobacco and beer in a can
Was all it would take to be like our old man
But I saw how it made my momma cry
It was hunting and fishing and football games
Then it was girls, and everything changed, in our lives
Falling in and out of love, we rode in trucks

That's us with our tailgates down in the parking lot
That's us with mud on our tires when it rained a lot
In my mind, I can still see us now, riding down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago, it's a part of my soul. Yeah

Down where I was born, was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks

7 ContributorsBeer in the Headlights Lyrics
Honey suckle in the air, breeze blowing through your hair
Hundred stars hanging high, under your still tide
Up in every move you make, baby I'm your DJ
You're my favorite song, won't you let me sing along

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and you're spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights

Heart beating like a drum, call me the lucky one
Shining these Hi-Beams on you baby
Boots stiring up the dirt Cottonfield concert
You got the beautiful, I got the cooler full

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and you're spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere (nowhere)
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
Oh, oh, oh

I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and you're spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights

3 ContributorsBuzzkill Lyrics
You're like a screen flashing, insufficient funds
Cops knocking when the party's just begun
You're a big rain cloud parked over my boat
You're a cell phone splashing in my coffee cup
A fumble on the one when my team was going up
You're like brakes on my brain and all I know

You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill

I used to do everything I could do to do nice things
No matter what I did or didn't do it didn't change
Everybody knows you ended us
So why you showing up here on my side of the tracks?
Slipping in this bar just to check out where I'm at
I was a six pack in, now I'm as sober as a judge, cause

You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill

As if it didn't hurt enough, now I got to see you flirt
Nailed to the stool, watching you work
Don't you give a damn about how I feel
You little brown haired, blue eyed, beautiful buzzkill
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're such a buzzkill

You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill

Old boat, new boat
Red boat, blue boat
Only thing better than one is two boats
Big church, small church
Come one, come all church
New sound, old sound
Small town, old town
If you're drinkin' better have enough for the whole town
Red dirt, clay dirt
Tryna get the pay dirt

Country did, as country does
Long as the salt gets licked and the corn grows thick and the sun comes up
Country is, as country was
'Round here the good ol' days ain't far away 'cause they can't change us
Proud of your family, proud of your name
Proud of the mud runnin' through your veins
They say nothing don't ever stay the way it was
But country does
Country does

Old folks, kin folks
Those folks, them folks
Talk about us gonna take it on the chin folks
Farm work, hard word
Kids do the yard work
Slow song, sad song
Growin' up on bad songs
Long as there's fiddle hell there really ain't a bad song
Cold beer, cheap beer
Plant our roots and our boots and our feet here

Country did, as country does
Long as the salt gets licked and the corn grows thick and the sun comes up
Country is, as country was
'Round here the good ol' days ain't far away 'cause you can't change us
Proud of your family, proud of your name
Proud of the mud runnin' through your veins
They say nothing don't ever stay the way it was

Find me a place in the sand
Clean these old shades off
Damn, y'all don't understand
All she wants to do is dance

She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Clouds roll by
She get me high

Don't nobody block my view
Hell you can find a spot and watch too
Watch how she makes this beach
Light up like the sky on New Year's Eve
Love it when she's locked on me

She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high

She said, "Boy, it's time to take me home"
Don't even grab your stuff
Just lay me on down
Need the pool and moonshine
You 'bout to be all mine

She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet, in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high

Clouds roll by
She get me high

4 ContributorsGoodbye Girl LyricsYeah, I know that color on your lips too well
I saw you blowing kisses down the wishing well again
When I say I love you, just just say "I know."
You put your arms around me, but it's all for show
And then, there you go wrecking my whole world
All fixed up, my goodbye girl
You scatter in the wind just like a dandelion
Reminding me again that you ain't ever mine for long
But I know it's gonna happen when the moon is right
You'll show up at my door and pull me in just like a song
There you go, wrecking my whole world
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl
It might seem crazy to keep loving you this way
But I'll never bring myself to say goodbye, girl
The sun is gonna make it's way around again
But the rain is always waiting just around the bend
And there you go, wrecking my whole world
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl
All fixed up, my goodbye girl
Goodbye girl

5 ContributorsBuddies Lyrics
Buddies, roll up in the morning and hand you a coffee
Tell ya hurry up, the fish ain't gonna wait on you
Buddies, don't give you no warning
When they shoot up a stop sign out on some old county road

I've got ones that I've fought with and outrun the law with
Ones that I'd give my last dime if I had it
One on the wagon and one out there dragging a plow
Behind an old John Deere
They work hard for their money, their boots all stay muddy
All my beer drinking, deer dragging, dusty dirt road riding buddies


Buddies, smell trouble 'fore it happens
And when it starts to happen they're right with you rolling in a parking lot
Buddies, make your girlfriends so mad, and keep your mama from sleeping
'Cause they both know too well that I've got

Ones that I've fought with and outrun the law with
Ones that I'd give my last dime if I had it
One on the wagon and one out there dragging a plow
Behind an old John Deere
They work hard for their money, their boots all stay muddy
All my beer drinking, deer dragging, dusty dirt road riding buddies

I got one in a Humvee that keeps all of us free
One that got his heart broke and went half crazy
Got one that moved far away, one that rings my phone every day
The one when he hears this he'll shed a tear
They work hard for their money, everything they've got's muddy
All my beer drinking, deer dragging, dusty dirt road riding, tailgating good time, trash, tall walking buddies
All my buddies

Ya'll know who you are
Catch ya'll on the flipside

3 ContributorsClosing Time In California Lyrics
It must be closing time in California
They must be shuttin' down those sunset bars
That's the only time that I hear from ya
Before my world lights up and yours goes dark
And there's a Western wave that called you out there
There's a Southern voice that wants you back
Can almost smell the smoke and cheap tequila
While I'm about to pour my coffee black

Now I've been tryin' to forget
And you've been tryin' not to miss
Me and move on
It must be closing time in California
Baby, cut me off or come back home
Mm-mm-mm

There's a ghost that dancеs in the driveway
In a dress that hit this hard pinе floor
Bet you're still in heels in your bed, sideways
Wishin' I was there to keep you warm
Damn, I wish that I was too, yeah, Lord

I've been tryin' to forget
You've been tryin' not to miss
Me and move on
It must be closing time in California
Baby, cut me off or come back home

Come back home
Come back home, yeah, yeah

I guess we never got the timin' right
Yeah, it's three on your wall and five on mine

It must be closing time in California
If what you went to find just ain't out there
Then it's closing time in California
And, baby, Tennessee ain't gone nowhere

When your phone's in the truck and you're camo'd up
And your mind's just runnin' free
It might look like huntin'
But it's way more than that to me

I do my prayin' in a deer stand
On my back-forty church
Thinkin' 'bout life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my Heaven on Earth
Me and God in a corn field
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods 'causе here I am
Prayin' in a deer stand

Some find it on a piеr where they used to fish with their old man
Some feel it when the choir sings
And that light hits that stained glass
We're all down here searchin' for an answer or a sign
The way those clouds are movin' in
I think He's hearin' me just fine

I do my prayin' in a deer stand
On my back-forty church
Thinkin' 'bout life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my Heaven on Earth
Me and God in a corn field
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods 'cause here I am
Prayin' in a deer stand
Prayin' in a deer stand (Woo)

My boots back on the ground, my head back right
You got your ways of gettin' through, I got mine

I do my prayin' in a deer stand
Out on my back-forty church
Thinkin' 'bout life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my Heaven on Earth
Me and God in a corn field
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods 'cause here I am
Prayin' in a deer stand
Prayin' in a deer stand

4 ContributorsYou Look Like Rain Lyrics
You and your Sunday mornings
Me and my Saturday nights
You and all your colors
Me and my black and whites
You and your lace and cotton
Up against my whiskey skin
Saving me the way you always do, yeah

'Cause I'm hell up here on a high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins
In a gust of wind
That's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain

You and your stain glass windows
Me and my cracked windshield
You and your quiet beauty
Me and my can't sit still

'Cause I'm hell up here on a high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins
In a gust of wind
That's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain

Girl, I'm hell up here on a high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins
In a gust of wind
That's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain

You look like rain
(You look like
You look like
You look like rain)
You look like rain
Ye-yeah
You look like rain
You look like rain
You must be rain...

[Song 98: We Run This Town]
6 ContributorsWe Run This Town Lyrics
Seventeen, we owned those streets
Parking lot, that was our spot
That’s where we’d always meet
And we’d roll on out in a pickup truck parade
Stake our claim with a fire in a field in the middle of Nowhere, USA
We’d light the midnight up

We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
We thought we made the world go ‘round
Nothin’ but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town

All the girls next door
They’d meet us out there
They couldn’t wait to get away
And come and let down their hair
We were rough around the edges
They were sweet as they could be
They were way too good
But they still let us steal a little kiss before they’d leave
Guess they thought we were cool because

We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
Yeah, we thought we made the world go ‘round
Drop it down in four-wheel
Set up on a big hill
And make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town

From crazy kids to dirt road kings
Oh, we didn’t know nothin'
But we knew everything

We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
We thought we made the world go ‘round
Nothin’ but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town

High five and look around
Damn right, we run this town
Man, I love this town
Come on

[Song 99: For The Kids]
8 ContributorsFor The Kids Lyrics
Big backyard with a fence around it
Right next to the best school in the county
Sold the car and financed a Tahoe
With a third row
All week, you're runnin' from dance to baseball
The dinner you fixed gets cold while I take a call

You're tired all the time
I'm tired all the time

For the kids, I go to work, you stay at home
Do what we do just to get through and watch them grow
We fill this house with love
But somehow lose it between us
We swore we'd never end up likе this
Married for the kids

We can tеll that somethin' don't feel right
Try to talk it out on Wednesday date night
But always end up in some kind of big fight
Don't even know why
I guess I just miss my blue jean baby
And you miss your Friday night band

We keep holdin' on
'Cause we gotta be strong

For the kids, I go to work, you stay at home
Do what we do just to get through and watch them grow
We fill this house with love
But somehow lose it between us
We swore we'd never end up like this
Married for the kids


For the kids, we stay up cryin' all night long
But in my arms, I know it's right where you belong
We fill this house with love
It begins and ends with us
Baby, there ain't nothin' we can't fix
I know you don't want it, and I don't want it like this
Married for the kids
Married for the kids
(Mm-mm-mm)

4 ContributorsSouthern Gentleman Lyrics
You looked at me like I was crazy
When I said ma'am to that little old lady
You ain't heard talk like that lately
But I can see, it's got you smilin'
And you say you still remember
Our first date me cookin' you dinner
And how I didn't even try to kiss you
At the end of the date
'Cause I was raised to

Stand up when you walk in the door
Spin you around an old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom
Walk you down old Live Oak Road
Barefoot bridge, see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than
This Southern gentleman

I'm gonna, open up these plantation blinds
To the sun coming up in your pretty blue eyes
Tell you you're beautiful a thousand times a day
'Til you're in love with the way that I

Stand up when you walk in the door
Spin you around an old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom
Walk you down old Live Oak Road
Barefoot bridge, see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than
This Southern gentleman

Girl I'm gonna take you on a trip like back in time
Just put your hand in mine, and won't you

Come here when you walk in the door
Let me spin you around this old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom
Walk you down old Live Oak Road
Barefoot bridge see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than
Can't nobody ever love you better than

7 ContributorsApologize Lyrics
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I take another chance
Take a shot, take a fall for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new
I loved you with the fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you said
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground

[Song 102: My First Love Song]
6 ContributorsMy First Love Song Lyrics
Riding down the road listening to the radio
You leaned over and you turned it up
You said, "Baby this is it
The one I wanted you to hear
Don't it sound just like us?"
Up 'til then, all I'd ever listened to was
A little "Sweet Home," "Tuesday's Gone"
And "Working Man Blues."

This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from-now-on
My first love song

Baby I'm not who I was
You gave me your love and it woke me up
Made me more aware of something deep inside
Something that I have
A life I want to share
And I'll remember this as long as I live
Every note, every word, every single kiss

This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from now on
My first love song
Baby...

This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from-now-on
My first love song

Yeah baby
My first love song

[Song 103: Small Town Favorite]
2 ContributorsSmall Town Favorite Lyrics
How do you turn a scholarship down
Tear up a ticket, already punched
And watch a dream die?
Who is going to tell me how
To face Daddy
And watch Mamma cry?
Have I thrown my future away?
Played my last football game?
It all seems so strange
How in just one night
Your whole life can change

Wish this old John Deere had wings
And this cotton row was an airstrip
Straight out of here
Wish this high noon Georgia sun
Could melt what is been done
Make it disappear
If I could leave, I would be gone
But that is just one more thing done wrong
By this small town favorite son

By fall they are all going to know
Our little secret
My baby holds inside
By then she will be starting to show
And I will be the husband
To a shotgun bride
I already miss that sound
The marching bands and the cheering crowds
Stuck here in this red dirt ground
Knowing I, I let everybody down


That high noon Georgia sun
Cannot melt what is been done
Girl, I will be right here
I do not know much about life
But I know what is right
For this small town favorite son

I'm not supposed to want to love you no more
No more cards and flowers, no more knocks on your door
Just forget the perfect love that we had
But I don't know if I can do that
I was so certain baby you were the one
That this was it and all my searching was done
I should admit you don't get used to the fact
But I don't know if I can do that

I don't know if I can do that

I don't know how, I'll ever let you go
Since you walked out, there's so much I don't know

The things I'm feeling they just won't go away
I see you out and I don't know what to say
My friends all tell me that I oughta be glad
But I don't know if I can do that



Someday somebody, will really love me
And she'll be everything I thought you would be
And all I want to do is love her back
But I don't know if I can do that
I don't know if I can do that

[Song 105: I’ll Stay Me]
6 ContributorsI’ll Stay Me Lyrics
T-shirt, blue jeans
Don't like much on TV
Caviar and a Triscut
Aren't non Redeye gravy on a biscuit
My deep Southern drawl
Makes the conversation crawl
You're going to have to hang around
Long enough to hear me out
Some folks aren't happy like they are
Some want to take things just a little too far

Singers want to be Hollywood actors
And millionaires want to ride
Old farm tractors
I am just what I am
I'm just what you see
So I'll make it easy
I'll stay me

My granny and pawpaw
Still missing Hee Haw
And I love my little town
Where the people don't let you down
There's a girl down the street
Got a kiss just waiting on me
Hot dog sweet potato fries
When I go over tonight
She knows exactly who I am
A soft touching her love loving
Hardworking man

Quarterbacks want to play lead guitar
And supermodels want smaller body parts
Change is good sometimes
But I still believe
I'm going to make it easy
I'll stay me

Yeah singers want to be
Hollywood actors
And millionaires want to ride
Old farm tractors
I am just what I am
I'm just what you see
So I'll make it easy
I'll stay me

I'll stay me, I'm going to make it easy
I'll stay me

You got me all caught up
The way you look tonight
We could head downtown
Or I can turn around, up here, on the right
Ah, just look at this sky
The rain ain’t far from fallin’ down
And I wanna get to know you
Better than I know this little town, yes I do

I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops
Parked out in the middle of nowhere

There’s a place I can get up against your lips
That’s where I gotta be with you lookin' like this
Let’s get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ain’t gotta hold back
If we’re gonna go out, baby
Let's go out like that

And I’ll grab your door
You can take my hand
Hop up on my shoulders and I’ll walk us over
Where we can dance
And I’ll leave the headlights on
So, I can see your face
Spin you ‘round in the mud
Yeah, soak it all up, baby
What’cha say, what’cha say

I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops
Girl, I’m talkin' country kinda crazy, yeah

Out where I can get up against your lips
That’s where I gotta be with you lookin' like this
Let’s get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ain’t gotta hold back
If we’re gonna go out, baby
Let's go out like that

Yeah, I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops
Gettin’ country kinda crazy in the middle of nowhere

Out where I can get up against your lips
That’s where I gotta be with you lookin' like this
Let’s get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ain’t gotta hold back
If we’re gonna go out, baby

If we’re gonna go out, baby
Let’s go out like that
Yeah girl, that's where it's at
Let’s go out like that

Hey! Whiskey burns me up, wine turns my teeth all red
Tequila makes me loco, champagne hurts my head
But let me tell you I'm a real big fan, of ice fishing for them aluminum cans

I'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on my pop-top finger
Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack ready to roll
I'm a killer karaoke country singer, top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger
King of the grill and a short putt sinker
I'm just a cold beer drinker

Monday through 5 o' clock Friday I'm a hardworking man
Responsible, kind of dull, head-down, stick to the plan
But all my buddies know me better than that, get us all together and we start throwing them back

I'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on my pop-top finger
Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack ready to roll
I'm a killer karaoke country singer, top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger
King of the grill and a short putt sinker
I'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker

As far as I'm concerned, it's the All-American way
Twist the top off, just to cap off the day, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey

I'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on my pop-top finger
Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack raring to go
Don't you know I'm a killer karaoke country singer
Top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger, king of the grill and a short putt sinker
I'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker. Yeah

[Song 108: Songs You Never Heard]
8 ContributorsSongs You Never Heard Lyrics
I heard "Run" on the radio, yesterday
Got me thinking 'bout, how much you love George Strait
But by the time the airwaves ever played that song
You were already gone, you were already home

And there ain't no one that sounds like Whitley
But I'd bet you find something you'd sing with me
We weren't just

Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A lot about living, a little 'bout love
Time marches on, there's a lot of new
Music and memories we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard

Everything sounded better with the windows down
In your Silverado, rolling 'round that two lane town
Now there's a few more ball caps, a few less cowboy hats
But we're still singing 'bout dirt roads
I think you'd be okay with that

And I'm thinking about the way you would've acted
The first time you ever heard "In Color"
Man, it makes me wanna go back
When we were just

Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A lot about living, a little 'bout love
Time marches on, there's a lot of new
Music and memories we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard

You'd be a little off key
Out on the road with me
High fiving my whole band
Mama claims it but we all know
You'd be my number one fan
And we'd be

Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A lot about living, a little 'bout love
Time marches on, there's a lot of new
Music and memories we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard
To songs you never heard

6 ContributorsShe’s Still Got it Lyrics
That '97 Selica, rhinestone studded jeans
Tattoo on her wrist, Waylon with the wings
Homecoming runner up crown she wore
That nine-to-five job she don't want no more

Million dollar smile
Drives all the boys wild
When she walks through the door

'Cause she's still got it, she never lost it
The key to your heart's in her back pocket
Still got her number, but you never call it
'Cause you burned a bridge and can't get back across it
Saturday night, yeah, you saw her downtown
Out with somebody, way over you now
And you caught her eye, and she kind of waved
As she walked away, yeah, you couldn't say it
But everybody 'round here knows you damn sure thought it
"She's still got it"

That bucked-off-a-pony-as-a-kid little scar on her chin
And drunk singin' along to "Still Make Cheyenne"
Fallin' like the stars in the bed of your truck
That wildfire look that always lit you up
Yeah, and it still does

She's still got it, she never lost it
The key to your heart's in her back pocket
Still got her number, but you never call it
'Cause you burned a bridge and can't get back across it
Saturday night, yeah, she look like an angel
There in the neon, peelin' the label
You caught her eye, and she kind of waved
As she walked away, yeah, you couldn't say it
But everybody 'round here knows you damn sure thought it
"She's still got it"
She's still got it

She's still got everything that made you love her from the start
Everything that makes you hate it fell apart

She's still got it, she never lost it
The key to your heart's in her back pocket
Still got her number, but you never call it
'Cause you burned a bridge and can't get back across it
Saturday night, she looked better than ever
And that made you think, "Baby, never say never"
You caught her eye, and she kind of waved
As she walked away, yeah, you couldn't say it
But everybody 'round here knows you damn sure thought it
"She's still got it"

7 ContributorsFaded Away Lyrics
I don't remember much about that time
Just the smell of the air and your hand in mine
Riding the strip, sitting on my lap
In the back of the truck with the only friends I had
It was spring break, we were out late
And I thought goodness, for heaven’s sake
When I saw you
And then I kissed you

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you faded away

I still taste the shots on your lips that night
And the smoke from the club still burns my eyes
Feel of your body taking off your dress
Waking up that morning in a tangled mess
So if I would have known, I would have held on
A little bit longer and stronger with nothing to lose
Cause I still see you

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you (girl you)
(Faded) faded away

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
I watched you drive through the gate
Without saying the words I needed to say
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the tears on your face
And the sun going down that day
Girl you faded away
You faded away

There's sand from your shoes in my floorboard
Lipstick on the straw
Your crying eyes
Are painted in my rear view
My speaker still blasts that song
That you turn me on to

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
The salt air is pulling on my tailgate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
Cause you and the beach follow me home

Still hear your words saying we can't do this
Cause you're up there and I'm down here
Baby let's go on and face it

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
The salt air is blowing out my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
Cause you and the beach follow me home
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
´Cause there you are everytime I close my eyes
Is like we never even say good bye

We've been up here in this city
Livin' in the gears that grind
Girl, it's a doggone pity
We ain’t been gettin' any time
I've been preachin' 'bout back home
How it can make ya feel so alive
Tell you what we can do
Baby, let's, me and you, take a little drive

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Ain’t hearin' nothing, such a beautiful sound

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah-yeah

There ain’t no card in your pocket
If we're gonna turn that old gas pump on
It's cash for everything around here
That's just the way it's been for so long
How you like our Coke from a green glass bottle?
It's colder than that plastic stuff
Watch how Miss Annie at the counter
Tells that story 'bout me wreckin' my truck

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Ain’t hearin' nothing, such a beautiful sound

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah-yeah

Pine straw in your hair and not an ounce of makeup on you
As the sun goes down
Girl, I ain’t ever seen you lookin' so good
As you do right now

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Ain’t hearing nothing, such a beautiful sound

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah-yeah

Right there's an old stepside
How 'bout that blue sky?
So pretty it'll make you cry (Welcome to the farm)
We can roll on over yonder
Or sit right here and ponder
Watch the wind whirl by

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah

Some days you got it all together
You swear you have it figured out
Other days you're stumbling and a wondering
What the hell it's all about
Life's kind of funny like that
Sometimes you're the dog sometimes you're the cat
All you can do is just keep going
And thank God for what you have

Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along

Sometimes you get a bill in the mail
You don't know how you're going to pay
Then your baby wraps her arms around you
And makes it all go away
Life's kind of funny like that
Sometimes you're the train sometimes you're the track
And when that sun goes down
And there aren’t no going back

Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along
Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along

When it don't work out
And then he walks out
Before you look for number 3
Stop for a second
Maybe you'll reckon
You shoulda just stuck with me

I know I ain't perfect but least I've learned
I'd do anything for you
You might believe that your over me
But I'm still stuck on you

I keep on hoping
You had to go just so you could spread your wings
But come some sunrise
You'll come to realize
You shoulda just stuck with me


We're gonna look back
We're gonna laugh bout
Our ups and downs and in betweens
When you said goodbye and then you realized
Shoulda just stuck with me
Give it some time girl
You'll come to find
You shoulda just stuck with me

[Song 115: Your Mama Should’ve Named You Whiskey]
4 ContributorsYour Mama Should’ve Named You Whiskey Lyrics
Just a little taste won't hurt at all
But once I get a sip, I know I'm gonna wanna drink it gone, all gone
90 proof is an understatement
I get around you and I'm way past wasted
I can't think at all

Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
And every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you whiskey

Girl, you got a smile like a devil on my shoulder
Tempting me sayin', honey come over now, right now
I know I shouldn't wanna, but I think I'm probably gonna
Even though I know I'm gonna be wakin' up hurtin' in the morning
Shoulda come with a warning

Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
Yeah, and every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you whiskey

I'm addicted girl, I'm hangin on
I'm a fool in love, I'm long past gone
Yeah, so, come on

Your mama should've named you whiskey
And I never should've let you kiss me
Oh, and every time you leave it hits me
Oh baby, your mama should've named you whiskey

I'm addicted girl, such a fool
I'm addicted girl
Such a fool

[Song 116: If You Ain’t Here to Party]
4 ContributorsIf You Ain’t Here to Party Lyrics
We got beer, and a tub
And some good looking girls
Dressed to the nights
Looking for a good time
Jacked up trucks
Stacked in thick
White rocks stuck
In the mud grips
And a big 'ole bouncer at the door
But don't show him your I.D
And don't you dare step out on the floor

If you aren’t here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you aren’t here to party
You'll be missing out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And head your ass back home
If you aren’t here to party

There's a little 'ole Louisiana band
Playing a swampy jam and brown sugar tans
Looking so fine shaken that thing
In the zydeco Cajun purple rain
Raise your drink up in the air
And everybody sing along
Man, you're here all alone

If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And carry your ass back home
If you ain't here to party
If you aren’t here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you aren’t here to party
You'll be missing out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and pick someone out
Maybe make out
And get their number in your phone
Man, the only way that you'll be
Going home alone is
If you aren’t here to party

Yeah, you better be here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party

Throw your keys on the bar
You aren’t driven' your car
You're here with me
That's how it's going to be

Cause we're here to party, baby
Yeah, yeah, whoa
If you aren’t here to party
You picked the wrong Friday night

[Song 117: Favorite Flowers]
6 ContributorsFavorite Flowers LyricsI guess we don't quite understand down here
What makes Him do the things He does
Why some people go so soon
While some grow old
I've learned we're just a step away
And tomorrow might be kind of tough
Nothings promised in this life
All you can do is believe

So it must have been the way the sunlight hit you
And shined upon your face
Or how the rain would find you
On the driest of days
Your smile in the morning
The way you'd reach for the sky
How you danced in the breeze
As people walked by
So it must be true
What I once heard
God picks His favorite flowers first
I bet He put you in his window sill
Looking out over this big old world
And I know Heaven sure does love
Having you around
In His eyes we're all the same
But I just gotta think when He saw you
And how perfect and pretty you were
He just couldn't wait


Yeah it must have been the way the sunlight hit you
And shined upon your face
Or how the rain would find you
On the driest of days
Your smile in the morning
The way you'd reach for the sky
How you danced in the breeze
As people walked by
So it must be true
What I once heard
God picks His favorite flowers first
Yeah it must be true
What I once heard
God picks His favorite
God picks His favorite
Flowers first

Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't know what you do
You don't know how bad you turn me on
You don't know what it does
You don't know how you don't do no wrong
You got me wrapped around your little finger
Oh, good lookin' girl
That little dimple when you smile might as well be a hook in my heart
It's so simple how I feel
I gotta just be wherever you are
Every time I pick you up
It's like you start...

Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, "oh boy you got it so damn good"

Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't have to say a thing
Just sit there and let me sing to you
Let the sun lit down, and the moon come around and just move ya
And let me just get lost in how good looking girl
You can be when you don't mean to be
'cause it's so natural
With your hair pulled up and my hat girl you know I can't handle
Some things I just can't handle
Cause you start

Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, "oh boy you got it so good with this good looking girl"

Good morning good looking girl
I ain't never felt nothing quite like when you're...

Rocking me, rocking me, gotta roll with it
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
And I'm gonna lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, "oh boy you got it so good with this good looking girl"

You're my good looking girl
What's up girl

[Song 119: The Car in Front of Me]
6 ContributorsThe Car in Front of Me Lyrics
Homecoming parade, you were the queen
I was riding right behind you with the rest of the team
Saw my ring on your finger as you waved to the crowd
I didn't know a second stringer could ever be so proud

The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream was in the car in front of me

On Wednesday nights, we'd meet at church
You'd bring the kids, and I'd come straight from work
Going home I'd read their lips through the window of your van
As they sang Jesus loves me, I thought God I'm a lucky man

The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream was in the car in front of me

Even after what the doctor said
You were strong and you believed
And you held us all together through one more spring
Their little hands held on to mine
As we sat in that backseat with tears in our eyes
A long line of headlights
Strangers stopped along the road
No Monday wasn't meant for wearing Sunday clothes

The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
Oh my sweetest dream was in the car in front of me

[Song 120: Bill Dance]
4 ContributorsBill Dance Lyrics
This ain't no lie

Saved all my birthday money up
Put it down on a rod and reel
I got my green and tan Plano loaded up
Permission to fish behind that old sawmill
Mama said, "Watch for snakes"
Daddy said, "Shut the gate"
Brother said, "They're bitin' on the zoom black and red flake"
Layin' in the bed that night
I swear I could barely sleep

'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Fishin' for a livin'
Saturday mornin' on television
A Georgia boy learnin' how to hook big bass
From a large mouth legend in a Tennessee hat
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance

While other boys were playin' ball and knockin' heads
I was floatin' on the Muckalee
While rebel kids were smokin', stealin' cigarettes
I was fishing in them cypress trees
Paddle and a Jon Boat, nine pound, no joke
Got him in the net 'cause I didn't get my line broke
Usin' every trick in the book daddy ever taught me

'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Fishin' for a livin'
Saturday mornin' on television
A Georgia boy learnin' how to hook big bass
From a large mouth legend in a Tennessee hat
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance

There's a lot of heroes out there these days
But if you ask me mine, there's only one name I'll say

Bill Dance, fishin' for a livin'
Saturday mornin' on television
A Georgia boy learnin' how to hook big bass
From the best damn fisherman the world's ever had
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Bill Dance

Yeah, the sun is just startin' to shine up over the treetops
It's gonna be a beautiful day, it's plain to see

[Song 121: In Love With the Girl]
5 ContributorsIn Love With the Girl Lyrics
It feels like I woke up one morning
And it all changed without warning
I don't know how our paths crossed
But all I know is I've been lost
Now it's hard to think
That we were ever strangers

Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancing on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singing
Or the way it all happened without even thinking
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes I'm in love with the girl

I talk about being caught off guard
Talk about an old boy falling hard
Think about a few weeks flying by
And talk about losing track of time
Now I'm counting every second until I see her

Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancing on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singing
Or the way it all happened without even thinking
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes I'm in love with the girl

I was cool with hanging around
Now I got plans bigger than this town
Saying things I aren’t never said
And being with her ever chance I get
Heard the old man say son when you know
Hold on tight and don't let go
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes I'm in love with the girl

Girl, there ain't no way you don't know
How pretty you are
Every mirror in this two lane town knows
The trouble you cause
I'd give anything to take that beer back
I sent your way
I shoulda just took a shot of warm whiskey
And called it a day

Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
Are we in, are we out, why you runnin' me around
Why you havin' such a damn hard time, girl, with the truth
What is it with you

I spent half the day all hungover
The morning after your kiss
I knew the second that you showed up, baby
It'd be another week of this
I keep prayin' that you mighta left something
Something when you got undressed
Something that you wanna come back for
Whatever you can do to get me back in your mess

Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
Are we in, are we out, why you runnin' me around
Why you havin' such a damn hard time, girl, with the truth
What is it with you
Oh, I ain't me, I ain't right
But I'll admit I kinda like all the heaven and hell
That you put me through
What is it with you
Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
What is it with you
Oh, what is it with you

I'm back taking the long way when I go home at night
And your memory don't dance down the whole way when I flip on the light
I'm back spending time with my buddies
A little 'Randy ain't never hurt nobody
Yeah I've come a long way getting over us
But now and then when your name comes up

I drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
When the wondering if you miss me, missing you comes around
Yeah it don't happen like it used to happen
But when it does I twist off the cap
And I drink a little whiskеy, drink a little whiskey down

No more 2:00 AM phonе calls to act like I'm checking in
No more running the other way when I run into your friends
I don't need your touch, I don't need your smile
Except for every little once in awhile

And drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
When the wondering if you miss me, missing you comes around
Yeah it don't happen like it used to happen
But when it does I twist off the cap
And I drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down

Drink a little whiskey down

Yeah just enough to get you gone
Grab a glass and pour one strong

And drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
When the wondering if you miss me, missing you comes around
Yeah it don't happen like it used to happen
But when it does I twist off the cap
And I drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down

4 ContributorsI Knew You That Way Lyrics
The secret way long shadows bleed into the night
The Desperate way leaves in the fall hold colors tight
The way that thunder knows the taste of summer rain
I knew you that way
The way that cool mountain water dances down to the sea
Bound by something strong but still so wild and free
It gives into the passion of the pair that takes
I knew you that way

I held you closer than I had a right to hold
But the only thing that time can't take away
Is I knew you that way

The way that skin on skin can start a crazy fire
That no one sees but burns all night long with desire
The quiet easing love that makes a woman want to stay
I knew you that way

I held you closer than I had a right to hold
But the only thing that time can't take away
Is I knew you that way

The holy way that love knows it should never end
The sacred way that stars got sailors home again
Like teardrops know the words to amazing grace
I knew you that way
I knew you that way
I knew you that way

7 ContributorsSouthern and Slow Lyrics
I need to find a country station where the DJ's heart is breakin'
Playin' Jones and Merle and Waylon  all damn day
I'm so sick of doin' ninety, need a road that's so damn windy
It leads to somewhere no one finds this Chevrolet

I need slow and southern like a Sunday
Like muddy water rollin' by a riverbank
Like some sleepy little town, down with the moon
Livin' like honey drippin' off a spoon
Like the sun that takes an hour to get behind the water tower
'Bout the speed of watchin' wildflowers grow
Ain't but two ways this old boy's gonna go
Slow and southern, southern and slow

Yeah, I'm over wild-ass women
Gеttin' gone in a New York minute
Aw, but girl, somеthin' tells me that ain't you (That ain't you)
I wanna take my sweet time, like the slow buzz of that sweet shine
Nothin' keeps me high quite like you do (Like you do)

When you love me slow and southern like a Sunday
Like muddy water rollin' by a riverbank
Like some sleepy little town, down with the moon
Livin' like honey drippin' off a spoon
Like the sun that takes an hour to get behind the water tower
'Bout the speed of watchin' wildflowers grow
Ain't but two ways this old boy's gonna go
Slow and southern, southern and slow, southern and slow
Southern and slow, yeah

Woah, woah, girl, right now that's all I needed
Woah, whoa, just take me there and keep it

Slow and southern like a Sunday
Like muddy water rollin' by a riverbank
Like some sleepy little town, down with the moon
Livin' like honey drippin' off a spoon
Like the sun that takes an hour to get behind the water tower
'Bout the speed of watchin' wildflowers grow
Ain't but two ways this old boy's gonna go
Slow and southern, southern and slow, yeah
Southern and slow

Time is tight and money's short
River's up and the weatherman
He's calling for another storm
Pressure's on, the margins thin
Got to figure out a fix for this awful fix I'm in
Oh Mama, what am I going to do
She said, "Child there's only one thing you can do"

Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything
Pray about everything

Love is blind, fate don't care
Lose your grip
And your balloons go sailing off into the air
Oh Mama, what am I going to do
She said, "Child, there’s only one thing you can do"

Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything
Pray about everything

Yeah take a walk, take a breath, oh give it all a rest
Take a cane pole to the fishing hole and catch a couple fish
And just like that toss them back and make a little wish

Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout it stress about it, fret about it
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything
Yeah, pray about everything

She likes to watch him out the window
Goin’ ‘round in circles under the sun
Somethin’ ‘bout a man on a tractor
With his hat on backwards
Lookin’ forward to after he’s done

He keeps his eye on the back porch
She walks out, kicks off her shoes
Bare feet standin’ in the short grass
Sweet ice tea in a tall glass
Judgin’ by her smile, it’s about time to

Shut it down
Lotta work left to do, the sun’s still out
But any hay to make can wait for now
Throttle back, drop the plow
Shut it down

He wipes his face off with his t-shirt
Climbs down and meets her by the gate
Takes himself a long, cool sip
Lays some sugar on her lips
Thinkin’ maybe he oughta just call it a day

Shut it down
Lotta work left to do, the sun’s still out
Any hay to make can wait for now
Take it on in the house
Shut it down

Ooh, big, blue sky, half-plowed field
Bird on a fender, tractor sittin’ still

Any hay to make can wait for now
Take it on in the house
Close the door, lock it out, lock it out
Shut it down, shut it down, shut it down
Shut it down

[Song 128: Better Than My Heart]
4 ContributorsBetter Than My Heart Lyrics
I'm feeling kind of banged up
Slow out of the bed
Neon noise and honkey-tonk wine ringing in my head
Last night I saw your car
I overheard your name
Pulled my hat down low, wouldn't want you to know I was in this shape

Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart

You filled it with your love
Then you drained it out
Sometimes I think you built it up
Just to break it down
Now all that's really left
Is an emptiness inside
A river running cold, memories growing old
Dying right there on the vine

Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart

Yeah, they're still doing better
Better than my heart
Better than my heart

Realtree wrappin' paper, red ribbon 'round the box
Pulled 'em out, and I put 'em on, couldn't tell you what else I got
Yeah, I thought I was ten-foot tall, runnin' 'round the living room
If you ask me, the best thing anybody could ever do

Buy a boy a pair of boots, he'll wear 'em 'til he wears 'em out
He won't know it yet, but he's a step ahead 'fore they ever hit the ground
Watch him put 'em on and see the man he grows into
Buy a boy a pair of boots

He'll dance 'em like he's got two left ones, keep the right one full of lead
Kick up dust on a Friday night with the worst part of his Sunday best
He'll be shakin' in 'em while he's waitin' in 'em as she walks down wearin' that white
For better or worse, he'll kick 'em off by hers for the rest of his life

Buy a boy a pair of boots, he'll wear 'em till he wears 'em out
He won't know it yet, but he's a step ahead 'fore they ever hit the ground
Watch him put 'em on and see the man he grows into
Buy a boy a pair of boots

First thing I did when I found out he was on the way
Is drove my truck to the country store, picked out them baby snakes
Eighty-somethin' dollars on the counter, a couple tears in my eyes
Yeah, I knew right then how Daddy felt when he bought mine

Buy a boy a pair of boots, he'll wear 'em till he wears 'em out
He won't know it yet, but he's a step ahead 'fore they ever hit the ground
Watch him put 'em on and see the man he grows into
Buy a boy a pair of boots
Buy a boy a pair of boots

Tell you how I’m going to take your cares away

You make me want to roll down the river and around the bend
Love you like a story with a happy ending
You make me want to

You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I’m always running away
I don’t know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to

You make me want to hang up the phone ride across town
Walk through you door and lay it down
Kiss you ‘til you feel the truth
You make me want to

You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I’m always running away
I don’t know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to

Well I never met a girl like you
That’s got me thinking like I do
To hang up my hat and kick off my boots
But you make me want to

2 ContributorsI’m Hungover Lyrics
Grabbed my phone, rolled outta bed
Went back through all the texts I sent
Half-drunk beer on my nightstand
And a red club stamp on my right hand
Tripped on my boots walking down the hall
Chugging sink water, staring at the wall
Trying to put the pieces back together again
Who did how, what, where and when?

Oh hell yeah my head hurts
I got whiskey and lip gloss on my new shirt
All I know is we went out and done it up right
I rode a bull, did a keg stand, shot gunned a beer can, jumped in and broke up a fight
Now it's Saturday morning, I'm hangover, but damn what a Friday night

I think I left my debit card at the bar
Think I took a kiss a little too far
Who's that sleeping on my couch?
I got to whole lot of drunk drama left to sort out

Oh hell yeah my head hurts
I got whiskey and lip gloss on my new shirt
All I know is we went out and done it up right
I rode a bull, did a keg stand, shot gunned a beer can, jumped in and broke up a fight
Now it's Saturday morning, I'm hangover, but damn what a Friday night


Oh hell yeah my head hurts
Now that I come to think about it this aren’t my shirt
All I know is I went out and done it up right
Got in a fight with my girlfriend, threw down my beer can, and still had the time of my life
Now it's Saturday morning, I'm hangover, but damn what a Friday night

Yeah, yeah now it's Saturday morning, I'm hangover, but damn what a Friday night
Man what a Friday night

Sooner or later somebody's gonna take you home

Are you leaving with him?

You can sit there letting time pass
Looking at your nails, staring down in your glass
Or you can just look up my way
See me wanting you, written on my face
I ain't gonna tell you what you wanna do
Cause you gonna do what you wanna do

Are you leaving with him?

You take a sip and we locked eyes

Are you leaving with him?

I aren’t been doing to right
Since I met her last night
Some kind of burning breakfast
Lost at work state of mind
We're meeting here because
She mentioned that she loves
This kind of sushi, veggie, raw and edgy natural stuff
But I'm feeling out of place
But baby's on the way

I'm just boots and a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweating heavy
Something she's got got me feeling like this
All I got to do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way

Aren’t going to try those lines
Been used so many times
Like "when you fell from heaven did it hurt and did you cry?"
I'm just going to wear this smile
Sit back and talk a while
Pull a few questions from my get to know her better file
Hey it’s a real good day
Cause baby's on the way

I'm just boots and a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweating heavy
Something she's got got me feeling like this
All I got to do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way
Oh, yeah yeah

It's just a simple case of can't wait
Got to be great to see her again
Got to be tough to hide what's inside
And in my eyes when she walks in

I'm just boots and a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweating heavy
Something she's got got me feeling like this
All I got to do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way

Hey, yeah, my baby's on the way
Yeah, yeah, baby's on the way

[Song 134: The Sand I Brought to the Beach]
4 ContributorsThe Sand I Brought to the Beach Lyrics
Real sad story here y'all
Come on

I pulled her into my ride
And we rode down here
Maybe some sun, maybe some quality time
We've had a rocky year
She wasn't ready for me jumping on the bar
And buying everybody them shots
While I was burning up my credit card
She was burning cars out in the parking lot

I think I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Somebody drink one with me
Oh, cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach

Oh well looks like I've done it again
I ran another one off
Maybe I'm better off a single man
At least down here Panama City
Now that I'm free for the rest of the week
Feel free to tag alone
Whatever y'all need, yeah, it's on me
So here's to me doing whatever the hell I want

Cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Y'all drink one with me
Oh, cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach

I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess I can't control the Spring Break side of me
A ride home from my boys now is all I need
Cause I just lost the sand I brought to the
Yeah I lost the sand I brought to the
Yes I've lost the sand I brought to the beach

[Song 135: Corner Booth]
4 ContributorsCorner Booth Lyrics
Place is packed, having a blast
Take a sip, leave a tip, get to throwing them back
Nothing but a few beers, on my mind
Then the door swings open, I looked left
You in that red dress, dagger through my chest
There goes my good time

Where's a corner booth when I need one?
A little spot I can hide where the neon don't hit me
Making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me
All I want to find me is a waitress to pour me up a shot of
Forget this damn night, and everything we've ever done
Where's a corner booth when I need one?

It'd just make it worse, if you knew it hurt
And seen me sneaking out the backdoor now
Looks like I'll be hanging around
I try not to stare, or wonder if you care
Hell, I don't even know if you know I'm here
Or that I'm dodging you through the crowd

Where's a corner booth when I need one?
A little spot I can hide where the neon don't hit me
Making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me
All I want to find me is a waitress to pour me up a shot of
Forget this damn night, and everything we've ever done
Where's a corner booth when I need one?

Maybe one in the back with the seat torn
Where the smokes so thick you can't even see the dancefloor
Cause, I know you're on the dancefloor baby

Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide where the neon don't hit me
Making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me
All I want to find me is a waitress to pour me up a shot of
Forget this damn night, and everything we've ever done
Where's a corner booth when I need one?
When I need one

3 ContributorsJust a Sip Lyrics
What gives you courage to walk up to a ten in a bar
What turns the nervous into a rock star
What gets you through the week then
And right on through the weekend
And puts you back together again

Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Going to be mm so good, mm so nice
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip

What makes a good old boy start pumping his fist in the sky
What makes a shy girl walk on the wild side
What makes a party better
Makes it last forever
Everybody all together now

Take a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Going to be mm so good, mm so nice
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip

You can chug it down all you want
But you aren’t going to last long
Trust me you can get there with

Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Going to be mm so good, mm so right
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip

Taking one of them big old sips

Drop it boys

I say hey man
What you doing later on?
He said aw man
I'm just hanging out later on
I said I'll swing by and get you
And you'll be there and I bet you
We can find a little something to do a little later on
I say "Hey man"
What's Jr. and them doing later on?
He said "aww man"
He's got to check on his momma and them later on
So it looks like you and me
So let's ride around and see
If we can find a little bit of trouble a little later on
Come on!

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're going to drink up a lot of beer a little later on
Going to find a good spot
Crank up a few songs
We're going to get on outta here a little later on
You know out in the country don't make no plans
Throw it out there, see where it lands
Rocking out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on

I said hey girl
What you doing later on?
She said
I'm getting off work later on
I said call a couple of your friends
Cause me and my buddy Ben
We're going to be back by to get you a little later on
Ha-ha yeah

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're going to drink up a lot of beer a little later on
Going to find a good spot
Crank up a few songs
We're going to get on outta here a little later on
You know out in the country don't make no plans
Grab a pretty girl, take her by the hand
Rocking out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on

Meet up with you little bit, little bit, little bit later on
Come on now a little bit, little bit, little bit later on
We're going to break it all down to the break of dawn
A little bit, little bit, little bit later on

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're going to drink up a lot of beer a little later on
We're going to do it up right
All night long
Going to worry 'bout tomorrow a little later on
You know out in the country don't make no plans
Find a little bar with a guitar band
Rocking out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on
A little bit later on

Lay a little bit of rubber down on some asphalt
50 yard line, better not get our butts caught
A little bit later on
Find a little spot right down on the creek bank
Really don't care what your momma and daddy might think
A little bit later on
A little bit later on

[Song 138: I Did It Again]
5 ContributorsI Did It Again Lyrics
It took me and four of my buddies
Half the night to pull out my truck
I stood there and proclaimed everybody
It's the last time I'll mess with this mud
The boys they all grinned and two nights from then

I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do, I did it again

I took my first sip of cold beer
And tried not to spit it back up
I set it back down on that tailgate
Told myself I'd had enough
Then like a real man I took hold of that can

And I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do, I did it again

I guess, I'm a slow learner, I ought to know better
Than to do what I do, but I aren’t no quitter

The other night we got a little rowdy
I woke up with one eye swole shut
Yeah, things got out of hand at that party
I said, "That's it, it's 'bout time I grow up"
But that next weekend, I called all my friends

And I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do

Yeah, what any old country boy'd do
I did it again, I did it again
I done, done it again, I did it again

[Song 139: Love in a College Town]
2 ContributorsLove in a College Town Lyrics
Girl, I’ll be over there
With my buddies drinking beer
If you need me, come and get me
When you hear our song
In a little while
When you’re ready shoot me that smile
That way I’ll know, that its time to go
You got your buzz on

We won’t ever look as good as we do now
So let’s take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Nothing like love in a college town

All the rumors fly
Did you hear who hooked up last night?
Thought she was all about, cause all she talked about
Was some old boy back home
There’s old what’s-his-name
He just can’t seem to graduate
Hitting on the new crop, buying them lemon drops
Man that’s just wrong!

We won’t ever look as good as we do now
So let’s take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Feels like love in a college town

I’m going to fail this test
Thinking ‘bout your dress
Laying on my floor
Running out the door
A-A-B-A-C, that sounds good to me!

We won’t ever look as good as we do now
So let’s give it one more shot
Baby how’s that sound?
Hug on one another, kiss on each other
In the morning we can chalk it down
As love in a college town

Got to love love in a college town

[Song 140: I Do All My Dreamin’ There]
4 ContributorsI Do All My Dreamin’ There Lyrics
You know I got me a spot somewhere
Come on

There's a little place down an overgrown road
Nobody but me and the whole world knows
Been going there ever since I was a kid
On my red dirt bike with my blue tick Sid
Spent a lotta long summer nights
With the hoot owls and the satellites
Ain't the kind of place that I ever shared
But come on with me, let me take you where

I do my bobber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eating
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughing
Just talking to the man in the sky
Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut-offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there!

There's a big oak on the other side
Where I took my grandpa's pocket knife
And I carved their names with tears in my eyes
When he joined grandma in the by and by
Got it right here in the dashboard box
Tip broke off and the blade don't lock
But I bet it'd carve our names just fine
If you wanna come along with me next time

I do my bobber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eating
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughing
Just talking to the man in the sky
Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut-offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there!

Yeah, I've done some bobber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eating
Watching the world going by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughing
Just talking to the big man in the sky

Baby, jump on in, there's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut-offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there!

Right there, ha ha ha!

[Song 142: Tackle Box]
6 ContributorsTackle Box Lyrics
It was two shades of brown, scratched-up plastic
It held extra line, lures, hooks, and matches
And his last name engraved in black
Right there by the handle on the top
I'd slide it out of the back of his station wagon
Lug it down the bank with my arm dragging
And I could hardly wait for him
To lift the lid on that tackle box

Cause I'd sail with him across the South Pacific
Stand beside him on the bow of that battleship
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus
And watch him run to Grandma, crying on the dock
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box

He'd bait my hook and keep on telling stories
'Bout nickel Cokes, girls, and sandlot glories
Pickup trucks and golden fields
Long before this town knew blacktop

I was almost riding with him shotgun down those dirt roads
Taking turns on a jug of homemade shine
As he raced his buddies down through Mason Holler
Filling the sky with dust and kicked up rocks
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box

He's been gone twenty years tomorrow
And I'm still holding on to one wish
That God above could let me borrow Grandpa
For one more afternoon and one more fish

And I'd sail with him across the South Pacific
Stand beside him on the bow of that battleship
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus
And watch him run to Grandma, crying on the dock
He'd open up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box

Everything he loved he kept locked up in that old tackle box
It was two shades of brown scratched up plastic

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, o holy night
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, o holy night

You're shakin’ like a live oak leaf, missin' your first deer
Seven years old, fighting back the tears
Next thing you know, it's your senior year
Sayin’ you can't wait 'til you're out of here
Wintergreen Skoal in a console cup
Cut a bunch of yards so you can jack it up
Spinnin' them wheels in your Chevrolet
Diggin' down deep in the Georgia clay

My girl in a 12-foot boat, blue eyes and a red sunset
Headin' down some way backroad, back tires still soakin' wet
Wind blowin’ that cloud of dust, plow disc all worn and rusty
Runnin’ wide-open on empty, yeah, that was life
Back when life was a new country song
It was duck dogs and football
We didn't have much, but we had it all
Tryna stеal a kiss and put a fish on the wall

Now I’m watchin' my boys backlash a line
The muscadinе don't fall far from the vine
Spinner bait hung in a cypress tree
Man, I swear they're just like me
When it was

My girl in a 12-foot boat, blue eyes and a red sunset
Headin’ down some way backroad, back tires still soakin' wet
Wind blowin' that cloud of dust, plow disc all worn and rusty
Runnin' wide-open on empty, yeah, that was life
Back when life was a new country song
It was duck dogs and football
We didn't have much, but we had it all
Tryna steal a kiss and put a fish on the wall

Man, it's somethin' to see, them holdin' up their first ten-pounder
And if they're lucky as me, they'll catch and thank the Lord you found her

My girl in a 12-foot boat, blue eyes and a red sunset
Headin' down some way backroad, back tires still soakin' wet
Wind blowin' that cloud of dust, plow disc all worn and rusty
Runnin' wide-open on empty, yeah, that was life
Back when life was a new country song
It was duck dogs and football
We didn't have much, but we had it all
Tryna steal a kiss and put a fish on the wall

We didn't have much, but we had it all
Tryna steal a kiss and put a fish on the wall

Back again in the back of this pasture
Sweatin' bad in the cab of this tractor
I oughta be worried about the rain
The last hundred rows could've been a little straighter
Guess I'll be hittin' them again later
I could turn this red dirt all day, yeah

Dreamin' 'bout sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips

Behind the dust is a big ol' blue sky
Kinda reminds me of those blue eyes smilin' back at me
I slide up a gear and go a little faster
Just a little breeze and I'm right back there
And I can almost feel

Her sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips
Oh, sunburnt lips, sunburnt lips, sunburnt lips
Sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And one sweet, sweet memory of layin' on the beach
With her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips
Sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips

Seems all we got left is Friday and Saturday night and sometimes Sunday if Monday is a holiday
I got a bunch of buddies I aren’t seen in a while
I got some good-time fun and hot dog buns in a stock pile
With some home brew
Malibu and Miller Lite
Girl put on that short little party dress
And make me a little bit Jealous

Been on the phone with all my friends
There’s a little spot in the river bend where the sun sits high
Long as the keg don’t float and the ice don’t melt
We’ll loosen up a notch on the Bible belt

Girl you can bet we’ll fall in love again and again and again
It’s going to be a wild, wild, wild weekend

It's Friday afternoon and the countdowns on, cell phone's singing that

Bad to the bone ringtone, come on, come on, come on

Put in this mornin' at first light
Had a biscuit on my way down
I was sittin' there waitin' on the first bite
From a rainbow or a brown
Anchor down at the bridge, gonna try a new midge
There was traffic flyin' by
Taillights glowin' red, thirty feet overhead
But it felt like a thousand miles

I'm just floatin' this creek and takin' it slow
Tryna catch somethin' big, sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today
'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it on in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me
Floatin' this creek

That rush hour traffic kinda slowed down
'Bout the time that the fish did too
Just me and this ol' green boat now
Nothin' but nothin' to do
So I broke out a cold one, called my buddies, told 'em
Slippеd up and caught a state record
That's a little whitе lie, he was good eatin' size
But I like my story better

I'm just floatin' this creek and takin' it slow
Tryna catch somethin' big and sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today
'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it all in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me
Yeah, I'm just floatin' this creek

Put my boat back on the trailer, eased out on the blacktop
Kinda sucks but I gotta make a dollar
I'm feeling pretty good, so I won't bitch
'Cause in the morning when I'm diggin' that ditch

I'll be floatin' this creek and taking it slow
Tryna catch somethin' big and sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today
'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it all in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me

It was the last night at the Holiday Inn
There was a fire on the beach
I was trying to talk to some other girl
And she was bird-dogging me
I finally had enough
I pulled over to the side
Brushed her hair back and looked her straight in the eye

It was a spring break-up
Baby don't cry
You aren’t from here and neither am I
I know we got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye

No I don't need your number
Don't want to be your Facebook friend
I hate to break it to you
But you won't ever see me again
If I'm a bad guy, well I don't mean to be
But there's a beach full of buddies
Acting just like me

Spring break-up
Baby don't cry
You aren’t from here and neither am I
I know we got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye

Bye bye to the night that we shared
The memories we made on that old beach chair
So long to the beer in that kiss
Hope it don't take you long to get over this

Spring break-up
Baby don't cry
You aren’t from here and neither am I
I know we got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up

Spring break-up
Baby don't cry
You aren’t from here and neither am I
We got a little drunk
And we had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up

And watched all my friends

All been together
And tried to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So lift 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good like we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever

This ain't the first time we've partied under these stars
Making a hangover
Well, this time I got a few more songs in this old guitar
For you to pull your baby closer
Y'all pull your baby closer


There's something in this spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up right...
Let's do it up right...
