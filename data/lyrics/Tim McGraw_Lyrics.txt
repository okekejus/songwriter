You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleepin' with someone
And sleepin' with someone you love
"I love you" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind (Yeah)

When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin', don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind

Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh, baby

The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
You're trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

Johnny's daddy was taking him fishing
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holding a fishing pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, "We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday, you'll change your mind"

And Johnny said

Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Beau
Take anybody that you want
As long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips
In front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, "If you do what I tell you to
There won't be any harm"

And Johnny said

Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one
And she says, "It's time to go"
Doctor says, "The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his mama's fading fast"
And Johnny hit his knees

And there, he prayed

Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please, don't take the girl

Johnny's daddy was taking him fishing
When he was eight years old

Runnin' 'round in this new truck
Bank lets me borrow from month to month
I'm runnin' out of credit, find a little cash on the radio
Standin' still they're blowin' past, numbers on cars goin' NASCAR fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know?
'Cause where I come from only the horses run
When the day is done we take it easy

Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here

'Cause meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

Oh I miss, yeah, a little dirt on the road, I miss corn growin' in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows, there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town routes, walkin' around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof
It's time we head on back

'Cause meanwhile back at Mama's
The for sale sign's goin' up and I'm gonna
Dump this truck and the little I got
On a loan to own and a three-acre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge
Goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich
Watch the sun settin' on the ridge
Baby tell me what you think about this

Me and you back at Mama's
Yeah, me and you back at Mama's

She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklins
She wants Aretha
She don't really care how you're spending your money
It's all how you treat her
She just want a friend to be there
When she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying

'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with the lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl

She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind
She just want to feel that you're real
That she's near to the man that's inside
She don't need to hear she's a queen on a throne
That she's more than amazing
She just wants you to say what you mean and to mean everything that you're saying

'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with a lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl

That's how you speak to, speak to her
That's how you speak to, speak to her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with a lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world

You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you talk to a woman

Slow, fast, full speed
Girl where ever sweet time takes us
Hang, with me down this old road
Only God knows where we'll go
Don't matter long as I've got your love

I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
With another voice calling me "baby"
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up
For a dinner on a Friday night
I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no
No other shotgun rider beside me
Singin' to the radio, ooo, oo

Slide, slide over nice and close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
You can fall asleep, I'll let you
Dream, life ain't nothing but a dream
Don't wanna be, cruisin' through this dream without you

I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me "baby"
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up

No I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no
No other shotgun rider beside me

I want to drink that shot of whiskey
I want to smoke that cigarette
I want to smell that sweet addiction on my breath
I want to ride across West Virginia in the backseat of a Cadillac
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you

Like a needle needs a vein
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son meet the holy ghost
I need you
I want to get lost in some corner booth
Cantina Mexico
I want to dance to the static of an a.m. radio
I want to wrap the moon around us and lay beside you skin on skin
Make love 'til the sun comes up til the sun goes down again
'Cause I need you

Like a needle needs a vein
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son meet the holy ghost
I need you
Oh, I need you

I want to drink that shot of whiskey
I want to smoke that cigarette
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you, oh, I need you

13 ContributorsIf You’re Reading This Lyrics
If you're reading this, my Momma's sitting there
Looks like I only got a one-way ticket over here
Sure wish I could give you one more kiss
And war was just a game we played when we were kids

I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you

So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home

If you're reading this
Halfway around the world
I won’t be there
To see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you
I hope she fights like me
Stand up for the innocent and the weak

I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
Tell dad I don't regret that I followed in his shoes

So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home

If you're reading this
There’s going to come a day
When you'll move on
And find someone else
And that's OK
Just remember this
I'm in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace
And angels sing amazing grace

So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
If you're reading this
I'm already home

11 ContributorsTop of the World LyricsMcGraw debuted the first single from his TBA album on August 4th, 2015. Prior to the track’s release, he chatted with astronaut Scott Kelly via Twitter.
We could have a little double wide planted in an empty field
We could have a big old white picket wrap around on a hill
Don't make a difference to me baby, where the wind takes me, long as I'm with you, girl
We could have something or nothing, still be sitting on top of the world

'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view

Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world

We could be rolling on a couple of Goodyears and painted rust
We could be strolling barefoot in the sand, in the setting sun
Yeah, any way you kiss me flips me and gets me the right kind of tipsy, girl
We could be somewhere or nowhere and still be sitting on top of the world

'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view

Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be

15 ContributorsJust to See You Smile Lyrics
You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from bein' made of gold
I don't know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no
Just like when you were leavin' Amarillo
Takin' that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
'Cause leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face
And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance I'd lie again

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

[Song 11: Back When]
15 ContributorsBack When Lyrics
Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Do not happen much anymore

We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life

Back when a ho was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played 'em all
Country, soul and rock-n-roll
What happened to those times

I am reading Street Slang For Dummies
'Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then

Back when a ho was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

Give me a flat top for strummin'
I want the whole world to be hummin'
Oh, just keep it comin'
The way it was back then

Back when a ho was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

I miss back when
I miss back when

And I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin' 'til you walked into my life
It was a feeling I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover, there could never be another to make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer, I fall in love all over every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh, yeah

You stand by me and you believe in me like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy, you're right there to save me, you make me see how much I have
And I still tremble when we touch
And, oh, the look in your eyes when we make love

You're more than a lover, there could never be another to make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer, I fall in love all over every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me

I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby, she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

All my friends call me Bear Claw
The village chieftain is my paw-paw
He gets his orders from my maw-maw
She makes him walk the line
You can find me in my wigwam
I'll be beatin' on my tom-tom
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some
Hey, and pass it around

'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby, she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

I ain't lookin' for trouble
We can ride my pony double
Make your little heart bubble
Lord, like a glass of wine
I remember the medicine man
He caught Running Water in my hands
Drug me around by my headband
Said I wasn't her kind

'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby, she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

I can kill a deer or buffalo
With just my arrow and my hickory bow
From a hundred yards, don't you know?
I do it all the time
They all gather 'round my tipi
Late at night, tryin' to catch a peek at me
In nothin' but my buffalo briefs
I got them standin' in line

'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby, she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

Cherokee people, Cherokee tribe
So proud to live, so proud to die

Don't think I can keep it all in

And who I am now is who I wanted to be
And now that we're together, I'm stronger than ever

Don't think I can keep it all in, no
And if you asked me why I changed

[Song 15: Something Like That]
14 ContributorsSomething Like That Lyrics
It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor’s sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Coming from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away

I had a barbecue stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don’t forget, no a heart don’t forget
I said a heart don’t forget something like that
Oh, not something like that

[Song 16: My Little Girl]
15 ContributorsMy Little Girl Lyrics
Gotta hold on easy as I let you go
Gonna tell you how much I love you
Though you think you already know
I remember I thought you looked like an angel wrapped in pink so soft and warm
You've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born

You're beautiful, baby, from the outside in
Chase your dreams, but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be my little girl

When you were in trouble, that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone
Now look at you, I've turned around, and you've almost grown
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper, "I love you" in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say, "Daddy, love you more"

You're beautiful, baby, from the outside in
Chase your dreams, but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be my little girl

Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand
But I won't say, "Yes" to him unless I know he's the half
That makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me, he won't be good enough!

You're beautiful, baby, from the outside in
Chase your dreams, but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be my little girl

[Song 17: Keep Your Eyes On Me]
12 ContributorsKeep Your Eyes On Me Lyrics
Ain't it just like a tear
To go and blur out everything
Ain't it just like glass
To fall and break so easily
Ain't it just like love
To leave a mark on the skin and underneath
Yeah, when the pain goes and shadows everything

Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
When it hurts too much to see
Keep your eyes on me

Ain't it the sinner
Who gets all the grace sometimes
Ain't it the saint
Who picks up the pieces left behind
Yeah, and it's human to hurt the one
You hurt the one you love the most
And you can't find the sun

Keep your eyes on me
<¡>When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When the light in your heart is
Too burned out to see
Keep your eyes on me

You swear you're all alone sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
And you can't find your way home sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me

Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When you can't find your way home
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me

Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm takin' out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
I'm crossin' my fingers and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

Gotta wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa, she'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

Yeah, I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

Come on, baby
You know what I like
Yeah, I like that
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Hey, don't forget to turn out the lights

[Song 19: Standing Room Only]
8 ContributorsStanding Room Only Lyrics
I get so mad at things that don't matter way too much
I let the way back whens and my old friends scatter like they were dust
I get to chasin' that rainbow pot of gold right into the pourin' rain
With nothin' to show for it, standin' there soakin' wet
Lookin' up, shakin' my fist as the thunder rolls
Now and then on nights like this, I catch a thunderbolt

I wanna live a life, live a life
Like a dollar and the clock on the wall don't own me
Shine a light, shine a light
Like mama's front porch when I'm lost and lonely
Start forgivin' and start forgettin'
Be somebody that's worth rememberin'
Live a life so when I die
There's standing room only, standing room only
Standing room only, standing room only

I wanna take my grudges and my old regrets, and let 'em go
I wanna learn how to say a lot more yes and a lot less no
Girl, I wanna dance and shout and love out loud, and come alive
Don't wanna be the guy too cool to laugh and too scared to cry

I wanna live a life, live a life
Like a dollar and the clock on the wall don't own me
Shine a light, shine a light
Like mama's front porch when I'm lost and lonely
Start forgivin' and start forgettin'
Be somebody that's worth rememberin'
Live a life so when I die
There's standing room only, standing room only


Stop judging my life by my possessions
Start thinking 'bout how many headlights will be in my procession

I wanna live a life, live a life
Like a dollar and the clock on the wall don't own me
Shine a light, shine a light
Like mama's front porch when I'm lost and lonely
Start forgivin' and start forgettin'
Be somebody that's worth rememberin'
Live a life so when I die
There's standing room only, standing room only

Standing room only, standing room only
Standing room only, standing room only
Standing room only, standing room only

[Song 20: I Called Mama]
8 ContributorsI Called Mama Lyrics
Got a call from a friend about a friend
With some news no one ever wants to hear
It hit me like a punch, it took my breath
He was just gettin' into his best years
Yeah, somethin' like that'll shake you up
Wake you up

So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama

It rang a couple times, and she picked up
I can always hear her smile when I call
I just called to tell you that I loved you
I was missing you and dad and home, that's all
I got to really thinking this morning
About what's important

So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama

And from now on
I ain't gonna wait so long

To stop off at a Texaco, buy a Slim Jim and a coke
Park out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grab my guitar from the back seat, write a song just for me
Sing it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I think of home, grab my phone from my pocket
Instead of sayin' tomorrow, I'm gonna
And I called mama
And I called mama

[Song 21: Red Ragtop]
13 ContributorsRed Ragtop Lyrics
I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just about as wild as we were green in the ways of the world
Well, she picked me up in that red ragtop
We were free of the folks and hidin' from the cops
On a summer night, runnin' all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove
And the night was as hot as a coal burnin' stove
We were cooking with gas
Knew it had to last

In the back of that red ragtop
She said, "Please, don't stop"

Well, the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother to be
For two weeks (Ooh)
I was out of a job and she was in school
And life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild (Ooh)
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down, there would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red ragtop
She said, "Please, don't stop
Loving me"

We took one more trip around the sun
But it was all make believe in the end (In the end)
No, I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then

Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time, drive you out of your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
And I was in an old scene

I was back in that red ragtop
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red ragtop
On the day she stopped
Loving me

[Song 22: Thought About You]
6 ContributorsThought About You Lyrics
Saw a young Mama laughin' talkin' on the phone
With a little girl workin' on an ice cream cone
Drippin' on her shoes
And I thought about you

Saw a spring break Honda hell-bent for Daytona
The boys in the back hiding their Corona
Like kids do
And I thought about you

I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you

I saw "hungry" misspelled on a cardboard sign
And a dirty t-shirt that said "Roll Tide"
So I gave him a few
And I thought about you

Ran into a buddy, he said "How long's it been?"
I said "A couple years," he said "Boy, it's been ten"
That's what time'll do
And I thought about you

I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you
I thought about you

I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

I saw a red balloon somebody just let fly
I watched it gettin' smaller up in the sky
For a minute or two
And I thought about you

[Song 23: Undivided]
7 ContributorsUndivided Lyrics
You see, Billy got picked on at school
For things he couldn't change
He tried his best to play it cool
But in the seventh grade
You either fit right in or you don't fit
That's just the cold hard truth
I wish that I'd have been the friend
That Billy never knew

I think it's time to come together
You and I can make a change
Maybe we can make a difference
Make the world a better place
Look around and love somebody
We've been hateful long enough
Let the Good Lord reunite us
'Til this country that we love's
Undivided (Yup)

You either go to church or you're gonna go to Hell
Get a job and work or you're gonna go to jail
I just kinda wish we didn't think like that
Why's it gotta be all white or all black?
And when we gon' learn to try on someone's shoes sometimes? (That's right)
And when we gon' start to see from someone else's eyes?

I think it's time to come together
You and I can make a change
Maybe we can make a difference
Make the world a better place
Look around and love somebody
We've been hateful long enough
Let the Good Lord reunite us
'Til this country that we love's
Undivided
Oh, yeah
Undivided, oh yeah

We're all the same to God
No matter what we get His love
I'm tired of lookin' left or right
So I'm just lookin' up

I think it's time to come together
You and I can make a change
Maybe we can make a difference
Make the world a better place
Look around and love somebody
We've been hateful long enough (Hateful long enough)
Let the Good Lord reunite us
'Til this country that we love's
Undivided (Come on)
Oh yeah
Undivided, oh yeah

(You either go to church or you're gonna go to Hell)
Oh yeah
(Get a job and work or you're gonna go to jail)
Undivided
(I just kinda wish we didn't think like that)
Yep
Why's it gotta be all white or all black?

[Song 24: The Rest of Our Life]
9 ContributorsThe Rest of Our Life Lyrics
Sitting with you in a dark room
Warmed by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope I say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life?

There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

I've been making plans for children
Since I've been looking in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter'd be Rose
Son, it'd be Ryan

There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worrying about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

I don't really care about those storm clouds brewing
Oh, as long as you're here by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old

Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you
We'll stay young for the rest of our life

[Song 25: Where the Green Grass Grows]
13 ContributorsWhere the Green Grass Grows Lyrics
Six lanes, taillights
Red ants marchin' into the night
They disappear to the left and right again
Another supper from a sack
A ninety-nine cent heart attack
I got a poundin' head and an achin' back
And the camel's buried in a big straw stack

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

Well I'm from a map dot
A stop sign on a black top
I caught the first bus I could hop from there
But all of this glitter is a-gettin' dark
There's concrete growin' in the city park
I don't know who my neighbors are
And there's bars on the corners and bars on my heart

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watchin' my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

Got an '06, stick shift
Dark blue F150 in good condition
Got a hundred and nineteen thousand miles
Only five on the new transmission

It's got leather seats, a sun roof
It's sittin' on thirty-threes, it runs smooth
It'll get you from A to B, but not for me
'Cause every time I turn that key, I see her

Shotgun ridin' down a two-lane road
Just drivin' around with no place to go, ah
Singin' along to "Where the Green Grass Grows"
Hands out the window, floatin' on the breeze
She's fixin' her lips in the dropdown mirror
That pretty little thing made it hard to steer
I'm never gonna get her out of there
There's too many memories
Now there's a "For sale" sign in the window
Yeah, 'cause if I'm gonna let her go
I gotta let it go, yeah, it's gotta go
So it's $7500 OBO

Back bumper's got a dent from her backin' in
To a mailbox first time she drove it
Couldn't even be mad with her lookin' like that
Told her, "Hell, you can hardly even notice"

It's got nights with her I can't forget
Kissin' on the tailgate of the truck bed
I wish I didn't have to get rid of it
But every time I turn that key, I see her

Shotgun ridin' down a two-lane road
Just drivin' around with no place to go, ah

8 ContributorsThe Cowboy In Me Lyrics
I don't know why I act the way I do
Like I ain't got a single thing to lose
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
I guess that's just the cowboy in me
I got a life that most would love to have
But sometimes I still wake up fighting mad
At where this road I am heading down might lead
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that's never satisfied
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me
The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that's never satisfied
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

Girl I know there's times you must have thought
There ain't a line you've drawn I haven't crossed
But you set your mind to see this love on through
I guess that's just the cowboy in you

We ride and never worry about the fall
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all

I need Jesus or I need whiskey
Whatever works best to get me through
Gettin' over you
A little Friday night hallelujah
A congregation of backsliders just like me
Yeah, what I need

Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

Baptize me in that barroom smoke
Bartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke no more
Ain't that what this place is for?
I tried bended knee, hands-up prayin'
But damn did that hurt, don't just keep hangin' around
What I need right now

Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

Just a-sippin' down that unholy water
Save that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow
I'll stay here all night
In a neon church
With the party crowd
Where the good times roll
And the music's loud
Instead of home starin' holes in the ceiling
I got a feeling

I need a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church
I need a neon church

Diamond rings and old barstools
One's for queens and one's for fools
One's the future and one's the past
One's forever and one won't last

It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
It ain't like watered down whiskey and Coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools

The wrongs and rights, the highs and lows
The "I love yous," the "I told you sos"
Past few miles to wherever's home
Another morning waking up alone

It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
It ain't like watered down whiskey and Coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools

We ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
Nothing like watered down whiskey and Coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools

10 ContributorsSouthern Girl Lyrics
Now I ain't sayin' them LA ladies don't know what they doing
And I been in love with New York City a time or two
I had some Seattle coffee, some Chicago wind
Some Kansas wheat fields I'd love to see again
But the fireflies play where the cattails grow
And them southern girls, they talk nice and slow with

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long

A southern girl's mama probably taught her how a lady should act
But a southern girl's probably got a barn somewhere reared out back
She'll get a little hay in her hair, her tires in the mud
She's been caught in the rain, and washed in the blood
Likes cherries in her Coke, takes a little sip
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long

If you've ever seen Savannah heat up when the stars come out
Well, then, fellas, come on, you know what I'm talking about

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

Southern girl, rock my world
Put on a country song
Southern girl, rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
We'll dance all night long
Southern girl, rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long
Southern girl, rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long
Southern girl, rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long

When all our tears have reached the sea
Part of you will live in me
Way down deep inside my heart
The days keep coming without fail
A new wind is gonna find your sail
That's where your journey starts

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Just like the waves down by the shore
We're gonna keep on coming back for more
'Cause we don't ever wanna stop
Out in this brave new world you seek
Oh, the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Remember me when you're out walking
When the snow falls high outside your door
Late at night when you're not sleeping
And moonlight falls across your floor
When I can't hurt you anymore

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me
Please remember me

7 ContributorsBreak First Lyrics
Standing at the bar tryin' to get a drink
Got one I hadn't touched at the table
Somebody said you're here, but I ain't gonna leave
Maybe I'll just act like you're a stranger

Do you know how hard it is tryin' to hold a conversation?
Knowin' you're right there across the room
So I don't hear a word that they're sayin'
No, I don't hear a word that they're sayin'

You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
Who's gonna walk up and say "hi"
Then lean in a little close to whose lips
Say, "What the hell are we doin'?"
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?

I'm dancing with a girl, got my eyes closed
Actin' like I'm lost in the music
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is holdin' you close
I don't know how much longer I can do this

Do you know how hard it is bein' in this situation?
Knowing you were everything
And now havin' to act like we're nothing
And pretendin' that I don't still love you

You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
Who's gonna walk up and say "hi"
Then lean in a little close to whose lips
Say, "What the hell are we doin'?"
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?

Who's gonna say, "What were we thinkin'?"
Who's gonna cut right through the tension
Who's gonna admit that they miss who worse?
Who's gonna tell who how bad it hurts?

You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?
Who's gonna walk up and say "hi"
Then lean in a little too close to whose lips
Say, "What the hell are we doin'?"
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?

Who's gonna break?
You or me, baby, who's gonna break first?

[Song 34: Everywhere]
6 ContributorsEverywhere Lyrics
We were born in this little town
Growin' up I was countin' down
Every single day
Till we made our getaway

But you said you could never see yourself
Tryin' to make a life anywhere else
This would be your home
And I was on my own

But ever since you said good-bye
I've been out here on the wind
Baby you would be surprised
All the places you have been

I've seen you in Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard
Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sunset in Monterey
Girl, I swear just the other day you were
Down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches
In Carolina, barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you everywhere

Now a days, when I'm passin' through
The conversation always turns to you
And I hear you're doin' fine
Livin' out by the county line

Got a man that's home every night
A couple of kids and the kind of life
That you wanna lead
Guess you could say the same for me

But you and I made our choices
All those years ago
Still I know I'll hear your voice
And see you down the road

Maybe in Oklahoma drivin' 'cross the prairie
In Dallas, Texas isn't that where we
Always said we would like to try?
Never did so maybe that's why you're on
Every highway, just beyond the high-beams
Right beside me in all of my sweet dreams
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you in

Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard
In Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sunset in Monterey
Girl, I swear just the other day you were
Down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches
In Carolina, barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you everywhere

[Song 35: Angry All The Time]
10 ContributorsAngry All The Time Lyrics
Here we are
What is left of a husband and a wife
With four good kids who have a way
Of gettin' on with their lives
And I'm not old
But I'm gettin' a whole lot older every day
It's too late to keep from goin' crazy
I've got to get away

The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
I understand that lovin' a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one
Who feels like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time

Our boys are strong now
The spittin' image of you when you were young
I hope someday they can see past
What you have become
And I remember
Every time I said I'd never leave
But what I can't live with
Is memories of the way you used to be

The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
I understand that lovin' a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one
Who feels like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time


Twenty years have came and went
Since I walked out of your door
I never quite made it back
To the one I was before
And, God, it hurts me to think of you
'Fore the light in your eyes was gone
And sometimes I don't know why
This old world can't leave well enough alone

The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
I understand that lovin' a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one
Who feels like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be
Angry all the time

[Song 36: How I’ll Always Be]
9 ContributorsHow I’ll Always Be Lyrics
I'm a little more beer bottle beer joint than a fancy bar
I'm a little more sitting up high on the road than a little car
I'm a little more bust ya back than take it for free
And that’s how I'll always be
I'm a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
I'm a little more ol' Hank Williams than that trendy crap
I love a flat wood ol' front porch made of an old oak tree
And that's how I'll always be

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

I got friends that say I live a little like Cool Hand Luke
Fast cars and motorcycles, raisin' hell in cowboy boots
But, hey, on Sunday morning, I'll take the back row seat
That's how I'll always be

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

I'm a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender
That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her
Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin' down
Handshake deals, fresh-cut hay fields, and hometowns

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

Daddies meet mommies
On a Saturday night
Buy 'em a Corona
In the blink of an eye
There's a ring on her finger
They're throwin' parking lot rice
And you're standin' in the kitchen
And there's two pink lines
Nine months later, you're breathin'
And you're the reason
They're here on Earth

It's like we open our eyes
For the very first time
When we find out why
We're here on Earth
Here on Earth
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

The drunks get sober
And poets get drunk
The wonder years wander
Guitars get strummed
We all need dreams worth dreamin'
Somethin' to believe in
Here on Earth
(Here on Earth, here on Earth, here on Earth)

It's like we open our eyes
For the very first time
When we find out why
We're here on Earth
(Here on Earth, here on Earth, here on Earth)


I was a book full of questions
Heart full of doubt
I sent 'em up to Heaven
Answers never came down
'Til they did one night
Maybe lovin' you's why
I'm here on Earth
Here on Earth

It's like we open our eyes
For the very first time
When we find out why
We're here on Earth
Here on Earth
It's like you opened my eyes
For the very first time
Yeah, lovin' you's why
I'm here on Earth
Here on Earth
Hey, hey, hey

Here on Earth
Yeah, lovin' you's why
I'm here on Earth
Here on Earth
Hey

[Song 38: Gravity]
4 ContributorsGravity Lyrics
Look what you have overcome to get here
Look at the distance you've run
The doubts that you’ve pushed down
Fear that you've drowned out
When they said that it couldn't be done

In your head, in your heart, in your hands
In your head, In your heart, in your hands
In your head, in your heart, in your hands
Gravity is a fragile thing

All of the words that you left in your throat
All of the dreams unlocked
Now you can finally see them
They meet you at your destination
Now that you have made it so far

In your head, in your heart, in your hands
In your head, in your heart, in your hands
In your head, in your heart, in your hands
Gravity is a fragile thing

It don’t define you
Gravity will lie to you, lie to you

Tell them to never let go
There is a beautiful valley below
When you hold on so tightly to the dream
Gravity is just a fragile thing

[Song 39: My Next Thirty Years]
6 ContributorsMy Next Thirty Years Lyrics
Woo

I think I'll take a moment, celebrate my age
The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now it's time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

Hey, my next thirty years, I'm gonna have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I've done
Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears
And I'll do it better in my next thirty years

My next thirty years, I'm gonna settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I'm doing here
In my next thirty years

Here we go
Alright

Oh, my next thirty years, I'm gonna watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Huh, maybe I'll remember my next thirty years

My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here
In my next thirty years

In my next thirty years
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright
Oh, here we go, boys

I don't want to be talking on the phone every night
Six PM, which timezone, yours or mine?
Ain't gonna worry where you are, who you're with
Let's just agree, this is it

Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, that I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
And I don't want to know, I don't want to know

See I'm just saving us some trouble somewhere down the line
This kind of town you just leave behind
And you don't know it yet, but you won't come back
And I ain't going nowhere and you know that

Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, that I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is

And you can go ahead and hate me, that's just fine
It doesn't matter either way, I'm right

Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, that I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is

I don't want to know

I don't know where that is

4 ContributorsOne Bad Habit Lyrics
She don't drink whiskey much but I do
She don't sit on old bar stools but I do
I don't worry about where she's been
I'm the only trouble she gets in
She don't have tattoos on her skin, but I do

'Cause I'm her wild side
The one crazy thing she does
I hope she never quits me
I hope she never gives me up
Well, I'm a mile away from perfect
If there's a curse word, man, I've cursed it
I'm the only hell shе's ever gonna raise
Thе one bad habit I hope she never breaks

She could put me down like a cigarette if she wanted to
Go and find somebody else if she wanted to
Thank God, I'm her one addiction
She ain't got around to kickin'
Hell, I couldn't blame her if she wanted to

I'm her wild side
The one crazy thing she does
I hope she never quits me
I hope she never gives me up
I'm a mile away from perfect
If there's a curse word, man, I've cursed it
I'm the only hell she's ever gonna raise
The one bad habit I hope she never breaks
I hope she never breaks

Oh, I'm her wild side
The one crazy thing she does
I hope she never quits me
I hope she never gives me up
She knows I'm miles away from perfect
If there's a curse word, man, I've cursed it
I'm the only hell she's ever gonna raise
The one bad habit
Her one bad habit, man, I hope she never breaks
I hope she never breaks

She don't drink whiskey much but I do

[Song 42: Down on the Farm]
6 ContributorsDown on the Farm Lyrics
Every Friday night, there's a steady cloud of dust
That leads back to a field filled with pickup trucks
Got old Hank crankin' way up loud
Got coolers in the back, tailgates down
There's a big fire burnin', but don't be alarmed
It's just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

Ed's been on the tractor, ain't seen Becky all week
Somebody said they seen 'em headed down to the creek
Farmer Johnson's daughters just pulled up in a jeep
Man, he knows how to grow 'em, if you know what I mean
Old Dave's gettin' loud, but he don't mean no harm
We're just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can't do inside those city limits
Ain't no closin' time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

Well, you can come as you are, there ain't no dress code
Just some rural route rules that you need to know
Don't mess with the bull, he can get real mean
Don't forget to shut the gate, stay out of the beans
If it starts to rainin', we'll just head to the barn
We're country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can't do inside those city limits
Ain't no closin' time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm
Ain't no closin' time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

Oh, let's get down, y'all
Stay out of that hay

[Song 43: Telluride]
4 ContributorsTelluride Lyrics
When I was nineteen I threw my stuff in the car
I headed up to the Rockies, got a job at this bar
Selling beer to the locals, just barely getting by
On the tips from the rich kids, there on daddy's dime
But when I saw her walk in one night
I knew that I would be all right in

Telluride, the snow falling down
I was waking up in that sleepy little town
In her eyes my world came so alive
I never will forget the moment she arrived
In Telluride

We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire
Casting shadows on the cabin wall, drowning in desire
Confessing all our secrets and laughing out loud
So high up on that mountain, I thought we'd never come down
It was a dream we were living in
And I was the happiest I had ever been in

Telluride, the snow falling down
Waking up with her in that sleepy little town
In her eyes my world came so alive
I never will forget all those sleepless nights
In Telluride
Telluride, whoa-oh-oh

It ended just like a movie scene
And I had to play the part
Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave
And me with the frozen heart

In Telluride, the snow falling down
Standing there alone in that sleepy little town
In her eyes, my world came so alive
I never will forget the day she said goodbye
In Telluride, the snow falling down
Waking up with her in that sleepy little town
In her eyes my world came so alive
I never will forget all those sleepless nights
In Telluride

[Song 44: Kill Myself]
6 ContributorsKill Myself Lyrics
I'm going to clean the house
I'm going to fix the fence
In my final hours
I'm going to tie up these loose ends
I won’t leave a note
For anyone to find
Tomorrow they'll know
What I've done here tonight

The drastic steps I'm taking
Are just an act of desperation
I knew no one would miss me
So what the hell
I fought and lied I drank too much
Hurt everyone I ever touched
Just how much I hurt you is hard to tell
This is not some kind of cry for help
Just good bye I wish you well
Because I love you
I'm going to kill myself

Now who is that
In my easy chair
Now wait a minute
That's the old me sitting there
And I thank God
The devil in me died
I stand before you now
A man changed and alive

The drastic steps I'm taking
Are just an act of desperation
I knew no one would miss me
So what the hell
I fought and lied I drank too much
Hurt everyone I ever touched
Just how much I hurt you is hard to tell
This is not some kind of cry for help
Just good bye I wish you well
Because I love you
I have to kill myself

Going to clean the house
Going to fix that fence
In my final hours I'm going to tie up these loose ends

[Song 45: One of These Days]
5 ContributorsOne of These Days Lyrics
We used to chase that boy home from school
We called him freckled-face red-headed fool
He was different, he wasn't cool like me
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones
But we never left well enough alone
Then one day he ran away from home you see

And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say

One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're gonna love me

Patty Sue was a small town beauty
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me
Lord knows she should have seen right through me
When I promised her the world
But at 17 you only want one thing
I left her standin' with my high school ring
Innocent tears in a pourin' rain
As I walked away

And I still see her in my dreams
And to this day she's whispering

One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the time you turned from me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're going to love me

Now everybody stands up
The congregation sings
It's a song of sweet forgiveness
And as the chorus rings
The wind blows clear my memory
The pages start to turn
Then suddenly I'm singing
The moment that I learn

One of these days I'm gonna love me
And feel the joy of sweet release
One of these days I'll rise above me
And at last I'll find some peace
And then I'm gonna smile a little
And maybe even laugh a little
But, one of these days
I'm gonna love me

She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling down all night

She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, "Baby why are you trembling like you are?"

So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snow
She's all things to behold

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's my kind of rain
Rain (Oh) on me (Rain on me)
She's my kind of rain

Dancin' when the evening fell
Dancin' in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown

Dancin' through the underground
Dancin' with the marionette
Are you happy now?

Where do you go when you're lonely?
Where do you go when you're blue?
Where do you go when you're lonely?
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue

Laughin' with your pretty mouth
Laughin' with your broken eyes
Laughin' with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby

Where do you go when you're lonely?
Where do you go when you're blue?
Where do you go when you're lonely?
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue

Girl, you've never known no one like me
Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl, they need to understand
Just who I am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby, I'm a real good man

I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby, I'm a real good man

I might have a reckless streak
At least a country-mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to lovin' you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man
(Here we go)

I take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
'Cept to do the best I can
I'll be damned

But baby, I'm a real good man

I may be a real bad boy
Oh, but baby, I'm a real good man

Can’t imagine what else could go wrong
Sometimes I’d like to hide away somewhere and lock the door
A single battle lost but not the war

'Cause tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

It’s almost like the hard times circle ‘round
A couple drops and they all start coming down
Yeah, I might feel defeated
I might hang my head
I might be barely breathing
But I’m not dead

'Cause tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

No, I’m not gonna let it get me down
I’m not gonna cry
And I’m not gonna lose any sleep tonight

'Cause tomorrow's another day
And I am not afraid
So bring on the rain

Tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

Ooh
Bring on, bring on the rain
No, I'm not gonna let it get me down
I'm not gonna cry

My old friend, I recall
The times we had hanging on my wall
I would not trade them for gold
Because they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
They are woven in the stories I have told
And tell again

My old friend, I apologize
For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
But the running and the races
The people and the places
There is always somewhere else I had to be
Time gets slim, my old friend

Do not know why, do not know why
Do not know why, do not know why

My old friend, this song is for you
Because a few simple verses
Was the least that I could do
To tell the world that you were here
Because the love and the laughter
Will live on long after
All of the sadness and the tears
We will meet again, my old friend

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My old friend, my old friend
Goodbye, goodbye

I can send a bridge up in smoke
And I can't count the people I've let down
The hearts I've broke
You ain't gotta dig too deep
If you wanna find some dirt on me
I'm learning who you've been
Ain't who you've got to be
It's gonna be an uphill climb
Aw, honey, I won't lie

I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

I’ve pinned a lot of demons to the ground
I’ve got a few old habits left
But there’s still one or two I might need you to help me get
Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust
But put some faith in me
And someday you’ll see
There’s a diamond under all this dust

I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little

'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Hey!

I'm down to my last dollar I've walk right though my shoes
Just a small reminder of the hell that I've gone through
But look at me still smiling as I'm wondering what I'll do
Since I ain’t got nothing I've got nothing to lose
Everybody say "hahaha, hahaha"
My friends are always giving me watches, hats, and wine
That's how I know this is serious that's how I know it's time
I don't have to worry about things that I don't have
'Cause if I ain't got nothing I've got nothing to hold me back

1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you’ve given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away

There's nothing that's worth keeping me
From places I should go
From happy Ville to loving land
I'm going to tour from coast to coast
I'm leaving everything behind
There's not much that I need
'Cause If I ain't got nothing
I'm footloose and fancy free

1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you’ve given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away

Look at me so free
Nothings holding me down (down)
Look at me so free
Can't keep my feet on the ground

'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and

I got a southern voice
A southern voice

[Song 55: What You’re Lookin’ For]
7 ContributorsWhat You’re Lookin’ For Lyrics
Baby, go on and do what you gotta do
I’ll never be the man that you want me too
Just keep me somewhere in your young, wild memory
And whenever you finally get to
Wherever your heart leads

I hope you find someone to love
And every dream that you dream of
I’m not the one you need and you know it
You’re gonna leave, so baby, get going
I won’t try to stop you anymore
Yeah, somewhere on the other side of that front door
I hope you find what you’re looking for

This has been coming down for a long, long time
I ain’t gonna change and I can’t change your mind
Just look back on me like a sun-soaked yesterday
And wherever your life leads you
Somewhere along the way

I hope you find someone to love
And every dream that you dream of
I’m not the one you need and you know it
You’re gonna leave, so baby, get going
I won’t try to stop you anymore
Yeah, somewhere on the other side of that front door
I hope you find what you’re looking for

I don’t wanna slow you down
Don’t wanna hold you down
You’re better off without me
I just wanna see you smile
Girl, I miss your smile
Wanna see you happy

I hope you find someone to love
And every dream that you dream of
I’m not the one you need and you know it
You’re gonna leave, so baby, get going
I won’t try to stop you anymore
Yeah, somewhere on the other side of that front door
I hope you find what you’re looking for

Baby, go on and do what you gotta do
I’ll never be the man that you want me too

[Song 56: Humble and Kind (Spanish/English Mix)]
1 ContributorHumble and Kind (Spanish/English Mix) Lyrics
You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine, always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Unas flores y un "te quiero"
No herir, mentir, robar
Aun tienes muchas rutas que andar y mas
Nunca te olvides de amar
Cuando aquel imposible sea tuyo
Cuando el cielo tu puedas alcanzar
Brilla y deja brillar y mas
Nunca te olvides de amar

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flying
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference with sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love
"I love you" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind

Unas flores y un "te quiero"
No herir, mentir, robar
Aun tienes muchas rutas que andar y mas
Nunca te olvides de amar
Cuando aquel imposible sea tuyo
Cuando el cielo tu puedas alcanzar
Brilla y deja brillar y mas
Nunca te olvides de amar

Cuando el sol ilumina tu patio
Es hora de salir y en el calor bailar
Que te escuchen cantar
Nunca te olvides de amar
Lleva contigo la luz del camino
Cuando mas brilla tu nombre piensa solo en los demas
Siempre hay algo que dar
Nunca te olvides de amar

[Song 57: Not a Moment Too Soon]
8 ContributorsNot a Moment Too Soon Lyrics
I was standing at the end of my rainbow with nowhere to go and no pot of gold in sight
All my wishes were just way too much to hope for, but when I saw you, I knew I'd seen the light

And not a moment too soon without a minute to spare
You touched my heart when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour with my world filled with gloom
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon

I used to think that love would never find me and the one who cares was lost somewhere in time
But when you found me, I knew I'd found forever, you rescued me just before I crossed the line

And not a moment too soon without a minute to spare
You touched my heart when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour with my world filled with gloom
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Not a moment too soon

[Song 58: Can’t Tell Me Nothin’]
5 ContributorsCan’t Tell Me Nothin’ Lyrics
1986 Harley
Blowing smoke and sucking oil
My daddy said, 'Buy it and you are crazy boy'
You cannot tell me nothing
It took two months to fix it up
And one day to lay her down
I got a little hitch in my get-along now
You cannot tell me nothing

Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
You cannot tell me nothing

Hometown homecoming sweetheart
Nobody thought I had a prayer
Her mama said, Boy, do not you come around here
Cannot tell me nothing
They say be careful what you wish for
I want to be her man
Two babies and a trailer later here I am
Cannot tell me nothing

Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
You cannot tell me nothing

They say drinking will kill you
The same thing for rolling smokes
But that is two of the three things that I like most
Cannot tell me nothing
I know what the good book preaches
But I know how I am
I just hope somebody up there understands
Cannot tell me nothing

[Song 59: Grown Men Don’t Cry]
6 ContributorsGrown Men Don’t Cry Lyrics
I pulled into the shopping centre
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions running down her face
All morning I would been thinking my life is so hard
And they wore everything they own, living in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away

But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

Keep having this dream about my old man
I am 10 years old, and he is holding my hand
We are talking on the front porch watching the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he could not be around
So many things I want to say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry

I am sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it is up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
"I haven't had my story yet"
And everything weighing on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says
"I love you dad"

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry

[Song 60: How Bad Do You Want It]
5 ContributorsHow Bad Do You Want It Lyrics
Robert Johnson went to the crossroads, so the legend goes
He left with his guitar and the devil took his soul, the devil took his soul

Been out here on this highway
Breathing diesel smoke
Driving hard for hours
Trying to make that Memphis show
People always ask me
"Son what does it take
To reach out and touch your dreams?"
To them I always say

Are you hungry
Are you thirsty
Is it a fire that burns you up inside
How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Are you eating, sleeping, dreaming
With that one thing on your mind
How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Cause if you want it all
You've got to lay it all out on the line

I get to make my living
Doing what I love
Every night I give my heart and soul
Sometimes that ain't enough
But brother, if you're like me
Looking down that road
Be careful of that wild wind, son
Sometimes it don't let go

Can you feel it
Can you taste it
Can you hear it knocking at your door
How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Are you eating, sleeping, dreaming
With that one thing on your mind
How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Cause if you want it all
You've got to lay it all out on the line

There is always a price you pay no matter what you do
If you're gonna climb that mountain to the top
It always comes down to

How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Are you eating, sleeping, dreaming
With that one thing on your mind
How bad do you want it
How bad do you need it
Cause if you want it all
You've got to lay it all out on the line

Robert Johnson went to the crossroads, so the legend goes
He left with his guitar and the devil took his soul, the devil took his soul

[Song 61: Shotgun Rider (2007)]
9 ContributorsShotgun Rider (2007) Lyrics
Horses are running wide open I just got to ride
To those honky-tonk bars that stay open way past closing time
Songs 'bout free thinking and drinking sure light my fire
That flame leaves a scar on my heart like an old branding iron

She said rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Yesterday's nothing but dust I brush off my boots
While I'm wearing out roads don't you know that I'm sure missing you
If I leave you'll be wondering when I'll be back again
Between Texas and ranchers and old friends where do you fit in

She said rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Come on

Hey rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

Woman come lay down beside me and be my shotgun rider

[Song 62: People Like Us]
3 ContributorsPeople Like Us Lyrics
Mike's a pipeline welder, Kim's a drive-thru teller
Johnny's a drug dealer, Bob's a concrete sealer
Terry is a soldier, Tom's a church league bowler
We are liars and lawyers, lovers, sisters, brothers

People like us watch the blues on TV
Get so angry, blame it on DC
People like us, all God's children
If we're willing, we can be building a tomorrow we can trust
But it's up to people like us

We wear Jordans, we wear flip-flops
We wear wingtips and Luccheses with tube socks
And we wear high heels and we wear work boots
But we won't ever know each other 'til we walk a mile in each other's shoes

People like us watch the blues on TV
Get so angry, blame it on DC
People like us, all God's children
If we're willing, we can be building a tomorrow we can trust
But it's up to people like us

We can point the finger, there's enough blame to go around
I wonder what would happen if we turned that finger around?

Yeah, people like us, we're a preacher with a dream
Put a man on the moon, we can do anything
Yeah, people like us, we're all God's children
If we're willing, we can be building a tomorrow we can trust
But it's up to people like us

I believe in people like us

[Song 63: Damn Sure Do]
4 ContributorsDamn Sure Do Lyrics
Girl, I know it seems like I'm hell or bust
I know a few words that'll make you blush
That line I walk's been crazy as a corkscrew
And I've got some miles on these cowboy boots

I've been up in smoke and down in ditches
Swung and missed some easy pitches
Been plumb whiskey blind a time or two
I missed planes I supposed to be on
Held up by the Kings of Neon
Dancing in that midnight shade of blue
So I thank my lucky stars
With my hand here on my heart
Do I want you? Gotta have you, near you
Well, I damn sure do

You're the love line running through the palm of my hand
The kiss that kills me right where I stand
You're my stay in bed, rainy day, radio on
And you're the reason why they write them songs

I've been up in smoke and down in ditches
Swung and missed some easy pitches
Been plumb whiskey blind a time or two
I missed planes I supposed to be on
Held up by the Kings of Neon
Dancing in that midnight shade of blue
So I thank my lucky stars
With my hand here on my heart
Do I want you? Gotta have you, near you
Well, I damn sure do

Yeah, I missed planes I supposed to be on
Held up by the Kings of Leon
Dancing in that midnight shade of blue
So when the preacher said, "Do you take this girl?"
Right in front of the whole wide world
I said, "I damn sure do"
I said, "I damn sure do"
"Yeah, I damn sure do"

[Song 64: California]
11 ContributorsCalifornia Lyrics
It’s a three-day drive if she drives all night
Says she’s leavin’ at the crack of dawn
Well, she might still be lyin’ here with me
But in her heart she’s already gone
Already packed up, the Altima’s gassed up
She done put the map up there on the dash
And I’m all tore up just tryin’ to man up
Dammin’ these tears up, but can’t hold ‘em back

‘Cause she’s in love with California
And that west coast sunshine dream
These ain’t no Hollywoods
And these hills ain’t Beverly
Ain’t no beaches on these backroads
No sunset on the boulevard
She’s in love with California
And breakin’ my heart

Got a waitress job, waitin’ in an IHOP
Throw a rock and hit Universal City
Got a glamour shot in her hip pocket
Hopin’ somebody’ll think she’s pretty
By this time tomorrow she’ll hit Colorado
I’ll be drownin’ my sorrow in a bottle of Beam
Before she hits Fagstaff maybe she’ll backtrack
But I wouldn’t bet that if i was me

‘Cause she’s in love with California
And that west coast sunshine dream
These ain’t no Hollywoods
And these hills ain’t Beverly
Ain’t no beaches on these backroads
No sunset on the boulevard
She’s in love with California
And breakin’ my heart

She was all mine
But now it’s go time

And she’s in love with California
And that west coast sunshine dream
These ain’t no Hollywoods
And these hills ain’t Beverly
There ain’t no beaches on these backroads
No sunset on the boulevard
She’s in love with California
And breakin’ my heart

She’s in love with California
And breakin’ my heart
Oh, she’s breakin’ my heart

How did a boy from nowhere catch them ocean view eyes, so blue?
Damn girl, lay 'em on me again
Way outta my league, sometimes I laugh
Wearing that champagne dress, girl
It's hard not to brag, well, I don't mind
Spin around for me one more time

I might like cheap beer and real bad jokes
Trucks that don't start and quick stop smokes
But I got good taste in women
Yeah, I sleep like a baby in a Motel 6
I like dive bar bands that can't sing a lick
But I got good taste in women
Looking at you just looking at me
Got everybody thinking I'm high class living
I got good taste in women, yeah

Oh, baby, I love what that says about you
Maybe rough around the edges is just what you're into
Damn, girl, that brings a smile to face
'Cause at the end of the day

Take a little high life and Dom Pérignon
Pour 'em both together, make something strong
And it's you and me, girl
A little pawn shop rock and a string of pearls
You be Marilyn, baby, I'll be Merl'
That's you and me, girl
That's you and me, girl

You look at me with those eyes and I'm your fool
And it's only just a matter of time until we're cool
Sayin' something I laugh at

You're hard to stay mad at
And I've tried a million times but baby, I know
You reach for me and I just let it go
Just like that

If you weren't so damn stubborn, we would've never got this far
Be just another casualty, two people in a bar
Here we are, another day
Everytime I walk away, I walk right back

'Cause you're hard to stay mad at
And they say you should never go to bed that way
And I can't sleep if you're not happy anyway
Just something I'm bad at

If you weren't so damn stubborn, we would've never got this far
Be just another casualty, two people in a bar
Here we are, another day
Everytime I walk away, I walk right back
'Cause you're hard to stay mad at

Hard to stay mad at
God knows sometimes we fight, sometimes we cuss
And I swear we'd do it for the making up
We're damn good at that
You're hard to stay mad at

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, you're hard to stay mad at
And I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you

I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you

8 ContributorsFelt Good On My Lips Lyrics
Said her name was a hand me down name
From the side of a family that long ago came
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips

She tipped the DJ to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was a rocking on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said, "Let's go and get it on"
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it
I don’t know what it meant but it felt good on my lips

Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you

Everybody saying whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips

She ordered us a drink, it was a purple kind of pink
She said it’s got a shot of a little bit of everything
Mellow yellow umbrella for a fella like me
It was just a bit mellow for me to be seen with
But I took a sip, yeah it felt good on my lips

Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you

Everybody saying whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips

When the lights came on and they hollered last call
I was busy getting lost in her cherry lip gloss
In a little corner booth, eye to eye no talk
She leaned in close and gave me one long
And wet Goodnight goodbye kiss and It felt good on my lips


Whoa, how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips
Whoa, how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips

Baby, I think we both know
It's gone wrong, wrong, wrong
And I know you don't think we can carry it on
Baby, I think we both know
It's gone bad, bad, bad
Think of all the good times we had
Driving to your house
'Member when we first met
Dancing on a friday night
Under the moonlight
Talking 'til the night was gone
In the back of my truck with the radio on

Then that old song comes on
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing
When that old song comes on
Together we're singing
Forever we're singing
That old country song
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, I think we both know
It's alright, alright
But how could I forget what you did that night
Baby, you told me you loved me in Tennessee
Where we were gonna live
But now you've done a few things that I can't forgive
Driving to her house
Tellin' her you love her
Lying on a friday night
Ring in your pocket
Lying to me all along
In the back of your truck with the radio on

Then that old song comes on

Creek goes rippling by
I've been barefootin' all day with my baby
Brown leaves have started falling
Leading the way

I like it best just like this
Doing nothing all the way
So let's lay down in the tall grass
Dreaming away

And all I wanna do is let it be and be with you
And watch the wind blow by
And all I wanna see is you and me go on forever
Like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only
You and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by

Girl, you know you told me not so long ago (Not so long ago)
To let it come, then let it pass
And all your troubles and your sorrows
They won't last

So let me kiss you now, little darling
Beneath this autumn moon
Cold winds, another season
Will be here soon

And all I wanna do is let it be and be with you
And watch the wind blow by
And all I wanna see is you and me go on forever
Like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only
You and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by, yeah
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by

12 ContributorsDamn Country Music LyricsThis is a song about following your dream.  In this case it’s the dream of country music stardom and the singer is leaving everything he knows and loves behind to chase it.
McGraw told Taste of Country:
“I… Read More 
I packed it all on a whim
Threw an old Hank cassette tape in
Dad's '84 rusty Ford
He swore we'd never make it
I quit my job, let my mama down
Broke an angel's heart on the way out of town
Pulled my roots from the ground for

The hum of wheels on the blacktop
The strum of strings on the flattop
It's a neon fever for a small town dreamer
Tells you everything you have is worth losing
Damn country music

You might get lost in the lights
The things that keep you up all night
Whiskey straight, 3 a.m.
Chasing songs in your head
It's the sweetest highs, the lowest lows
It's needing "yes" and hearing "no"
Just another sold soul
Believe me, I know it's

The hum of wheels on the blacktop
The strum of strings on the flattop
It'll take you, break you
Damn sure make you do things
You never thought you'd be doing
Damn country music

When the money, the fame
The lights on your name all fade away
Well, you'll still be a slave to

The hum of wheels on the blacktop
The strum of strings on the flattop
It's a neon fever for a small town dreamer
Tells you everything you have is worth losing
Damn country music
Damn country music

8 ContributorsCan’t Be Really Gone Lyrics
Her hat is hanging by the door
The one she bought in Mexico
It blocked the wind, it stopped the rain
She'd never leave that one
So she can't be really gone

The shoes she bought on Christmas Eve
She laughed and said they called her name
It's like they're waiting in the hall
For her to slip them on
So she can't be really gone

I don't know when she'll come back
She must intend to come back
And I've seen the error of my ways
Don't waste the tears on me
What more proof do you need?
Just look around the room
So much of her remains

Her book is lying on the bed
The two of hearts to mark her page
Now who could ever walk away
At chapter 21?
So, she can't be really gone

Just look around this room
So much of her remains

Her book is lying on the bed
The two of hearts to mark her page
Now who could ever walk away
With so much left undone?
So, she can't be really gone
No, she can't be really gone

Lookin' like the perfect night for a liftoff
Got some swisher sweets sittin' in the glovebox
Baby, I could be your rocket man
What ya say we get lost someplace and
Write our names in the constellations?
Got some triple beam lights and a cooler of floatin' cans

And I know you're at home, starin' out your window
Feeling stuck down
But tonight we gon' take this thing off the ground
I'll pick you up and I'll

Drop it into fifth gear, we'll fly
Light up this little hometown sky
Do what we wanna do all night
Roll it up, light it up, get a little high
I got the good stuff sittin' right here
We can catch a little buzz lightyear
Take some weight off and float our feet up
Go somewhere nobody can reach us, no
Lookin' at Earth and watchin' it spin
I got this Chevy spaceship with your name on it, hop in

Girl, you got me fired up like a rocket
All I'm sayin' is climb up in the cockpit
Bet ya never been up close to a shootin' star
We ain't gotta talk about this town, no
'Cause way up high, we can keep it on the down-low
Get a little freefall goin' in your heart

The stars in the air
It's like we can touch 'em
Let me come by and pick you up
We can do some intergalactic lovin'

Drop it into fifth gear, we'll fly
Light up this little hometown sky
Do what we wanna do all night
Roll it up, light it up, get a little high
I got the good stuff sittin' right here
We can catch a little buzz lightyear
And take some weight off and float our feet up
Go somewhere nobody can reach us, no
Lookin' at Earth and watchin' it spin
I got this Chevy spaceship with your name on it, hop in

Drop it into fifth gear, we'll fly
Light up this little hometown sky
Do what we wanna do all night
Roll it up, light it up, get a little high
I got the good stuff sittin' right here
We can catch a little buzz lightyear
And take some weight off and float our feet up
Go somewhere nobody can reach us, no
Lookin' at Earth and watchin' it spin
I got this Chevy spaceship with your name on it, hop in

[Song 74: Remember Me Well]
3 ContributorsRemember Me Well Lyrics
I don't really know how we got here
You wanna be somewhere, but it’s not here
Tryna find a new corner of the blue clear sky
Where you can disappear to
You can drive fifty-five by the windmills
See how a little different sun on your skin feels
I don't know what you see through your windshield
But when you look in your rearview

If you're gonna drink to me, drink tequila
If you’re gonna think of me, think of that balcony
On the corner of 5th and Eviston
Like we're back in that beach motel again
It wasn't just wasted time wе spent together
Wе had a few moments worth forever
If you're gonna love me, don't keep it to yourself
If you're gonna hate me, tell me go to hell
If you're gonna forget me, find someone else
If you're gonna remember me, remember me well

I guess the heart only wants what the heart wants
Even the best dreams run out of stardust
Fire’s gone, but man, we had a spark once
I hold onto that and I hope you do too
Don’t know what else to do
If it's over, it’s over
But when you look over your shoulder

If you're gonna drink to me, drink tequila
If you're gonna think of me, think of that balcony
On the corner of 5th and Eviston
Like we're back in that beach motel again
It wasn’t just wasted time we spent together
We had a few moments worth forever
If you're gonna love me, don't keep it to yourself
If you're gonna hate me, tell me go to hell
If you're gonna forget me, find someone else
If you're gonna remember me, remember me well

Somewhere down the road

If you're gonna drink to me, drink tequila
If you're gonna think of me, think of that balcony
On the corner of 5th and Eviston
Like we're back in that beach motel again
It wasn't just wasted time we spent together
We had a few moments worth forever
If you're gonna love me, don't keep it to yourself
If you're gonna hate me, tell me go to hell
If you're gonna forget me, find someone else
If you're gonna remember me, remember me well

Remember me well
I hope you remember me well
Oh, oh
I hope you remember me well

(Oh, oh)

[Song 75: She Never Lets It Go to Her Heart]
9 ContributorsShe Never Lets It Go to Her Heart Lyrics
Everywhere I go, they're staring at her
Every man I know, he wants to have her
I guess I ought to be a jealous man
I look the other way, they're hitting on her
Every night and day, they telephone her
They try and get to her but I know they can't

'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking, she starts walking right back to my arms
She can turn every head but she never lets it go to her heart

She walks into the room and everybody
Watches every move, hoping she don't love me
I know it by the way they hang around
But they don't realize there's more to her
Than what meets the eye, that's why I am certain
No matter what they do to reach her now

She never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking, she starts walking right back to my arms
She can turn every head but she never lets it go to her heart

'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking, she starts walking right back to my arms
She can turn every head but she never lets it go to her heart

5 ContributorsSome Things Never Change Lyrics
After all this time, I still miss you every day
The same world spins 'round, I guess some things never change
Sometimes I go out but it never feels the same
I still look for you, baby, some things never change

When I said I'd love you for eternity
I just never knew how true those words would be
Just an old love song, just a mention of your name
My heart breaks in two again, I guess some things never change

Maybe someday, someone else will set me free
Until then I'll live with your love's legacy
And I'll keep holding on, hoping you'll come back someday
You can rest assured, baby, some things never change
Girl, I'm still in love with you, I guess some things never change

I still love you
I guess some things never change

Say exactly how you feel
Right now you're free to say it all
There is no one here to judge you
I only love you
You're free to close your eyes and fall
You can trust me, this is real
Say exactly how you feel

Tell me all your dreams
And what you think love means
We'll lock the world outside
Embrace the gift of time
Promising forever
Knowing that this moment
Might be all we ever find

Every breath of who you are
Tells a story that I love
I have finally found the truth
In what I see in you
And what I feel with every touch
The simple beauty of your heart
In every breath of who you are

Tell me all your dreams
And what you think love means
We'll lock the world outside
Embrace the gift of time
Promising forever
Knowing that this moment
Might be all we ever find


Tell me all your dreams
And what you think love means
We'll lock the world outside
Embrace the gift of time
Promising forever
Knowing that this moment
Might be all we ever find

Promising forever
Knowing that this moment
Might be all we ever find

[Song 78: Refried Dreams]
5 ContributorsRefried Dreams Lyrics
Last Monday mornin', you left with no warnin', I started goin' insane
Well, I headed south out of Del Rio, Texas with a hell of a load on my brain
And I kept on goin' without even knowin' how much your love really means
Now I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams

I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams

This picture ain't pretty, I'm ragged and dirty and wonderin' what I'm doin' here
Shootin' tequila, wantin' to kill you and wishin' to God you were near
So full of your memory, but feelin' so empty, I've run out of my self-esteem
Now I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams

I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams
I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is poundin' in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and comin' apart at the seams
I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams
Oh, I'm messed up in Mexico, livin' on refried dreams

Got ramblin' in my boots
There's a lot of strings that I've cut loose
I ain't afraid of takin' flight

[Song 80: For a Little While]
6 ContributorsFor a Little While Lyrics
Hot sun, dancin' on the river
We're sittin' on the bank, watch the world go by
Our feet in the water, she pressed her lips to mine
We were so long on love, but short on time

She could be a honeymoon sweet and a little wild
But she was mine, oh, for a little while

And I laugh every time I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while

We'd take a ride and head on down to Airport Road
Put the seats back and watch the planes leave town
She always said nobody's strong enough to tie her down
Oh, but I wasn't lookin' for that, anyhow

I knew she'd leave, but I didn't know when
It matters to me now, oh, but it didn't back then

And I laugh every time I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while

I keep seein' pictures now
Of me and her and those summer nights
My mind fills with her
Oh, but it's alright

'Cause I laugh every time I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine

Yeah she was mine
Oh, for a little while
Yeah

2 ContributorsI Just Love You Lyrics
Lonely, yeah that's the word
I leave my heart when I leave her
Days go on like molasses and the nights do too
One evening out on the road, half a world away from home
I thought she was sleeping when the call came through
I said darling it's late, is everything okay
And the silence took over the road
'Til she said

I, I just love you
Don't know why I just do
When are you coming home
Babe I'm coming home soon
And I just love you too

Lonely lets me be for a while she sets me free
I close my eyes and I dream of her
She wrapped in my arm, her head on my heart
And softly she whispers the words

I, I just love you
Don't know way I just do
When are you coming home?
Babe I'm coming home soon
And I just love you too

Ooh I'll never stop being amazed
That my four year old girl knows exactly what to say
Yeah

I, I just love you
Don't know way I just do
When are you coming home?
Babe I'm coming home soon
And I just love you too
And I just love you too

5 ContributorsWhiskey And You Lyrics
There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
I'll be hurting when I wake up on the floor
And I'll be over it by noon
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you

Come tomorrow I can walk in any store
It aren’t a problem yeah they'll always sell me more
But you're forgiveness is something I can't buy
Aren’t a thing that I can do
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you

One's the devil and one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they aren’t both the same
One's a liar that helps hide me from my pain
And one's a long hard bitter truth
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you

I've got a problem but it aren’t like what you think
I drink 'cause I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
If I don't break down and bring it on myself it'll hit right out of the blue
That's the difference between the whiskey and you

One's the devil and one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they aren’t both the same
One's a liar that helps hide me from my pain
And one's a long hard bitter truth
And that's the difference between the whiskey and you

Yeah that's the difference between the whiskey and you

[Song 83: Still]
7 ContributorsStill Lyrics
There's a place I like to go
Where I can hear the cotton grow
Midnight train whistles blow
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do is just be still

There's the place I love to be
Momma, daddy, my sister and me
First time I ever saw the beach
Back to 1983
All I really have to do is just be still
Sister & me
First time I ever saw the beach back to 1983
All I really have to do is just be still
When this world gets crazy
And tries to break me
And I had all I can stand
I can close my eyes no matter where I am
And just be still

There's a place that I can see
Where my baby's next to me
Close enough to feel the heat
All wound up beneath the sheets
All I have to do is just be still

When this world gets crazy
And tries to break me
And I had all I can stand
I can close my eyes
No matter where I am
And just be still

There's a place I need to go
Where the stain-glass windows glow
Every part of me is known
Thank God I can go there
Thank God I can go there still
Still

Oh! Thank God I can go there still

I thought that was your voice
I thought that was my car
Now we ain't ever met before
But I know who you are
You're living in my house
And I'm living in a tent
And don't laugh, this second job of mine
Is paying both our rents
You're out here buying Happy Meals
And I'm eating rice and pintos
You so much as crack a smile at me, man
I'll come through this here window

Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you took that life
That I used to live
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the cat
Yeah I think that's just about everything
Oh I almost forgot
Do you want fries with that?

Your ketchup's in the bag
And a check is in the mail
I hope your chicken's raw inside
And I hope your bun is stale
I'm supposed to tell you
"Please come back"
But how about this instead?
I hope you both choke on a pickle
Man, that would tickle me to death
I don't know what you're waiting on
You're holding up the line
Oh man, you ain't got no change coming back
Are you out of your mind?

Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you took that life
That I used to live
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the cat
Yeah I reckon that's all there is
Do you want fries with that?

Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you stole the life
That I used to live
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the cat
Yeah I guess that about covers it
Do you want fries with that?

I've been caught sideways out here on the crossroads
Trying to buy back the pieces I lost of my soul
It's hard when the devil won't get off your back
It's like carrying around the past in a hundred pound sack

Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah

Skeletons and ghosts are hiding in the shadows
Threatening me with all the things that they know
Choices and mistakes, they all know my name
But I'm through holding in and holding onto all that pain

Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah

I know I know I know I've been forgiven
I know I know I know I'm going to start living

Today I'm going to keep on walking
I'm going to hold my head up high
I'm going to leave it all behind
Today I'm going to stand out in the rain
Let it wash it all away Yeah wash it all away
I'm going to let it go oh yeah
I'm going to let it go oh yeah

Just look at that Palomino running like the wind
And that pretty old paint is acting like she's young again
Sometimes I wonder where they'd go if they didn't have that fields

There's just something about horses
That can touch you deep down in your soul
Girl look at 'em go
Makes you wanna just throw off your cares and your troubles
And go somewhere no one's ever gone before
Well...

You and me can do that tonight and
Let the beat of our hearts go flying
Underneath that milky way ceiling
If you want to saddle up this feeling
Baby let's ride that wild wind blowing
Let it kiss you some stars out of the sky
Get carried away like some deep river rolling
Tonight, I wanna be your cowboy lullaby

Can't you hear that half-moon calling?
He's gonna hang out all night long
And sing us a song, yeah
All you gotta do is take my hand and
You and me can be weed field dancing
Now that we got a good fire burning
Let's hide away and let the world keep turning

Baby let's ride that wild wind blowing
Let it kiss you some stars out of the sky
Get carried away like some deep river rolling
Tonight, I wanna be your cowboy lullaby
Your cowboy lullaby

You and me can do that tonight and
Let the beat of our hearts go flying
Underneath that milky way ceiling
If you wanna saddle up this feeling
Baby let's ride that wild wind blowing
Let it kiss you some stars out of the sky
Get carried away like some deep river rolling

You're an old soul, a wild child
A badass with a sweet smile
Makes you feel good, makes you fall in love
Make you feel like you can't get enough

You're like the first time I heard Sheryl Crow on the radio
One song, had to have the whole record
Gonna be stuck in my head forever
I knew I'd never be the same again, you pulled me in
Like a sun soaked California winding road
Barefoot stripped-down rock and roll

I remember everything like it was yesterday
The way you looked at me and how the world went away
You were something new, but you felt like home
Every word sounded like I knew it all along

You're like the first time I heard Sheryl Crow on the radio
One song, had to have the whole record
Gonna be stuck in my head forever
I knew I'd never be the same again, you pulled me in
Like a sun soaked California winding road

Makes you feel good, makes you fall in love
Make you feel like you can't get enough

And don't really wanna know  where you're goin'
Maybe once or twice, you see, time after time
I tried to, to hold on to what we got, but now you're goin'

And I don't mind about the things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame, but I'm givin' you back your name, yeah, yeah
Yes, I'll be on my way, I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along, I'm lookin' for a good time

Sail on down the line, ain't it funny how the time can go on?
Friends say they told me so, but it doesn't matter
It was plain to see that a small town boy like me
Just wasn't your cup of tea
I was wishful thinkin'

I gave you my heart, and I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothin' in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say, "Would you please just go away," yeah, yeah
I've thrown away the blues, I'm tired of bein' used
I want everyone to know I'm lookin' for a good time, a good time

It'd be just another river town
Streets would have a different sound
There'd be no honky tonks with whiskey rounds
No dreamers chasing dreams down

No tourists taking in the sights
No stetsons under Broadway lights
No pickers playing for pocket change
No rhinestone boots on an old church stage

Hey blue eyes, cryin' in the rain
Hey fire, burnin' round the ring
Hey crazy, you know it's true
That Nashville, wouldn't be Nashville, without you

No ghost of the man in black
No long white Cadillac
No woman standing by her man
In the place where it all began

Hey good lookin', hey mama tried
Hey gambler, hey country boy can survive
Hey Jolene, you know it's true
That Nashville, wouldn't be Nashville, without you

Hey Georgia, hey smoky mountain rain
Hey Galveston, he stopped loving her today
Hey fancy, you know it's true
That Nashville, wouldn't have
Blue eyes, cryin' in the rain
Hey fire, burnin' round the ring
Hey crazy, you know it's true
That Nashville, wouldn't be Nashville, without you

If there's a Chevy, I bet you're shotgunnin'
If there's a mailman, I bet he's runnin'
If there's huntin' and fishin' in Heaven
I hope the good Lord lets you tag along
Doggone it, amen

Waitin' to catch that first yellow bus
Yeah, you knew I was scared
So you waited with me and when I got back
You were waitin' right there
'Cause that's what best friends do
Doggone, I miss you

My first kiss and you didn't like the girl
Guess you knew somethin' I didn't know
One heartbreak later, I guess you were right
You barked, "I told you so" (Ha)
Aw, colorblind but you could see the truth

At the pearly white picket fence
And I'll miss you 'ol buddy 'til then

She's getting dressed up, putting on that lipstick
Shimmy shakeing, right into them cutoffs baby, oh yeah
You're getting off work, cashing out that paycheck
Gotta change that shirt and pick that girl up on her front step
Here she comes now lookin' so fine
You've been waiting on this night for such a long, long time

She slides in and you roll down Main Street
You turn right when that red light turns green
Sun sets now, you're half way to heaven
She picks a song, you turn it up to 11
You say, "Do you wanna?" and she says, "Hell, yeah"
So you hit the party, all your buddies are jealous
Someday you'll be looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights

Crowded backyard, everybody's laughin'
Kinda party, next week you'll say I was there when it happened
Coming up on midnight, 'bout time to get gone
And then the DJ starts to play your favorite song
You slow dance for 3 minutes or so, and then she whispers, "Baby, let's go."

And when she slides in and she gives you the green light
You hold off 'till you turn on the headlights
Someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
Yeah, one of those nights

Full moon through a crack in the windshield
You hold her close and you'll never forget how her heartbeat feels
No, you never will
'Cause someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights

Yeah, one of those nights
One of those nights
Yeah, one of those nights
One of those nights, oh
One of those nights
This is gonna be, hey
This is gonna be
One of those nights
Oh, oh

[Song 93: Sleeping in the Stars]
4 ContributorsSleeping in the Stars Lyrics
When God calls me home
And my soul is laid to rest
That won't mean I'm gone
Darlin', heaven knows
I'll love you just the same
So don't you feel alone
You may cry a tear or two and that's okay
Just know I'll never be too far away

I'll be sleeping in the stars
Shining through the dark
Watching, smiling, singing out in the silence
Everywhere you are, I'll be sleeping in the stars

Some steps that we take
Leave an everlasting mark
Even death can't take away
So, if you're missing me
Just look inside your heart
And let the memories play

You may cry a tear or two and that's okay
Look up and know I'm not that far away

I'll be sleeping in the stars
Shining through the dark
Watching, smiling, singing out in the silence
Everywhere you are, I'll be sleeping in the stars
I'll be sleeping in the stars
Shining through the dark
Watching, smiling, singing out in the silence
Everywhere you are, I'll be sleeping in the stars
Everywhere you are, I'll be sleeping in the stars

[Song 94: Memory Lane]
4 ContributorsMemory Lane Lyrics
People ask me, "What you doin', son?" You're gonna drive yourself insane
You'll never find the sunshine when you're followin' the rain
Seems like I'd take a new road after all these years
But I wind up on the same old trail of tears

I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain, recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame down on Heartbreak Avenue
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you

I hate the way I loved you but my mind keeps goin' back
My train of thought just won't get off that same old worn out track
It's an ev'ry night occasion me and your memory meet
On that endless lonely street of broken dreams

I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain, recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame down on Heartbreak Avenue
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you


I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain, recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame down on Heartbreak Avenue
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you

Here she comes now
I'm still walkin' (walkin')
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin'
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin' (walkin')
Down Memory Lane
Lord, I'm walkin'
Down Memory Lane
Oh, I'm walkin' (walkin')
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin' (walkin', walkin')
Down Memory Lane
I'm walkin' (walkin')

5 ContributorsThe Bed We Made Lyrics
The dishes are clean in the kitchen
There ain't no dirt on the floor
The laundry's all done washing
There ain't no honey do list no more
The sugar bowl is off in the sugar
The car has been washed and waxed
The roses have all been watered
It's damn near perfect on the colder sad song

Let's go make a mess of
The bed we made this morning
Like the room's been hit by a hurricane
Throw those pillows on the hardwood
And tangle those sheets up real good
Let's go make a mess of
Make a mess of the bed we made

I'm talking candlewax on the dresser
Half spilled empty bottle of wine
A trail of clothes down the hallway
Pick it up tomorrow, but baby, tonight...

Let's go make a mess of
The bed we made this morning
Like the room's been hit by a hurricane
Throw those pillows on the hardwood
And tangle those sheets up real good
Let's go make a mess of
Make a mess of the bed we made

So you go and pull back the covers
I'll go and pull down the shades

Let's go make a mess of
The bed we made this morning
Like the room's been hit by a hurricane
Throw those pillows on the hardwood
And tangle those sheets up real good
Let's go make a mess of
Make a mess of the bed we made

Let's go make, let's go make, make a mess of the bed
Make a mess of the bed we made
Let's go make, let's go make, make a mess of the bed
Make a mess of the bed we made

[Song 96: Cuttin’ Onions]
4 ContributorsCuttin’ Onions Lyrics
Homemade curtains in the breeze
Green grass stains on both of my knees
My first memory
Was mama poppin' grease and fryin' chicken
Cryin', cuttin' onions in the kitchen
Sunday mornin', my best shirt
Crock-Pot's on for dinner after church
Dad was baptized by Lynchburg
Mama'd always beg him to come with us
Cryin', cuttin' onions in the kitchen

Jesus on a cross down the hallway in a picture
Devil's in the bottom of a bottle of brown liquor
Daddy's on the front porch pourin' one more high or more
Than Haggard's pickin'
And mama's cuttin' onions in the kitchen

17, summer buzz
I stumbled in, she waited up
Screen door creaked and there she was
Both our eyes werе red 'cause I'd been sippin'
She said shе'd been cuttin' onions in the kitchen

Jesus on a cross down the hallway in a picture
Devil's in the bottom of a bottle of brown liquor
Daddy's on the front porch pourin' one more high or more
Than Haggard's pickin'
And mama's cuttin' onions in the kitchen

Flowers have the dirt
Behind white picket fences
Mama tried on vinyl
Keeps on spinnin', spinnin', spinnin'

Jesus on a cross down the hallway in a picture
Devil's in the bottom of a bottle of brown liquor
Daddy's six feet in the ground, everybody's at the house
Nevermind all the colored dishes
Mama's cuttin' onions in the kitchen
Mm

[Song 97: Hey Whiskey]
6 ContributorsHey Whiskey Lyrics
All I ever did was give you my attention
Every Friday night since I turned twenty-two
I trusted you with my naive intentions
Hey, whiskey, what'd I ever do to you?
I gave you every penny in my pocket
You helped me lie and made me tell the truth
Stayed out with you all night when you came callin'
Hey, whiskey, what'd I ever do to you?

I let you stay, you made her leave
Made me say things I don't mean
To the only girl that ever made me choose
Gave you everything I had
Went to hell and can't get back
The only thing I couldn't stand to lose
Hey, whiskey
Hey, whiskey, what'd I ever do to you?

You talked me into letting her walk out
Promised me I'd find somebody new
But I gotta ask from where I sit right now
Hey, whiskey, what'd I ever do to you?

I let you stay, you made her leave
Made me say things I don't mean
To the only girl that ever made me choose
Gave you everything I had
Went to hell and can't get back
The only thing I couldn't stand to lose
Hey, whiskey
Hey, whiskey, what'd I ever do to you?

I held you up
You let me drown
No, you ain't worth the hurt
So why can't I put you down?

I let you stay, you made her leave
Made me say things I don't mean
To the only girl that ever made me choose
Gave you everything I had
Went to hell and can't get back
Both the hearts that you just broke in two
Hey, whiskey
Hey, whiskey, what'd I ever do to you?
Hey, whiskey
Hey, whiskey, what'd I ever do to you?

7 ContributorsDrugs Or Jesus Lyrics
In my home town
For anyone who sticks around
You're either lost or you're found
There's not much in between
In my home town
Everything's still black and white
It's a long, long way from wrong to right
From Sunday morning to Saturday night

Everybody just wants to get high
Sit and watch a perfect world go by
We're all looking for love and meaning in our lives
We follow the roads that lead us
To drugs or Jesus

My whole life
I've tried to run, I've tried to hide
From the stained glass windows in my mind
Refusing to let God's light shine
Down on me
Down on me

Everybody just wants to get high
Sit and watch a perfect world go by
We're all looking for love and meaning in our lives
There's not much space between us
Drugs or Jesus, yeah

Everybody wants acceptance
We all just want some proof
Everyone's just looking for the truth

Everybody just wants to get high
Sit and watch a perfect world go by
We're all looking for love and meaning in our lives
We follow the roads that lead us
To drugs or Jesus

To drugs or Jesus
Oh, I need ya, Jesus
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Song 100: You Don’t Love Me Anymore]
5 ContributorsYou Don’t Love Me Anymore Lyrics
She walks over to him and she says, "Do you remember me? I think we might have met somewhere before
Southern Carolina is the place that comes to mind, but hey, I guess you never really can be sure"

Oh, there's nothing like a true love to go and make a fool of someone just like before
And right there for a minute, I forgot that you don't love me anymore"

Then an old familiar feeling wraps its arms around the moment and he says, "So many times I've tried to call
Well, you think it's been a lifetime, it's been two years since I've seen you, but it seems just like no time's gone by at all

There was nothing like a real love to give you back the feel of someone just like before
And right there for a minute, I forgot that you don't love me anymore"

Oh, and how far we'll travel for a place to heal our hearts
We watched it unravel, so why's tonight the hardest part?

Then he says, "The weather's changing and it's icing up the highway, so I guess it's time for me to hit the road"
So she says, "Goodbye," and then, before she knows what she is saying, she says, "I wish you didn't have to go

Oh, there's nothing like a true love to go and make a fool of someone just like before
And right there for a minute, I forgot that you don't love me anymore"

And right there for a minute, I forgot that you don't love me anymore

6 ContributorsLove Me to Lie Lyrics
Yeah I know that you will always look away
When you don't know what to say
And you've been looking a lot lately
Yeah, we both know it might be a mistake
So even when we're bound to break
You still catch me when I'm fading
Wide awake at night knowing it ain't right
We both realize it might be over
Kills my heart to know you're gon' have to go
While you break it slow just let me hold you
'Cause I know

You must really love me to lie to me
Must really love me to lie to me
Must really love me to lie, lie to me
You make letting me go looking so easy
When I know that it can't be
You must really love me to lie, lie to me
Mmmm

Early days, had a crown up on our heads
King and queen with no regrets
And the kingdom was worth saving
Something changed
Now you're lying through your teeth
When you're lying next to me
Only pains when you're explainin'
Oh, I know, yeah I know now

You must really love me to lie to me
Must really love me to lie to me
Must really love me to lie, lie to me
You make letting me go looking so easy
When I know that it can't be
You must really love me to lie, lie (lie) to me
To me, ooh

Wide awake at night knowing it ain't right
We both realize it might be over
Kills my heart to know you gon' have to go
While you break it slow just let me hold you
'Cause I know...

You must really love me to lie to me
Must really love me to lie to me
Must really love me to lie, (to lie) lie (lie)
You make letting me go looking so easy
When I know that it can't be
You must really love me to lie, to lie
Oh, to lie

4 ContributorsThe Cowboy In Me (Yellowstone Edition) Lyrics
I don't know why I act the way I do
Like I ain't got a single thing to lose
Sometimes, I'm my own worst enemy
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

I got a life that most would love to have
Oh, but sometimes I still wake up fightin' mad
At where this road I'm headed down might lead
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The mе that's never satisfied
Thе face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

Mm

The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that's never satisfied
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

Girl, I know there's times you must have thought
There ain't a line you've drawn I haven't crossed
But you set your mind to see this love on through
I guess that's just the cowboy in you

We ride and never worry about the fall
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all
Yeah

Watching you stare down a sunset
Like you ain't found what you're looking for
Wishing that I could be it, but all I can be is yours
The girl on the downtown rooftop didn't care what people think
The girl before the boulevard of broken dreams, where is she?

Go on, try and find
The match that lit the fire that made you wild
I'll be here, take your time
Cry every single tear you need to cry
I can't fix the world, but I
I can hold you tonight

I don't ever want you to wonder
Who you might have been on your own
I don't ever wanna steal your thunder or steal your heart
I wanna be the one to still your soul

Go on, try and find
The match that lit the fire that made you wild
I'll be here, take your time
Cry every single tear you need to cry
I can't fix the world, but I
I can hold you tonight, oh, hold you tonight

Girl, they know a town could crumble
Who I love more than anything
Girl that makes me better than I could ever be
Where is she?

The match that lit the fire that made you wild

Cry every single tear you need to cry

[Song 104: Love Runs]
8 ContributorsLove Runs Lyrics
Love walks into a bar
And gets you to buy her a drink
Love walks you out to the dancefloor
Right when the band starts to sing
Love walks you to a corner booth
Into her life and back through yours
Love walks you out to her car
Right up to her front door

Then love runs through your veins
Like the wax of a candle flame
The first time that she says your name
And you just come undone
Then love runs through her hair
Like your fingers while you stare
Into her eyes, thinking she might be the one
When love walks, love runs

Love walks you through the calling
The calling up of her old man
Love walks you down the sandy aisle
To put forever on her hand
Love walks you through the highs and lows
Love walks you to your knees
Love walks you over that burning bridge
Between the fights and "I'm sorry"s

Then love runs through your veins
A little less night, a little more day
There's still a fire, there's still a flame
And you know she’s still the one
Then love runs you crazy like
A runaway train that runs your life
Way too fast and reckless, like a bullet from a gun
Love walks, love runs

One day love turns into war
Says, "I can't do this anymore"
Then one day, love walks out the door

Then love runs, fast as it can
After those tail lights for one more chance
Waving your broken heart in your hands
That kind of coming undone
Then love runs down your face
And it won’t stop until she hits the brakes
And you’re holding her in your arms
'Til that black sky turns to sun
Whoa
Love walks, love runs
Love walks, love runs
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, oh
Love walks, love runs

This is for the nobody
The one in the crowd who's got a
Lost look on his face
This is for the down trotted
The one that the world's forgotten
Waitin' on a better day
Well, I'm in no position to judge him
Heaven knows they're just like me

And I'm not alone and knowing what it's like
To wonder where you're going in this crazy life
And I'm not alone, knowing how it feels
To pray to God and sometimes wonder if he's real
'Cause I got friends that do, yeah, I got friends that do

This is for the lost junkie
Who spends all his hard earned money
On something that he hates
And this is for the found guilty
Who ain't getting out until he
Pays his debt to the state
I'm in no position to judge him
Heaven knows it could have been me

And I may not know what it's like
To lose your job 'cause a habit's got gripped too tight
And I may not know how it feels
To lay your head down on a prison bed in a world of steel
I got friends that do, yeah, I got friends that do

This is for yours truly
Just a little verse to remind me
We've all got somewhere to turn

And I may not know what it's like
To send my only soul to save the world and watch him die
And I may not know how it feels
To hang there on the cross to prove that love is real
But I got friends that do, yeah, I got friends that do

Yeah, I got friends that do
We know we all got friends that do

And without you, it's true I'd be free
To go chasin' all my dreams without any strings

But I wouldn't want it any other way
Havin' you to come home to at the end of every day
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way

Hard times may never let up on us
And maybe all we'll ever have will barely be enough
And, babe, you know how cold the wind can blow
Love has never let us down when we needed it the most

And I wouldn't want it any other way
Havin' you to come home to at the end of every day
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way


Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way
Wouldn't want it any other way
Any other way
Oh, girl
You know I love you more each day
Any other way

[Song 107: God Moves The Pen]
3 ContributorsGod Moves The Pen Lyrics
Shakespeare writing on a piece of paper
Hank Williams singing on an old guitar
Both of them trying to find the words
In somewhere up above the stars
But I've seen it there in old love letters
Stuck to the fridge on a post-it note
Red lipstick on a bathroom mirror
Or tucked in the pocket of a Cowboys coat

Written in the Sky
Written in the sand
On the back of a car dragging old tin cans
True love declared
Brushing paint
Way up there on a small town water tank
Carved in an oak
Or tattooed on the skin
Love moves the heart
God moves the pen

Saying “I miss you daddy” in blue Crayola
X’s and O’s in sidewalk chalk
I've seen "I heart Jenny" on an overpass
When the tongue is just too tired to talk

Written in the Sky
Written in the sand
On the back of a car dragging old tin cans
True love declared
Brushing paint
Way up there on a small town water tank
Carved in an oak
Or tattooed on the skin
Love moves the heart
God moves the pen
So write it in the Sky
Write it in the sand
On the back of a car dragging old tin cans
True love declared
With brushing paint
Way up there on a small town water tank
Carved in stone
Or tattooed on the skin
Love moves the heart
Love moves the heart
But God moves the pen

Wanna grab the phone, wanna call you up
Tell you that I'll take it just the way that it was
Every little fight, the makin' up all night

Back of the yellow cab, chasin' kisses in the dark

You always come back when I'm at my weakest
When I'm fool enough to let you in
Sayin' how this time around is different
Asking if I want to try again

I do, but I don't
I want to, but I won't
I am, but I ain't
I could, but I just can't
It feels right, but it's wrong
And I've hurt way too long
So when you ask me if I know what I want
I do, but I don't

What resistance I have left within me
I lose each time you're holdin' me this close
With every bitter sweet kiss, girl, you tempt me
Asking if I want to let you go

I do, but I don't
I want to, but I won't
I am, but I ain't
I could, but I just can't
It feels right, but it's wrong
And I've hurt way too long
When you ask me if I know what I want
I do, but I don't

So don't ask me if I know what I want
'Cause I do, but I don't

Call this an epiphany
Seein' the same things differently
Maybe mama's prayer caught up with me
Startin' to get it now

If my window to the world is the evening news
Only song I'll sing is gonna be the blues
Maybe happiness is a choice you choose
Startin' to get it now

Got a flatbed Ford and four good tires
Biscuits in the oven, chicken in the fryer
Lights turned on, cable paid
If you asked me, I got it made
If I could hug my kids and kiss my wife
One more day in this crazy life
Take a second to stop and smell the daisies
Everything else is gravy

Got the classics playing on my radio
Promises to keep and miles to go
Still dreaming of the cherry red GTO
Even if I'll never get it

Got a flatbed Ford and four good tires
Biscuits in the oven, chicken in the fryer
Lights turned on, cable paid
If you asked me, I got it made
If I could hug my kids and kiss my wife
One more day in this crazy life
Take a second to stop and smell the daisies
Everything else is gravy

Starch fresh-pressed Sunday shirt
Dinner after church
Holdin' hands and prayers are prayed
Hot fried chicken, cold lemonade

If I can hug my kids and kiss my wife
Live one more day in this crazy life
Lay my body down and hold my baby
I know the good Lord'll save me
Everything else is gravy

[Song 112: Seventeen]
5 ContributorsSeventeen Lyrics
Backseat of her daddy's car
I was trying not to go too far
Kept thinking 'bout the words the preacher man said
Lightning flashed across the sky
I saw love in a young girl's eyes
And that's a look you never forget

Seventeen only comes once in a lifetime
Don't it just fly by, wild and free?
Going any way the wind blew, baby
Seventeen, living on crazy dreams
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans
And standing on the edge of everything
Seventeen

Legs hanging off the Bayou Bridge
Feeding fish potato chips
And talking 'bout the mysteries of the universe
Yeah, the world was somewhere else
We had the summer all to ourselves
And the stars went off like fireworks

Seventeen only comes once in a lifetime
Don't it just fly by, wild and free?
Going any way the wind blew, baby
Seventeen, living on crazy dreams
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans
And standing on the edge of everything
Seventeen
Seventeen only comes once in a lifetime
Well, don't it just fly by, wild and free?
Going any way the wind blew, baby
Seventeen, living on crazy dreams
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans
And standing on the edge of everything
Seventeen

Yeah, seventeen
Sweet seventeen

[Song 113: Damn Good at Holding On]
4 ContributorsDamn Good at Holding On Lyrics
Oh, kiss me baby
Tell me that you love me, even though I know sometimes you hate me
We spend most of our days together
With you tryin' to change me
Saying that I drive you crazy
Come on honey
Let me remind you
How you can't resist me in the dark somehow
And it'll all makes sense when we're skin on skin
We're lying down
Yeah, you remember now

The sky is made from empty space and stars
And our love is made from lonely broken hearts
And the only thing that keeps us from being gone
Is that we're damn good at holding on

It's more than a stubborn baby
We were playing with matches
We were glued together from the green light glow
From a million miles an hour to settling into something sweet and slow
I'm the owner of that heart you stole

The sky is made from empty space and stars
And our love is made from lonely broken hearts
And the only thing that keeps us from being gone
Is that we're damn good at holding on

And it hasn't changed much
We're either tearing it up or fixing it
It's a white-knuckle month
We're jumping
We keep jumping in

'Cause the sky got made from empty space and stars
And our love is made from lonely broken hearts
Sometimes the only thing that keeps us where we are
Is that we're damn good at holding on
Holding on
Is that we're damn good at holding on
Damn good at holding on

4 Contributors40 Days and 40 Nights Lyrics
Well, it's been rainin' on and on ever since you've been gone, those dark clouds keep a-rollin' in
And every time I think I might catch myself a glimpse of sunlight, the bottom falls out again

Well, I can barely keep afloat, I'm up the creek without a boat and I've been a-driftin' Heaven knows how long
'Cause it's been rainin' forty days and the forty nights since you've been gone

Hey, well, drip, drip, drip, goes the sound of the rain
The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane
My friends said I should settle for any port in a storm
I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms, safe and warm

Girl, it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine, baby, won't you come back home?
'Cause it's been rainin' forty days and the forty nights since you've been gone

Aw, listen to me now
I keep starin' out the window, searchin' for a rainbow to signal that the storm will end
Hey, 'cause I know that the rain will keep pourin' on the pane until my saint comes back marchin' in

Oh, girl, it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine, baby, won't you come back home?
'Cause it's been rainin' forty days and the forty nights since you've been gone

Hey, well, drip, drip, drip, goes the sound of the rain
The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane
My friends said I should settle for any port in a storm
I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms, safe and warm

Girl, it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine, baby, won't you come back home?
'Cause it's been rainin' forty days and the forty nights since you've been gone
Yeah, it's been rainin' forty days and the forty nights since you've been gone

[Song 115: Tiny Dancer]
8 ContributorsTiny Dancer Lyrics
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, she was a seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, she'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the song
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I sing softly, slowly

And hold me closer, tiny dancer
And count the headlights on the highway
And lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, she was a seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, yeah, she married a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her, she was dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

And hold me closer, tiny dancer
And count the headlights on the highway
And lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
And hold me closer, tiny dancer
And count the headlights on the highway
And lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

[Song 116: Not from California]
7 ContributorsNot from California Lyrics
I'm more mountains and rivers
Than oceans and waves
I'm more moonshine and whiskey
Than vineyards and grapes
I'm more back roads and dives
Than Hollywood signs
I'm more sit by the jukebox
Than lines out the door

No, I'm not from California
I'm from somewhere you ain't any more

I'm more stars in the sky
Than stars on the sidewalk
I'm more old wooden pew
Than bench on the boardwalk
I'm more kiss you and mean it
Than love you and leave it
I'm more roots in the ground
Than footprints on the shore

No, I'm not from California
I'm from somewhere you ain't any more

You're out there dreamin'
While I'm back here drinkin' over us
No, I'm not from California
But tonight I wish I was

I'm more act tough and fake it
Than find a flight and take it
But I'm too late to say I'm sorry
For all I'm sorry for
I'm not from California
But you can't say I didn't warn you
That I'm the guy who's gonna die
Right where he was born

No, I'm not from California
I'm from somewhere you ain't any more

[Song 117: If I Was a Cowboy]
6 ContributorsIf I Was a Cowboy Lyrics
If highways were dirt roads, streetlights were stars
Mustangs were horses, I'd walk outta this bar
A cigarette and a Stetson and whiskey in my veins
I'd climb back in the saddle and grab ahold of the reins

If I was a cowboy, I wouldn't miss you at all
A shot of Jack and Marlboro, I'd move on, girl, feelin' ten feet tall
I'd ride off into the sunset out west
Never let your memory ever tie me down
If I was a cowboy, I'd be over you by now

You'd be ashes in a campfire, water under a bridge
A trail of dust behind me, you'd never find me again

If I was a cowboy, I wouldn't miss you at all
A shot of Jack and Marlboro, I'd move on, girl, feelin' ten feet tall
I'd ride off into the sunset out west
Never let your memory ever tie me down
If I was a cowboy, I'd be over you by now

Let my boots down in a new town
Find a nail to hang my hat
And you wouldn't kill me, and I wouldn't still be
Wishin' you'd come back

If I was a cowboy, I wouldn't miss you at all
A shot of Jack and Marlboro, I'd move on, girl, feelin' ten feet tall
I'd ride off into the sunset out west
Never let your memory ever tie me down
If I was a cowboy, I'd be over you by now

[Song 118: L.A.]
6 ContributorsL.A. Lyrics
I like to watch the waves crashin' on the beach
And walking the strand In that evening breeze
That old ferris wheel out on the pier in Santa Monica
Looks like it does in the movies

I don’t mind the traffic on the 405
In fact, it's where I met a good friend of mine
All gridlocked, stopped and stuck there killing time
Long way from home, but that's alright

I guess I’m getting used to the faster pace
And seein' stars on the boulevard every night and day
But all this cool and crazy beautiful takes second place
'Cause the thing that I love most about LA is you

The city of angels, ain't that the truth?
'Cause Heaven don't feel far away when I'm holdin' on to you
And how you fell for a boy in faded jeans and cowboy boots
Girl, I still ain’t got a clue

I guess I’m getting used to the faster pace
And seein' stars on the boulevard every night and day
But all this cool and crazy beautiful takes second place
’Cause the thing that I love most about LA is you

I guess I'm getting used to the faster pace
And seein' stars on the boulevard every night and day
But all this cool and crazy beautiful takes second place
'Cause the thing that I love most about LA
And the only reason that I’m gonna stay, girl, is you

[Song 119: Blank Sheet Of Paper]
5 ContributorsBlank Sheet Of Paper Lyrics
I am just a blank sheet of paper
This fool's about to write you a letter
To tell you that he's sorry
For the way he did you wrong
To ask for your forgiveness
For leaving you alone
He's been looking down at me
Seems like forever
He takes the top on and off his pen
It's like he can't decide
Just what he wants to say
If he'd just tell the truth
I'd be on my way

But he just stares at me
And I just stare at him
He don't know where to start
To say he doesn't want it to end
Now it’s one hour later
And I am still a blank sheet of paper

Sunlight is shining through the curtains
He's almost asleep pen in hand
There's a tear in his eye
That refuses to fall
If it would land on me
That would say it all

But he just stares at me
And I just stare at him
He don't know where to start
To say he doesn't want it to end
Now it’s four hours later
And I am still a blank sheet of paper

And he just stares at me
And I just stare at him
He don't know where to start
To say he wants it back again
Now, one broken heart later
I am still a blank sheet of paper

4 ContributorsChristmas All Over The World Lyrics
In the desert they’re hanging Christmas lights
From a cactus Christmas tree
And all the way over the sea
In Tokyo, they’re hanging mistletoe

And way down south in Mexico
They’re singing Feliz Navidad
And over in Leningrad
Where the white lights glow
They’re dancing in the snow

And the bells, the bells
The bells are ringing
The joy, the joy, the joy
They’re bringing
For every boy and girl
It’s Christmas time, all over the world

From Romania to Pennsylvania
They’re watching for that sleigh
Over in China Town
Someone saw him flying round
You know they can hardly wait
You might say Joyeux Noël
You might say Buon Natale
It won’t make a difference to me
No matter where you are
It’s gonna warm your heart

When the bells, the bells
The bells are ringing
The joy, the joy
The joy they’re bringing
The bells, the bells
The bells are ringing
For every boy and girl

Yeah the bells, the bells
The joy, the joy
For every boy and girl
It’s Christmas time, all over the world
All over the world

[Song 122: All I Want Is a Life]
6 ContributorsAll I Want Is a Life Lyrics
I just want to get a little more out of my payday
Finally own a car that doesn't break down on the freeway
A little vacation ain't asking very much
I hate coming home to this old broken-down apartment
I wish I had a dime for every hole that's in the carpet
I don't want it all, but I ain't got enough

All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs, I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

I don't mind the hours and the pain that comes from working
But it's enough to kill me when I see my baby hurting
Wanna give her that diamond I never got to buy
She keeps telling me that everything is getting better
But one step up the rung and someone knocks me off the ladder
Just want to break even someday before I die

All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs, I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

Oh, all I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs, I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

All I want
Is a life
All I want
Is a life

4 ContributorsWho Are They? Lyrics
They say not to have too much fun
They say not to get too much sun
Democrat, Republican
I guess I'm screwed, I'm neither one
Don't say "Hell", say "What the heck"
Do what's politically correct
Don't pray in school, but have safe sex
Isn't that what they expect?

Who are they?
Yeah, you know what they say
Who are they?
Someone I gotta pay
Who are they?
They're probably living in LA
And I don't care anyway
Who are they?

They probably own the Village Voice
The Nashville Scene, The People's Choice
To me, it's all a bunch of noise
Decided on by funny boys
They say who does and don't belong
They say our hair's too short or long
They say who's right and who is wrong
As if we'll all just come along

Who are they?
Yeah, you know what they say
Who are they?
Someone I gotta pay
Who are they?
They're probably living in LA
And I don't care anyway
Who are they?

Well, I wonder if they've got a life
A broken car and two ex-wives
Do they drink beer on Friday night?
I wonder if they like to fight
And I wonder if they've got a soul
Or if they like their rock-and-roll
Where do they live? I've got to know
So I can tell them off
Or where to go

Who are they?
Yeah, you know what they say
Who are they?
Someone I gotta pay
Who are they?
They're probably living in LA
And I don't care anyway
Who are they?

Well, I don't care anyway
Who are they?
They're probably living out in LA
Who are they?
Aw, you know what they say
Who are they?
Who are they?

Who are they?

[Song 124: Losin’ You]
5 ContributorsLosin’ You Lyrics
You're in the blue breeze blowin'
Across the sugar white sand
And the roar of the wheels
When I'm tryin' to land
In a Hank Williams tune
And a Coltrane song
In the dead of the night
And at the break of dawn
It never gets old
And it's always new
Everywhere I go
I keep on losin' you

In the words of a poet
No one reads anymore
In the shadows and sunlight
Crawling across the floor
In airport lounges
In motel rooms
In the Starbucks line
Under quarter moons
Between the little white lies
And the cold hard truth
Is everywhere I am
Girl, I'm still losin' you

Yeah, you kissed me one last time
Made that driveway gravel fly
Red taillights lit like a spark
Just the start of a long goodbye
And some memories just won't fade
Not a damn thing you can do
So, girl, if you're long gone
How come I keep on losin' you?

In Seattle and Vegas
Old rodeos
And lonesome dove
And the last pictue show
In a truck stop parking lot
Gasoline rainbow
The burn of the whiskey
Neon smoke
I close my eyes
And you're right there

Yeah, you kissed me one last time
Made that driveway gravel fly
Red taillights lit like a spark
Just the start of a long goodbye
And some memories just won't fade
Not a damn thing you can do
So, girl, if you're long gone
How come I keep on losin' you?

Missin' you
Red wine, slow dance, kissin' you
Late night drivin'
Wishin' you were still here
Turnin' that radio
Searchin' for a song to listen to

And some memories just won't fade
Not a damn thing you can do
So girl if you're long gone
How come I keep on losin' you?
Guess I'll keep holdin' on
And I'll keep on losin' you
Missin' you
Red wine, slow dance, kissin' you
Searchin' for a song to listen to

Born and raised eighteen years
Baptized and saved in a million beers
Nobody famous lives 'round here
And I’m okay with that
She's a drama, she's a mama, she’s my country queen
I bust my ass on big machines
Promised her forever at seventeen
And I'm okay with that

Don't call us small town
Never have been, never will
It's a cold beer sundown
And we eat what we kill
We marry angels and dance with the devil in a place where time stands still
Can I get an "Amen", for livin' in, Hallelujahville?

Sunday supper, we pass the biscuits
Save the grease from cast-iron skillets
DC's broke and we can't fix it
And we're okay with that
We quote King James like a Waylon song
Pray at night, make love ’til dawn
Love us or leave us the Hell alone
Hope you’re okay with that

Don't call us small town
Never have been, never will
It’s a big time sundown
Little house up on the hill
We marry angels and dance with the devil in a place where time stands still
Can I get an "Amen", for livin' in, Hallelujahville?
Hallelujahville

She's sitting by my side
Dirt road, slow ride
And there's no place that I’d rather be tonight

Baby, this is our town
Always has been, always will
Pour it out at sundown
Hope someday we get our fill
We ain't angels and we run from the devil in a place where time stands still
Can I get an "Amen", yeah for livin' in, Hallelujahville?
Hallelujahville

(Hallelujah)
Hallelujahville (Hallelujah)
Hallelujahville (Hallelujah, Hallelujah)

I thought I felt you touch my cheek this morning
But I must have been dreaming
And in the middle of the night without a warning
I thought I heard you breathing
Me and my so-called independence
I have got this loneliness that is so relentless

I guess you get used to somebody
Kind of like having them around
I guess you get used to the way they make you happy
Bring you up when you are feeling down
I never dreamed when I was letting you go that
I would wake up and miss you this much
I guess you get used to somebody
I guess you get used to being loved

I Kind of miss those rambling conversations
Where we would talk about nothing
The way you always made me laugh at my frustrations
Baby that was something
I should have been careful what I wished for
Because I have got my freedom and so much more

I guess you get used to somebody
Kind of like having them around
I guess you get used to the way they make you happy
Bring you up when you are feeling down
I never dreamed when I was letting you go that
I would wake up and miss you this much
I guess you get used to somebody
I guess you get used to being loved

I never dreamed when I was letting you go that

Devoted my life, to huntin' and fishin'
I'd never be anybody else's lovesick fool
It ain’t cool
I spend all my spare time, fixin' up
That old rusted up pick-up truck
In no time at all I'd have it lookin' like brand new
Then you

Flipped the switch on my dumaflache
Played my piano like Liberace
I let down my guard
And my heart was good as gone, so long
Yeah, you cranked my tractor, you flicked my bic
Woman you tripped the trigger on my thingamajig
Can't explain how you done it
But, honey, you turn me on

Your love done all the takin', I done all the givin'
I threw up my hands, said, "The heck with it"
I shut down my heart
Locked it up and pulled the fuse, before it blew
All my emotions were disconnected
No sign of a spark, could be detected
I had nobody, so I had nothin' to lose
Then you

Flipped the switch on my dumaflache
Played my piano like Liberace
I let down my guard
And my heart was good as gone, so long
Yeah, you cranked my tractor, you flicked my bic
Woman you tripped the trigger on my thingamajig
Can't explain how you done it
But, honey, you turn me on

My my my my my my Mexicoma

But the sun still shines on a fool like me

You pulled the plug, on what I thought was love
But I got just enough juice to forget about you and squeeze this lime
I can see the ocean (I can see the ocean)
I can feel the breeze (I can feel the breeze)
Almost can't remember how you left me, down here on my knees

Sure was good to know you
I still wanna hold you
But I know it's over

I don't need no wake up call
'Cause I can't close my eyes
When I do you're all I see

Girl you started a fire in me
And I can't put it out

I think it's the real thing baby

What about you
Love's the only thing that makes me feel like I do
Baby, what about you

If you dial my number
And I'm not at home
I left you a message
On my corded phone
If anyone else calls tonight
They'll think I've lost my mind
'Cause it says "I love you! I love you! I love you!" a million times

'N' I think it's the real thing baby
What about you

I was running late again, picking up a few things
And there you were on aisle thirteen
I felt that old rush, when you saw me you blushed
Like you did when you were sweet sixteen
They said you looked lost on the dance floor
With a lonely look in your eyes
Don't know why I didn't show, to this day I still don't know
For once I wish I hadn't thought twice
Then your folks split up and you moved to Colorado
And I headed out to Tennessee
Heard you got married and you moved back home
Here we are again, you and me

It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes shines like the ring on your hand
Annie, I owe you a dance

Don't the years fly by in the blink of an eye?
Yeah, loves, I've had a few
I've been a million places and I've seen a million faces
But I couldn't stop thinking 'bout you
Remember how we'd talk for hours?
Keeping each other's secrets
Made a promise I'd take you to homecoming
But, Annie, I didn't keep it
Almost called you up when I played in Boulder
But I thought I'd just let it be
Heard you found yourself a real good man
Do you ever think of you and me?

It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes shines like the ring on your hand
Annie, I owe you a dance

So put your groceries in the basket, I'm so sorry, now I'm asking
Like I should have twenty years ago
And I know it's all over, I'm just looking for some closure
And there's a song on the radio
You give me your hand and we start to dance
The cashier gives us a smile
As you turn and walk away, I hear your little girl say
"Momma, who was that guy?"

I shouldn't be surprised the forgiveness in your eyes gave me a second chance
Annie, thanks for the dance

[Song 131: You Had To Be There]
4 ContributorsYou Had To Be There Lyrics
He sat down, picked up the phone said boy, I'm your old man
He touched the glass between the two as if to shake his hand
The boy he didn't budge, not even so much as a blink
The man said
Oh, come on better late than never, don't you think?
He said I read it in the paper, can't believe you're 21
Can't believe some son of mine could do the things I hear you've done
He went on like some big hero who flew in to save the day
And the boy said, If you're here to scare me right man, it's too late

You had to be there
And I'm talkin' from day one
That's the only time a man should talk through glass to his new son
And you'd have to go back and teach me how when I was nine
'Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball even if she had the time
And I should have been learnin' how to fish instead of learnin' how to smoke
I bet if you'd have whooped my tail I'd never thought it was a joke
He said sometimes the will for doin' wrong is way too strong for any Mama's prayers
You had to be there

The man said boy, I'm sorry that you hate me like you do
The boy said, dry it up, man, we ain't makin' this about you
It's about a teenage girl against the world who was left there high and dry
About a kid who might have stood a whole lot better shot at life

But you had to be there
And I'm talkin' from day one
That's the only time a man should talk through glass to his new son
And you'd have to go back and teach me how when I was nine
'Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball even if she had the time
I should have been learnin' how to fish instead of learnin' how to smoke
I bet if you'd have whooped my tail I'd never thought it was a joke
He said sometimes the will for doin' wrong is way too strong for any Mama's prayers
You had to be there

Before the boy hung up the phone
He said, they say I'm out of time
And it hit the man right there and then
My God, son, so am I

[Song 132: Friend Of A Friend]
3 ContributorsFriend Of A Friend Lyrics
I heard it from a friend of a friend
You're living out in LA now
Got a studio apartment, couple blocks off the beach
Doing yoga in the evenings, you love the kids you teach

I heard it from a friend of a friend
You met somebody in a coffee shop
You've been going out now, for going on ten months
You already met his family, things are heating up

Don't you believe, anything you hear
When someone tells you, I still ask about you
After all these years
No matter what they say, it's just not true
I don't spend all my days and all my nights
Just missing you

I heard it from a friend of a friend
You looked amazing in that long white gown
With flowers in your hair, barefoot in the sand
Your daddy almost broke down when he gave away your hand

But don't you believe, anything you hear
When someone tells you, I still ask about you
After all these years
No matter what they say, it's just not true
I don't spend all my days and all my nights
Just missing you

I heard it from a friend of a friend
He didn't mean it when he took those vows
You've been staying with your mama, a couple weeks now
Been asking everybody about me

I heard it from a friend of a friend
I heard it from a friend of a friend

[Song 133: Why We Said Goodbye]
4 ContributorsWhy We Said Goodbye Lyrics
I remember Sunday mornin's
Walkin' on the beach
And that place we'd stop for breakfast
With the old red vinyl seats
The hours of the tide chart
The way the sunlight danced upon your face

That antique roller coaster
You just had to ride
I remember how you laughed
At the terror in my eyes
The color and the detail
Just like it was yesterday

And I remember how you held me
The night my father died
I didn't have to tell you
I just broke down and cried
You are sewn into the fabric
The pieces of my life
And I just cannot remember why
We said goodbye

Up and down this boardwalk
Lonely people sit
I know it wasn't perfect
But nothin' ever is
The sails out in the harbor
Are searchin' for the wind

I just had to call you
I had to hear your voice
And tell you I still love you
We still have a choice
You're sewn into the fabric
The pieces of my life
And I just can't remember why
We said goodbye

Everything I do
Leads back to you
I know
I just can't let us go

There must have been a reason
But I can't remember now
I know if I could hold you
We could work it out
You're sewn into the fabric
The pieces of my life
And girl let's give it one more try
'Cause I just can't remember why
We said goodbye

[Song 134: Don’t Make Me Feel at Home]
7 ContributorsDon’t Make Me Feel at Home Lyrics
Room number 10 at the Holiday Inn
I softly knocked upon the door
Both excited and ashamed
I slipped off my ring
Somethin' I'd never done before
The door open wide she welcomed me inside
Took my coat and offered me a drink
I just shook my head
I sat down on the bed
I looked her in the eye
And said, "No thanks"

"Don't make me feel at home
'Cause there ain't nothin there but wood and stone
Loneliness is all I feel inside those walls
And I can't go home
Please make me feel the way
She hasn't made me feel in way too long
Warm me with your touch
Make me feel loved
Don't make me feel at home"

There's no love at home
Is it right or is it wrong?
Does it matter if no one really cares?
When she took my hand
I told her once again
As I took the ribbon from her hair

"Don't make me feel at home
'Cause there ain't nothin there but wood and stone
Loneliness is all I feel inside those walls
And I can't go home
Please make me feel the way
She hasn't made me feel in way too long
Warm me with your touch
Make me feel loved
Don't make me feel at home
Warm me with your touch
Make me feel loved
Don't make me feel at home"

[Song 135: Between The River And Me]
5 ContributorsBetween The River And Me Lyrics
I was fifteen when my daddy died
Mama worked two jobs just to get by
Seemed like a blessing when Harley came around
So she took his name but I had my doubts
Didn't take long for his drinking ways
To start showing up on mama's face
One violent night hiding under my bed
I swore that he wouldn't see another sunset
Next day I followed him down to the riverbank
I knew one of us wouldn't walk away

I might have had a plan but he didn't know it
I might have been scared but I didn't show it
That's all between the river and me
With the current and the rocks, it could have been risky
He might have been sober but I brought the whiskey
That's all between the river and me

I walked up to him and I said his name
Just so he could see the look on my face
We stood eye to eye and toe to toe
When I told him that he wasn't gonna come back home
He raised his fist to me but I didn't flinch
I said 'I ain't your son you son of a bitch'

I might have had a knife in my back pocket
I might have pulled it out before he saw it
That's all between the river and me
I might have had a gun but I didn't fire it
He might have tried to yell but I kept him quiet
That's all between the river and me
That's all between the river and me


Sheriff came knocking on our front door
They said they found his body by the reservoir
Bottle in his shirt and liquor in his blood
He must have fallen in the river and he never came up

There might have been blood but they never saw it
Just a little mud on the living room carpet
That's all between the river and me
Well, after what he done, there ain't no wonder
I can't remember how long I held him under
That's all between the river and me

That's all between the river and me
That's all between the river and me
That's all
That's all

[Song 136: If I Died Today]
3 ContributorsIf I Died Today Lyrics
If I died today
Who'd turn off my coffee pot
Would there be a street parade
Would I just be an after-thought

If I died today
Would I still be a waiter?
Could I fly around like superman
Would I make the Sunday paper

I wonder who I'd see
Cryin' standin' over me
Who would just send their regards
Would anybody say that "at least he's in a better place"
And who would get this old guitar

If I died today
Would my mama keep on praying'
Would my buddies go out drinking
Would my alarm clock keep on blinking'

If I died today
Would I need to be ashamed
Would I be easy to forget
Could I live with my regrets

I wonder who I'd see
Cryin' standin' over me
Who would just send their regards
Would anybody say that "at least he's in a better place"
And who would get this old guitar

If I died today
Would I see my room from Heaven
Would my family talk about me
At Christmas and Thanksgivin'

I wonder who I'd see
Cryin' standin' over me
Who would just send their regards
Would anybody say that "at least he's in a better place"
And who would get this old guitar

If I died today
Who'd turn off my coffee pot?

[Song 137: Somebody Must Be Prayin’ for Me]
6 ContributorsSomebody Must Be Prayin’ for Me Lyrics
She left Oklahoma for California, sunglasses on the brim of her hat
Smoke was pouring from that old Cadillac, but she wasn't turning back
Just outside of Flagstaff, motor blew on her Coup De Ville
Just in time, she saw a sign, there's was a Texaco waiting at the bottom of the hill
And she said

Somebody must be praying for me
Somebody out there must be praying for me
Must be angels I can't see
Somebody must be praying for me
Yeah

A boy about twenty climbed out of a truck, all covered in grease and dirt
She said, "Hey, Charles," but he just laughed, he said, "I'm wearing my daddy's shirt"
He stood there lost in her eyes, then she got lost in his
As the years roll by, she would sigh every time they kissed
And she'd say

Somebody must be praying for me
Somebody out there must be praying for me
Must be angels I can't see
Somebody must be praying for me

Sometimes she stares out the window and wonders about her Hollywood dreams
But when she tucks her kids in bed, she softly whispers as they fall asleep

Somebody must be praying for me
Somebody out there must be praying for me
Ain't it funny how you always find just what you need?
Somebody must be praying for me

Yeah
Somebody must be praying for me
Praying for me
Yeah

[Song 138: Unbroken]
5 ContributorsUnbroken Lyrics
If I lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall
If I walked around at all, it was in bits and pieces
Of a jagged heart
You kissed me and every piece went back in place
Every pain got erased
You held me up to the sunlight
Now it feels like

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile fill my soul again
I am unbroken

If I doubted the power of love, baby now I understand
I thank God for every day I wake up to the soft touch
Of your magic hands
In this world sometimes the only thing that's real is the way you make me feel
Babe, the changes day and night
I swear it's life

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile fill my soul again
I am unbroken

I still see the night, I fell into your eyes
And when we made love it felt like the first time

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile fill my soul again
I am unbroken
I am unbroken
I am unbroken

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You are here, now my heart's unbroken
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken...

[Song 139: Wherever the Trail May Lead]
6 ContributorsWherever the Trail May Lead Lyrics
Come with me, and let's go wander
Far beyond the wild blue yonder
Out where stars roam free
Though the journey's far from breezy
Stick with me, I'll make it easy
You can depend on me

Yeah, there's a long road before us
And it's a hard road, indeed
But darlin', I swear
I'll get us there
Wherever the trail may lead

Once we cross that far horizon
Life is bound to be surprisin'
But we'll take it day by day
Never mind the wind and weather
If we walk that trail together
Somehow we'll find our way

Yeah, there's a long road before us
And it's a hard road, indeed
But darlin', I vow
We'll get through somehow
Wherever the trail may lead

Can't tell you when we'll be there
It may take all our lives
We're headedfor that great unknown
We'll soon be walkin' free there
'Til that day arrives
At least we won't be travellin' alone

And there's a long road before us
And it's a hard road, indeed
But darlin', don't fear
'Cause I'll be right here
To give you the strength you need
And through the whole ride
I'll be by your side
Wherever the trail may lead

[Song 140: War of Art]
5 ContributorsWar of Art Lyrics
I  don't do it for the money
I don't do it for the fame
I don't do it so I can see the bright lights
Spell out my name
But I'd be lyin' if I said I didn't wanna hear my songs
On a jukebox in a jukebox kinda bar
Guess I'm just another soldier
Fightin' a war of art

And I love the pretty girls and how they sway
In rhythm when I play
And I'll take a free cold beer everytime
They set one on a stage
And if that was the only reason, why I do it
Then why I do it wouldn't get me very far
I guess you can't pick your battles
When you fight the war of art

It's hard to shine in a sky full of stars
Still be who you are
When you fight the war of art

If a bullet was a song, and this guitar was a gun
I'd knock 'em dead
Most nights it feels like I'm the one
Up here bleedin' red
And I ain't tryin' to hurt nobody, I'm just hopin' that my broken
Puts some hope, in another broken heart
Yeah, I'm just another soldier
Fightin' a war of art

It's hard to shine in a sky full of stars
Still be who you are
When you fight the war of art

I don't do it for the money
I don't do it for the fame

[Song 141: Kiss a Girl]
7 ContributorsKiss a Girl Lyrics
So you meet her outside the club
And neither one of you is lookin' for love
Everybody’s leavin', she gives you her number
You think you might call her
It’s just another in the long line of lonely hearts

You turn around to say goodbye
Everything else you ever felt feels like a lie
Then your eyes meet, and everything changes
You can’t remember your own name

And it’s cherry red sweet, boy
You don’t know you’re gonna change your world
When you kiss a girl

Then it’s roses, roller coasters and Panama City
A million tan bodies, none of them are as pretty
Sundresses scattered on the hardwood floor
And it’s not your bathroom anymore
You think you’re gonna faint at the justice of the peace
You wake up next to her, the sun rises in the east

And it’s sleepy and warm, boy
You don’t know you’re gonna change your world
When you kiss a girl

She knows what you’re thinkin' before you can think it
Says she’s not thirsty when she takes yours and drinks it
She’s an angel from heaven, stubborn as hell
She knows all your secrets but she’ll never tell

A few ups, a few downs, makeups and fights
She wakes you up in the middle of the night
She says it’s time, you hear that baby cry
Then you finally realize the reason why

You kissed some girl
Oh, you kiss a girl
You kissed the girl

My body burns
Like there's a desert deep in me
A thirsty soul so unsatisfied
But there you are like a river to the sea
The one chance I have to change my life

Darlin', take my away from here
Make it seem like we're a million miles away
Another time another place
Make me a different man
Move me farther than I've ever been before
Show me that there's something more

Sometimes I feel like I'm trapped inside myself
Spinning wheels up and down, 'round and 'round
Going no where just like everybody else
With no touch, no sight, no sound

But you could take me away from here
Make it seem like we're a million miles away
Another time another place
Make me a different man
Move me farther than I've ever been before
Show me that there's something more
Give me hopes and dreams to fill my head
Push my heart so I can fly again

Take me away from here
Make it seem like we're a million miles away
Another time another place
Make me a different man
Move me farther than I've ever been before
Show me that there's something more

Take me away from here
Take me away from here
Take me away from here
Take me away from here
Take me away from here

5 ContributorsA Place in the Sun Lyrics
Long ago, far away
I felt your loving glow upon my face
Was it a dream or just a promise made?
What is my destiny?

Someday, I'll find a way to shine
Leave all these rainy days behind
I know there's got to be
Some place warm and bright for me
I'm running out of places I can run
Looking for a place in the sun

Darkness hangs overhead
Close to the point where angels fear to tread
I close my eyes and think of you instead
And pray you'll be here soon

Someday, I'll find a way to shine
Leave all these rainy days behind
I know there's got to be
Some place warm and bright for me
I'm running out of places I can run
Looking for a place in the sun

Sometimes, it feels like this whole world's against me
And every beaten path is just another winding road that tempts me
Far from you and all that's true
I've got to find my way again
Yeah

Someday, I'll find a way to shine
Leave all these rainy days behind
I know there's got to be
Some place warm and bright for me
I'm running out of places I can run
Looking for a place in the sun
Yeah, I'm running out of places I can run
Looking for a place in the sun

Yeah, oh
Won't you shine down on me, sunshine? Yeah
Oh, Lord

[Song 144: City Lights]
4 ContributorsCity Lights Lyrics
She was like a brand new song on an old guitar
Supernova in a Mason jar
Every boy in town wanted to show her around
As a dirt road, fence row, kudzu king
Beating along this American dream
Wrecked out the truck when she showed up
She had a fire inside her faraway eyes
And I knew just where to take her that night

And we got high on top of that ridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton and the river bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night
She's city lights

She's like a broken heart you can't wait to have
A shooting star that falls too fast
Try holding on, it's already gone
I searched that radio low and high
Tryin' to find a song to make a memory by
And I did alright, for a small town guy
But even in my arms I knew
I'd never shine as bright as her city lights do

We got high on top of that ridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton and the river bridge
When the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night
She's city lights
We got high on top of that ridge
We could see for miles, past the corn and the cotton and the river bridge
And when the sun went down, there she was
Shinning like a big old sky full of diamond dust
I'm a cigarette burnin' slow on a summer night
She's city lights
She's city lights
She's my city lights, city lights
She's my city lights, city lights
She's my city lights, city lights
She's my city lights, city lights
She's my city lights, city lights

[Song 145: Mary And Joseph]
3 ContributorsMary And Joseph Lyrics
Mary was the first of three
Long black hair and sugar sweet
Daddy's eyes and Momma's crooked smile
She was barely seventeen
Got a job keeping dishes clean
Planned to stay in this city for a while
For a while

Joseph ran a lumber yard
About a mile from Olive park
Quiet boy, he never had much to say

It was love right from the start
He bought a ring and won Mary's heart
Had hopes for a home and kids someday
Kids someday

The angel scared her half to death
She would've screamed but she lost her breath
On a midnight there in the middle of May

He said "Oh Mary, don't be afraid
You'll bear a son that the Lord has made
Call him Jesus, He'll light the way"

She packed the clothes, he made the plans
They had to go to Bethlehem
But there was nowhere left to stay

So in a barn she gave birth
To the King of Kings, the Lord of Earth
Just a little bitty thing sleeping on the hay
Sleeping on the hay

The story's too long to tell
But He walked on water and lived through hell
Killed on a cross and rose from the grave

We got a King, they got a Son
Mary and Joseph were the only ones
There on that very first Christmas day
There on that very first Christmas day

Redneck girl likes to cruise in daddy's pickup truck
And a redneck girl plays her heart when she's down on her luck
Living for Friday afternoon
She's gonna show one ol' boy that weekend moon
And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
A redneck girl likes to stay out all night long
She makes sweet rock and roll while she listens to the country songs
She's waiting on the moment of surrender
Her hands are callused but her heart is tender

And I pray that someday I will find me a rеdneck girl
Oh, give me a, givе me a, give me a redneck girl
Give me a, give me a, give me a redneck girl

Yeah, give me a, give me a, give me a redneck girl
Give me a, give me a, give me a redneck girl

Redneck girl got her name on the back of her belt
She's got a kiss on her lips for her man and no one else
The Coyote's howling out on the prairie
First comes love and then comes marriage

And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
Yeah, give me a, give me a, give me a redneck girl
Give me a, give me a, give me a redneck girl
Oh, give me a, give me a, give me a Mississippi girl
Make mine from Colorado, Tim, alright

We are the black haired girls
With the streaks of red
And 10,000 sky-blue seats
In an open air shed
Hearin' that thunder bass drum kick
As the amplifiers scream
We are the neon midnight riders
On a field of broken dreams

Long as the good lords willin’ and the creek don’t rise
Beer needs chillin’ and the baby cries
Hearts get shot by Cupid’s arrow
The road to heaven is straight and narrow

Long as there’s sawdust on that old dance floor
And love still hides behind closed doors
Steel guitars keeps on ringin’
Waylon and Willie keep on singin’
If you can swing it, if you can sway it
You can bet we’ll keep on playin’
Long as the wheel in the sky still turns
We are country and western
Country and western

The sundress girls, in the cowboy boots
The Wall Street guy, with that Neil McCoy tattoo
The backroad Buck and Merle traditionalists
Whole lotta love and never been kissed
The storytellers, city dwellers
Four on the floor, with fine wine cellars
Spreadin' those blankets on the lawn
With a bucket of suds singin’

Long as the good lords willin’ and the creek don’t rise
Beer needs chillin’ and the baby cries
Hearts get shot by cupid’s arrow
The road to heaven is straight and narrow

Long as there’s sawdust on that old dance floor
And love still hides behind closed doors
Steel guitars keeps on ringin’
Waylon and Willie keep on singin’
If you can swing it, if you can sway it
You can bet we’ll keep on playin’
Long as the wheel in the sky still turns
We are country and western
We’re all country and western

We’re northern and southern
Sisters and brothers
Motor City down to Mississippi
Vegas lights to Atlantic City, yeah

Long as there’s sawdust on that old dance floor
And love still hides behind closed doors
Steel guitars keeps on ringin’
Waylon and Willie keep on singin’
If you can swing it, if you can sway it
You can bet we’ll keep on playin’
Long as the wheel in the sky still turns
We are country and western

Fiddle and strings in the boombox beat
We’re all country and western
Hip-hop flat tops and flip-flop feet
We’re all country and western
Two lane roads to the city streets
We’re all country and western
Makin’ the bitter, baby, just a little more sweet
We are country and western

I am going to drive on out to the river tonight
Find a quiet spot, turn on my parking lights
I am going to drink some beers, try to catch a buzz
Turn my radio up and forget about us

I am going to lay me down on the hood of this car
Make another wish upon a falling star
I am going to think again about the way it was
I am going to close my eyes and forget about us

I know it would not be easy but I have got a plan
To just let my memory let go of your hand
I am going to miss your touch
But I know I must forget about us

And when the morning sun burns across my face
I will put my shirt back on, get up and walk away
I am going to climb my frame onto a Greyhound bus
Take a little blue pill and forget about us

I know it would not be easy but I have got a plan
To just let my memory let go of your hand
I am going to miss your touch
But I know I must forget about us

By the time I get to Phoenix, I would not know your name
Those soft green eyes, your warm skin
And the way you say "Good morning"
I will be alright

I've run out of clock with a game on the line
I've cried a few tears when I ran out of touch
But I ain't runnin' outta love

I've run out of whiskey to mix with my Coke
I've run out of faith God only knows
I've tried runnin' away and I ran out of road
I've run out of push and I've run out of shove

But I ain't runnin' outta love

I ain't ever leavin' my Hallelujah
Whatever you're preachin'
With everythin' else just breakin' even
You give me more than enough
I ain't runnin' outta love

Got millions of miles on the soles of these boots
My skeleton closets long run out of room
When I'm pushin' empty, just runnin' on fumes
Baby, you always fill me back up

And I ain't runnin' outta love
It ain't gonna happen, never gonna stop

But wherever we go I know we'll still be us

Baby, we ain't got no cares

It's just you and I underneath one of those perfect skies
Don't you think this could be paradise?
Baby, let's roll the dice on love

Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Ooh

Kick off your sandals
Let's light up some candles
This love is a gamble
But baby I play to win
So, let's go all in
Mmh

'Cause what could be better
Than you and me together
So, baby never say never
Just kiss me again and again
My skin against your skin

It's just you and I
Underneath one of those perfect skies
Don't you think this could be paradise?
Baby, let's roll the dice on love

Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice

It's just you and I
Underneath one of those perfect skies
Don't you think this could be paradise
If we roll the dice on love?

Let's take a chance
Let's just fall in to our hands
We don't have to even think to try
Let's roll the dice on love

Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Roll the dice
Come roll the dice
Let's roll the dice
Let's roll the dice on love
Let's roll the dice on love
