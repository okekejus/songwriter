They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?

A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' out your mouth
'Cause I stay winnin', lay 'em up like

Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

Your game is tired
You should retire
You're 'bout as cute as
An old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts

So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' out your mouth
'Cause I stay winnin', lay 'em up like

Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket (Let's go)
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

They know what is what
But they don't know what is what (Katy Perry, what)
They just, know what is what (Young Money)
But they don't know what is what (What)
They just, know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck? (Yo)
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos, no, not Offset
Swish swish, aw, I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aw, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back, I already despise you (Yeah)
All that fake love you showin' couldn't even disguise you
Yo, yo
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror, mirror, who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
The generous queen'll kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be ridin' by
I'ma tell my **** Biggz, yeah, that's the guy
A star's a star, da-ha-da-ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with Queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy

Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket (And another one, and another one)
Can't touch this (Can't touch this)
Another one in the casket (And another one, and another one)

Yeah, y'all know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage

I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy (Enemy)
Your enemy (Your enemy), your enemy

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no goin' back

Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away (Walk away)

It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

So you wanna play with magic?

There's no goin' back

She's a beast, I call her Karma (Come back)
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer (Woo)
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty heart is on steroids 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her (Meet her)
If you get the chance, you better keep her (Keep her)
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer (Freezer)
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleepin' beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair (A fair)
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (You should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?

Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence

Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free

They stumbling and fumbling and we about to riot

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, woah
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away (The one that got away)

The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

"Boom, boom, boom"
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it throu-ou-ough

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah,"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

"Boom, boom, boom"
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Not my intention

Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick

It felt so wrong, it felt so right

Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice

Get ready 'cause I've had enough

My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(And I'll have to get over you all over again)
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(Over you all over again)

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

But this Friday night
Do it all again (Do it all again)
This Friday night
Do it all again (Do it all again)
This Friday night

T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F


Last Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

You make me feel like I'm livin' a (You make me)
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back (No)
My heart stops when you look at me

Always speak cryptically

'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

We kiss, we make up

You're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no

Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh (Used to laugh) 'bout nothing ('Bout nothing)
Now you're plain (Now you're plain) boring (Boring)
I should know (I should know)

Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story

Don't doubt it, don't doubt it

I know it, I know it
(And I will not negotiate)
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

(Oh, ye of so little faith)
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it

You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it

’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole 'nother world

And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all

Every day, Groundhog Day

Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life

Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees (Oh, woah)

But now I got back that smile (C'mon, smile, woo)

You asked the question, I said, "Yes"
But I'm scared

'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"
I do

See us in sixty years with a full family tree (I do)
Give my blood, sweat, and tears to reach our destiny (I do)
'Cause love is a minefield, let's take this war, baby (I do)
'Cause at the end of it all, I choose you and you choose me (I do)

Thank God I was woman enough to come
Answer your father's prayers
You asked the question
I could tell you were scared

'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"

Now let's dance with each other (Dance with each other)
Mixing all of our colors
It's so easy to surrender
When you finally find forever

No, I've never worn white, no
But I really wanna try with you
Yeah, I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"

'Cause I do
Oh, I do, yeah, yeah

Extra sauce on the low (Boo won't know)

A little sushi while I watch a movie
Papaya salad while I sing a ballad
Need some ice cream, make it a swirl

I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf

Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars

You're so skinny, you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly, you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you out of your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup and

I definitely was looking for answers, during that time when I wrote that song, and yeah, I was depressed and sad, and there were thoughts, but there were never actions, thankfully. But I wanted to share that side of my story, because I know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that, and you always feel like you're the only one going through that. You walk out the door, and you see someone you know, and they ask you how you are, and you just have to say you're fine when you're not really fine, but you just can't get into it, because they would never understand. Well, then comes along a song that speaks to you, that makes you feel like "Gosh, I can get through this if she can get through this, I can get through this".

50 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoBy the Grace of God Lyrics“By the Grace of God” is a personal, power ballad about rising above heartbreak and depression, and not letting either of them bring her down.
Was 27, surviving my return of Saturn
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets, locked up tight like Iron Mountain
Running on empty, so out of gas

Thought I wasn’t enough
Found I wasn’t so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn’t take it anymore

By the grace of God (There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
Oh, I can finally see myself again

I know I am enough, possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the universe call the bluff
Yeah, the truth will set you free

By the grace of God (There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out

Oh, that way, no
That way, no
Not in the name of love (In the name of love)
That way, no
That way, no
I am not giving up

By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror (Looked in the mirror)
Looked in the mirror (Looked in the mirror)

By the grace of God (By the grace of God)
(There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (Picked myself back up)
(I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I (In front of the other)
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

I'm uptight
Playing by the rules in this game of life
Three hundred sixty-five days on the grind
Something's stirring, I might need to unwind
Then, there's you
Texting me a little bubble of trouble
I've tried to ignore these thoughts that rumble
I think I'm bored of being so careful

Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go

Like roulette, ooh-oh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-oh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Like roulette (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah, ah-ah-ah)

They say, "Everything in moderation"
And sometimes, you got to give in to temptation
So I drop a pin to my location
Let's roll the dice

Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go

Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Oh, like roulette (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Like roulette (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah, ah-ah-ah)

So tonight, we test limits (Test limits)
Take the safety off for a minute (For a minute)
'Cause my love's a bullet with your name written on it
Just load it and spin it

Like roulette (Ah), ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you (Close my eyes with you)
Like roulette (Oh), ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you (Lose control, lose control)
Like roulette (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah, ah-ah-ah)

In the dark, when you feel lost
Wanna be the best, but at what cost?
If you're gonna stay here
Nothing's ever changin', no
Big world, gotta see it all
Gotta get up even when you fall
There's no point in waitin', no

(Oh) They'll try to bring you down
(Oh) But you've got the power now

I know you feel it (Feel it)
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be

Oh, I can see it, see it
If you believe it, then you can
There's no reason that this life can't be

Long road, got a ways to go
Took a big step, but you're not alone
'Cause we got each other
There's so much you'll discover
Headstrong, but your heart is stronger
Stay calm walkin' through the fire
I know you're gonna make it out

You sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building a life

With every kiss and every letter
Every promise of forever
Oh, but you hit "send"
And disappeared in front of my eyes

And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20, I see through you now

Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind
(I'll be alright) I'll be alright
It doesn't haunt me at night

'Cause every gift and every letter
Every promise of forever
Now is out of sight
Like you were never alive

And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep (My vision's 20/20)
My vision's 20/20, I see through you now

Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
So rest in peace
I'll see you on the other side

And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
(There's an echo) There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly (Oh, and there's just a pillow)
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep

Or how I can be a bitch?
Make you keep your fingers crossed?
Is it the way that I praise you?

Or how fast I change my mind
And get scared that I might leave you?

Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
She’s always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me

Is it the way I cut my hair
And put no makeup on?
I feel most beautiful
Doing what the fuck I want
Is it that my intuition
Is never really off?
I need tissues for my issues
And Band-Aids for my heart

Could spend your whole life, but you couldn’t
Describe what makes a woman
She's always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me

Oh, oh

In a pair of heels?
Yeah, that's what makes a woman

Only love, only love
Only love, only love

Eighty-six thousand, four hundred seconds in a day
I swear lately most of 'em have been a waste
I feel 'em come and go, bury my mistakes
But time just goes on and on in a way

If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, nah, nothing to lose

Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead

Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love

I swear sometimes I hear myself talking, getting mad
Take shit so personal, like it really matters
Oh, am I awake, am I sleepwalking? Tell me that
It's scary how quickly I lose perspective and I react

If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, no, nothing to lose

Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead

Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love (No)
Yeah, give me
Only love, only love
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me (Mmm)
Only love, only love (Only love, only love)
Give me
Only love, only love (Only love, only love, only love)
Only love, only love (Oh, no, only love)
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me (Oh)
And take the love instead

Let me leave this world with the hate behind me

Have you ever lost, lost the light in your life?
Have you ever left, left yourself behind?
Have you ever lied and just replied "I'm fine"?
'Cause I can see you've lost, lost the light in your life

Wanna run like your mascara
Wine-stained lips talkin' to the mirror
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all

Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

If love has left you with, with a question mark
If trust has left you fallin' in nobody's arms

If you wanna hide like your emotions
Heart can't break, it's already broken
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all

Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

Oh, oh

Wanna run like your mascara

[Song 55: Love Me]
33 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoLove Me Lyrics“Love Me” is a song about throwing your insecurities away, because you have to be able to love yourself before you can truly love someone else.
I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn't do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me

But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself the way I wanted you to
Love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume
That I could just unzip and strip
But who I am is who I'm meant to be
And it's who you are in love, in love with

So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They're going to have to take a back seat
I know I have to love myself the way I want you to
Love me

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

No more standing in my own way (Let's go deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way (The way I want you to love me)
No more standing in my own way (Let's go deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way (The way I want you to love me)

No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing my feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

[Song 56: Dance with the Devil]
37 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoDance with the Devil Lyrics
I lost my tug of war today
Took my foot off of the brakes
(The definition of insanity is looping on repeat, and expecting things to change)
But what comes up must hit the ground
So I drink these anvils down
(She always comes to me highly disguised, an angel whispering, so many pretty shapes)

It's a dance with the devil
A stumbling tango
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow

It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance

Just want to connect
But you won't let me do it
So I get altered, (Twisted and conflicted, so I casually can shoot the shit)
Wish less was going on
Wish I could just throw the ball
And ignore it all
(Constantly distracted by the noise of my ping-pong)

It's a dance with the devil
A mercurial wrestle
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow

It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a...
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)

But what, what is it worth
Waking up with a crown of clouds?
What is it worth
When my head spins out with doubt?
Wish I could measure
When the poison is pouring out
Oh...

It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)

Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother

Secretly, I hit the lottery
'Cause you're brighter than all of the Northern Lights

Time is just an invention man has made

I won't act my age
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

So, I recommend that you lose your mind
It was the only thing that was keeping me behind

They say, "Curb your curiosity"
They also say, "Prepare to amend your dreams"
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say

If you didn't know, yeah

Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination

I built a wall so high, no one could reach
A life of locks, I swallowed all the keys
I was petrified, only knew how to hide
They can't hurt me if they don't know me
A full façade made a mirage out of me

Then you came and started digging for a treasure underneath
And you found a better version of me I had never seen

Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?

I was a ship floating aimlessly
So camouflaged, was my own worst enemy

Then you came in like a sailor with a heart that anchored me
And every day, I wake up grateful I'm no longer lost at sea

Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?

Oh, 'cause no one's ever seen me like this
Seen right through the bullshit
I pray that I can keep unfolding
Pray that I can just stay open
Just stay open, just stay open, just stay open

Oh, 'cause you broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open, and now I'm ready
This is intimacy

Catchin' up with folks we barely know
Sure, it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season

Our love is something priceless

I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

Take the day off (Take the day off)
Get a massage (Get a massage)

I'm losing all direction
Slipping into quicksand
I've shattered the illusion
Seen behind the curtain
I'm disenchanted
Dancing on a wire
Juggling desire
Every hit gets harder
When you're fighting without armor
I'm disheartened

Do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way

I used to be so sparkling
But now it's not so charming
What used to stimulate me
Now can barely wake me
I'm unresponsive
Will I find salvation?
Some kind of moderation?
Spinning all these plates is
Gonna be a challenge
A delicate balance

So do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way

Get out of my own way

Get out of my own way

Some call it science (Science), we call it chemistry

Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet

I've flown a million miles, just to find a magic seed
A white flower with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, get my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack
You keep me alive and keep me coming back
I see the sun rise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies

Spread my wings and make me fly

Who am I living for?

I can feel this light that's inside of me
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning
I know one spark will shock the world
Yeah yeah
So I pray for favor like Esther
I need your strength to handle the pressure
I know there will be sacrifice
But that's the price

It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
And I can see the heavens, but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name

I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Oh, oh, yeah

I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?

At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?

[Song 76: This Moment]
33 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoThis Moment Lyrics“This Moment” is a 80’s-throwback anthem about taking one’s time to enjoy today. Katy wrote the song after being inspired by Eckhart Tolle’s book “The Power of Now”.
Can you tell me, who called a race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time?
But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can’t push rewind

All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

Do you ever think that, we're just chasing our tails?
Like life is one big fast treadmill
And we pop what is prescribed
If it gets us first prize
But you know who I, who I think will win
Are the ones that let love in
Are the ones that take the time

All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?

Be here with me now
Be here with me now
'Cause the future is right now, right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now, I'm in front of you
Baby, don't blink and miss this moment

Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me, yeah?
Be here with me now

Too many vices, I hear the voices, sirens then silence
It's gettin' closer, I'm closin' my eyelids
And when it's over, my head to the sky
And I realize everybody wears a disguise

You are my hurt locker lover
Keep me walking on a wire
Don't know when you'll blow
So I tiptoe through your triggered mind
You fight me, but I'm on your side
Defeated, now retreating

Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing

Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore

I've tried to pick off your red flags
While dancing on broken glass
Your mind games hit like grenades
Feel cursed, just like the Kennedys
But you somehow get me on my knees
Defeated, now retreating

Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing

Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
No, I am not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
I don't wanna fight no more, anyway, anyway

Lay me down at your altar, baby

Your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues
I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose

Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float

Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a Nirvana finally

Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float

You make me float

This is spiritual, under your spell
So phenomenal, the way you make me feel

I leave the gas on, walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning, I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and running all the red lights
Did I get your attention? 'Cause I'm sending all the signs that
The clock is ticking and I'll be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black, you'd best prepare a speech
Say something funny, say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me

I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship, oh

Maybe I was too pale, maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better, better luck in the sack
No formal education, I swore way too much
I swear you didn't care 'cause we were in love
So as I write this letter and shed my last tear, know
It's all for the better that we end this here
Let's close this chapter, say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me

I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Oh, we've been diagnosed
So let's give up the ghost
'Cause I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip

Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high, but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends
Oh, oh, oh

Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down, oh
My mother says I should come back home, but
Can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
So if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?

Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?

Is there a light, is there a light
At the end of the road?
I'm pushing everyone away
'Cause I can't feel this anymore
Feel this anymore

Have you ever been so lost?
Know the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost? (Been so lost)

More than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets

Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight

Gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me

Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather than end up begging on the streets
Trading under-table favors for a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more than this
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin

I wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight

I've never been clearer, I'm at peace with moving on
I'm seeing it different now that I'm outside of the storm
I'm feeling the distance, it's always dark before the dawn

I wanna know the truth
Even if it hurt-hurts me (Hurts me, hurts me)
I wanna know the truth
Even if it hurt-hurts me (Hurts me, hurts me)
Show me the fire, show me flames
Don't try to hide it, spare me the pain (Spare me the pain)
I wanna know the truth
Even if it hurt-hurts me (Hurts me, hurts me)

The person you're trying to reach is unavailable
Hey babe, where are you?
I can't get a hold of you
We really should talk
Where are you?

1 ContributorDid Somebody Say (Menulog) Lyrics
Did somebody say Menulog?
Ding-dong, ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong
Did somebody say Menulog?

Want my curry in a hurry (Medium spice)
Extra sauce on the low (Boo won't know)
And I want açai
Yeah, yeah, yeah, when I'm ordering delivery

A little sushi while I watch a movie
Papaya salad while I sing a ballad
Need some ice cream, make it a swirl
Gotta treat this California girl

When you’re running low there's only one place to go
'Cause I get what I want, when I want it (When I want it)
Margherita with extra cheese on it
Download, now all I gotta do is pull out my phone
Easy: One, two, three
Mocha-whip triple-shot, it means a latte to me

Back from the club (Sandwich)
Eating subs in the tub (Famished)
Spicy chicken when I’m ready
Bon Appétit from me, Katy Perry

34 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoČeskyPortuguêsMannequin Lyrics“Mannequin” is a song about a boy who Katy doesn’t understand. She doesn’t consider him to be a man, but just a mannequin who isn’t capable of loving her like she loves him.
How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?
Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down a man is no workout
But I have no clue how to get through to you

Oh
I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knockin' on wood
Hopin' there's a real boy inside

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in, make you talk
Even pull a string for you to say anything
But with you, there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts and I can't seem to find your heart

Oh
I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool
This one's out of my hands
I can't put you back together again

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
You're just a, a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand?
But you're not a man

If the past is the problem, our future could solve 'em, baby
I could bring you to life if you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt, but in the end
You'll be a man

You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
A toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy?
Understand
But you're not a man
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

Pick a part, you dream it up
A dark vixen, a Lolita
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy

Push, pull, pressure, pleasing

Breathing deep, gaining speed, 'bout to peak
Trembling, trembling, trembling

Got drunk at Joe's, crashed our bicycles
You even met my mama

She saw that look in your eyes (Oh, no, no)

If you want me, the cherry on top

If you want me, you better do better than that tonight (Oh-oh)
If you want me, it takes more than a wink
More than a drink, more than you think
If you want me, you're gonna have to break the bank tonight (Ooh)

'Cause some don't have the patience
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill

'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass
A one-night stand, a storage shed
I think you better walk by tonight (Oh no)
If you want me, then stop begging
I don't put out for charity
If you want me, there's no discount price tonight (Ooh)

But I don't need your dollar bills
I just want something real
'Cause nothing's free
Except loving me

If you wanna ride, just name your price
Don't play cheap with your heart

[Song 97: The One That Got Away (Acoustic)]
17 ContributorsThe One That Got Away (Acoustic) Lyrics
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

The one (The one), the one (The one)
Oh, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should have told you what you meant to me, whoa, whoa, oh
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away, oh, oh whoa
The one

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

Remember when
I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee?
Under my skin
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories

Every bone's been broken
But my heart is still wide open

I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

With each scar, there's
A map that tells a story
What a souvenir of
Young love's like
Jumping out an airplane
Riding a tidal wave of

An ocean of emotion (Of emotion)
My heart rips me wide open

I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

And I'd cover up these scars
But no make up can make up what we break up
And I can't stop seeing stars
I'm so knocked out whenever you're around-ound, around

I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Oh, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to, oh

No, I can't stop
Oh, I can't stop, no, I can't stop
And I'm going out in flames
Oh, I'm going down in flames

Baby, you are the weapon I choose

I take these turns a bit too fast
Trying to leave you in my past
The CD skips our favorite songs
Our greatest hits just don't belong
I really love to hate this
Love, hate, hate-love

Relationships are overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over and I could go for
Another chance to do this over again

So this is it? After all we've been through
We called it quits and now I'm about to
I've lost my grip or what little I had left
You said it's over and I could really go for
A cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me, you'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose

I pop these pills like Cracker Jacks
And the prize, the glazed eyes just watching you react
When you're depressed, you sleep too much
I'm not sure if I'm waking up

It's overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over and I could go for
Another chance to do this over again

So this is it? After all we've been through
We called it quits and now I'm about to
I lost my grip or the little I had left
You said it's over and I could really go for
A cup of coffee and an overdose

Leave it all behind me, you'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close

Oh

I, I-I-I, I, I stood in line
I stood in line without you
And I don't tell you
All they ever thought (I stood in line without you)
About you (I stood in line without you)
Well, without you (I stood in line without you)
Is everything I've got

I stood in line without you
And I don't tell you

You wanna wet your whistle, come and have a drink (Ice cold)
Cool as a cucumber, you're coming on to me
You say, "You got the ripest melons on the street"
My honeydew and your banana make a treat

'Cause baby, don't you know all the boys are jelly of you?
But first comes, first serve
Don't you know that it's so delicious, yummy and new
But first comes, first serves, so bottoms up!

You'll have to count your calories when you're with me
Because my sugar gonna give you cavities
Don't wanna share me 'cause I'm such a tasty treat (Yum, yum)
I'll let you double dip it in your favorite sauce
I'll even let you eat the cherry on the top
You'll beg for seconds in a diabetic shock (What?)

One sip, you'll be salivating

You're such a poet
I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey, sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You dont even need a rhyming dictionary
I wipe my hands on your jeans, 'cause they are more distressed
So they say you got O.C.D
And they claim you can barely read
But you say, "Don't bother me with all of your reality"

But it could be so simple (You're overthinking)
Life should be that simple (Who would have thought it?)
I wish it were just so simple (You're overthinking)
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems?

So what, you're a genius?
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
'Cause you bought too much Vuitton
You park (Park) in a loading zone
You sleep (Sleep) with the lights all on
You cross your 'i's and dot your 't's
All it goes to show

Life should be that simple (Who would have thought it?)
I wish it were just that simple (You're overthinking)
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems?

I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake
Just take a moment to evaluate
The possibilities
The situations
The opportunities
That are waiting
Oh, the possibilities
Oh, I

It could, it could be that simple (You're overthinking)
Life should be that simple (Who would have thought it?)
I wish it were just so simple (You're overthinking)
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems?

We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh-oh, is that I need you listen, please
And focus on, on life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
'Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems

It is all so simple
Just deal with it

On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
Can anybody see? Is anybody waving back at me?
(Back at me, back at me)

Is anybody waving? (Is anybody waving?)
Waving, waving, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Song 105: HAS A HEART]
9 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolPolskiHAS A HEART Lyrics
I want kindness

Sometimes it can be a neighbor
It can be a stranger
Doesn't matter who you are
If we all give a little kindness
Something to remind us
Everybody has a heart

When life's a bummer
And suddenly the rug gets pulled from under
Feels like the cloud is gonna last forever
But then you show up with a loving gesture
And make it better

If you're going through something
Reach out, hug someone
Tell 'em you love 'em (Hey, hey, hey)
If you're going through something
Reach out, call someone
Tell 'em you love 'em (Hey, hey, hey)

Sometimes it can be a neighbor
It can be a stranger
Doesn't matter who you are
If we all give a little kindness
Something to remind us
Everybody has a heart

Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, oh
Everybody has a heart
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, oh, oh
Everybody has a heart (Yeah)

We're all so different
But I think we can all agree on one thing
Love is the answer to all of our questions
So when you hear this song, pass on the message
We're all connected

If you're going through something
Reach out, hug someone
Tell 'em you love 'em (Hey, hey, hey)
If you're going through something
Reach out, call someone
Tell 'em you love 'em (Hey, hey, hey)

Sometimes it can be a neighbor
It can be a stranger
Doesn't matter who you are
If we all give a little kindness
Something to remind us
Everybody has a heart

Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, oh
(Everybody) Everybody has a heart
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, oh
(Everybody) Everybody has a heart

I love you

Katy Perry:
Super Bowl are you ready to roar?
COME ON!
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down but I got up (Hey!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake your ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am the champion, and you're gonna hear me roar (Roar louder)
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me—
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy (Your enemy)
Your enemy (Your enemy), your enemy

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (You should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this? (Oh-oh)
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse (Like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (Ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (A perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine (Mine)
There's no goin' back
There's no goin' back
There's no goin' back
Ladies and gentelmen, Lenny Kravitz!

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine
You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Make some noise Super Bowl)
(Crowd applause)

I know a place, sing it!
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Missy be puttin' it down, I'm the hottest 'round
I told y'all, y'all can't stop me now
Listen to me now, I'm lastin' twenty rounds
And if you want me  then come on, get me now
Is you with me now? Then biggie, biggie bounce
I know you dig the way I sw-sw-switch my style
Holla
People sing around
Now people gather 'round, now people jump around
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on
Go, getcha getcha getcha getcha getcha freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on
Is it worth it? Let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup (lets go Super Bowl)
If you got a big *elephant trumpet*, let me search ya
And find out how hard I gotta work ya
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup

Music make you lose control
I got a cute face, chubby waist
Thick legs, in shape
Rump shakin, both ways
Make you do a double take
Planet rocker, show stopper
Flow proper, head knocker
Beat scholar, tail dropper
Do my thang
Just throw your hands in the air!
Just throw your hands in the air!
Just throw your hands in the air!
Music make you lose control

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Oh, yeah, yeah! Thank you and God bless America!

I'm used to opening my own doors and splittin' the checks
He introduced me, was always just the friend
I bought a new dress, he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman

Oh, love
I think I'm ready, ready for it

You were such a surprise, an unexpected gift
Said I was pretty and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you and this is just a phase
Could I get used to being loved the right way?
I wanna argue, but there is nothing to say

Oh, love
I think I'm ready, ready for it (Ready for it)
Oh, love
I think I'm ready

'Cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
Yeah, we talk for hours, you still wanna listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight

My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
So scared to feel this way

But love

Lightning strikes only once in your life
I guess I'm lucky 'cause I've found myself
In the line of fire tonight
My heart beats like thunder under my skin
And my world speaks in wonder since you appeared
Now we are here

And I could die in your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame

Dreams hardly ever do come true
I guess I'm lucky 'cause I've found myself
Waking up right next to you
Oh, and with this raging heart of mine
I'll love you till the end of time
I thank the gods that our stars align
From the ocean floor to the distant sun
Forever more to kingdom come
Have no fear, I'll be burning here

And I could die (I could die)
In your arms tonight
But it would be a shame (A shame)
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame (Your immortal)
I'll be your (Your immortal)
Ooh, I'll be your (Your immortal)
Oh, I'll be your (Your immortal flame)

And I could die in your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame

Love you again and again
An everlasting fantasy
I'll be your immortal

But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test

But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)

Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile

Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life

Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees (Oh, woah)
A Mona Lisa masterpiece

Yeah, I'm thankful

[Song 117: The Box]
10 ContributorsThe Box Lyrics
I was living in a small mind
With no lifeline
And no messages can reach me from the outside
When I looked out over the horizon
Didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising

Then it hit me
Maybe bit me
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me
I didn't know exactly where I would be going
But I had to let this river in me flowing

What a ride
When you open your eyes
For the very first time
A real surprise

I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water, every moment I'm alive

I was living on a fault line
The fault was all mine
And this unstable ground found me down half the time
But I had enough
I had to get up
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff

Then it hit me
You won't permit me
To be an individual
Just doesn't fit me
But I decided that it's going to be living
Yeah, I decided I'm escaping from your prison

What a high
When you open your mind for the very first time
A real surprise

I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water, every moment I'm alive

So long conformity
And ambiguity is a new priority
All it takes, for heaven sakes
Is to figure out the face and learn to separate

I started living outside of the box
Taking my time when I always used to rush
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I broke down the walls for my liberation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive

Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside
Ha ha ha
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation

Oh, living outside of the box
Of the box, of your life
Of everything that seems nice
Oh, living outside of the box

[Song 118: Message from Katy Perry]
16 ContributorsMessage from Katy Perry LyricsHello to everybody listening to Smile, it's Katy Perry.
I wanna say a very special hello to all of my incredible, beautiful, loyal, encouraging KatyCats all around the world.
Thank you so much for being on this journey with me every single time I put out a record, and for being excited and letting the music, um... work its magic on you, and for showing up at the shows, and all the little places, and for being such an incredible team and a support system that I can always rely on.
I am so incredibly grateful for each and every one of you, and the things that you make online, that make me laugh, and the care that you show, and... all of it, I am so profoundly grateful.
And that's what a lot of this record is: it's, it's a... a record that I never really set out to make, but here we are. You know, after continuing my writing process for 2 years, I would get a little message and just be a vessel for, um... different songs or ideas over the past 2 years, and we had many of them so we felt like, maybe it should be a record. Maybe the record should be called "Smile", and it should be about finding your smile once again.
Um... I don't know about any of you, but sometimes I can feel super low, and alone, and really in my head, and be my own worst enemy, and let that horrible negative voice that trickle, trickles in and out of my, of my head, take over. And, in this past couple of years I've really, um, tried to work on that; and I think a lot of these songs reflect walking through that process, walking through that valley, and coming out the other end alive, and giving live, and, um...
So, I just, I'm so grateful you guys are listening, I, um... I'm excited, I wanna know what your favorite songs are. I have one more song that you're about to hear, um, this song is kind of a funny, sassy song. Definitely don't @ me when you hear it, but thank you once again for listening to all the songs. I hope these songs are encouraging and can lift you out of whatever you're feeling, or give you a little umpfh, or, um... give you whatever you need for today. And if you lost your smile, it helps you find your smile again.
God bless you! I love you.

Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
Yeah

The one
Uh-huh
Baby, you're a
California girl
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
You

I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)

In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

But this Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
They say, "Be afraid"
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

"Boom, boom, boom"
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
"Boom, boom, boom"
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in period one
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
Yeah, I saw you talking to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen

I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

I used to work at the record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off the hardwood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in L.A.
That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days

And I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah


(Ooh, ah, hey)
I will wait for you

And if you ever get back to Hackensack

I can't let go of control
I can't let go and not know
Don't know the way ahead of me
One day at a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
That I could hand over the keys

I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map

So let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I've jumped and I got no regret
You're my co-pilot, yeah that’s right
Now I can just enjoy the ride

I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map (life is beautiful)
Without a map, without a map, without a map (life is beautiful, life is beautiful, life is beautiful)

I know we're finally falling
Cause I was giving you half no more than
My hand's in the air while you're driving
This is living, this is living, this is living
Oh it's beautiful, beautiful
Being with you, being with you

I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map (life is beautiful, life is beautiful, life is beautiful)
Without a map, without a map, without a map (life is beautiful, life is beautiful, life is beautiful)

The weight of my words
Are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves, but you won't hear a thing
'Cause I've dug myself deep
I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach

In one ear and out your other
So lock and key
You won't open up for me

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us

And it feels like you're in China
And I am in Peru
Whenever I am sleeping next to you, oh
We can hear the crickets singing
Oh, all throughout the night
Oh, boy, can't you just get used to something so right?

And sure, I confess
I'm a mess, I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten before you go and throw it all away

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us

'Cause if you give up
Then what am I supposed to do?
All of our dreams never will come true without you

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving up
I'm not giving, giving up

Oh, baby
Don't give up on this love

Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Oh, boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Oh, boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
I'll love you for, I'll love you for life
Lifetimes
I know you feel it
Can you believe it?
I'm gonna love you 'til the end and then repeat it
I know you feel it
Can you believe it?
I'm gonna love you 'til the end and then repeat it

I know you know my boyfriend is out of town
So have a drink, let's talk it over
So many things I shouldn't be saying now
You know, I like my boys a little bit older

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

All my girls are nowhere to be found
They all split when I'm in trouble
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around
The undercover lovers under the covers

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I just wanna use your lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove
I just wanna use your lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove
I just wanna use your lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove, lo-o-o-o-ove

Trying to stop my head from spinning
Too much to drink, not making sense
It's been a while since I've been with someone new
That I can't stop the way I'm feeling

As you leave, please, would you just close the door?
Now that our love affair is over
You're exactly what I was looking for
We'll find a shoulder to cry upon

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love
(Oh, I just wanna use your love, baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love
(Oh, I just wanna use your love, baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
I just wanna use your love
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

I don't wanna lose your love tonight

Ah-ah-ah

I felt it, the wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter, I never saw it coming
I started to black out and then someone said good mornin'
I took it as a warning, I should've seen it coming
So now I'll take a chance on this thing we may have started
Intentional or not I don't think we saw it coming
It's all addin' up to something
That as for some involvement, that as for a commitment
I think I see it comin' if we stepped out on that limb

My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I've got
So take a long shot

I realize that there is all this doubting
Things we're both scared about that
We'll never see 'em coming, throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing into this fully knowing
We'll never see it coming 'til it's much too close to stop

My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause I'm the best you've got
So take a long shot

Oh, I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming, but we'll make it even though

It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take a long shot

You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw me coming
You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw this coming
I take the long shot
I take the long shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
'Cause you're the best I've got
Oh, I'm taking this chance on you, baby
I'm taking this chance on you, baby

I've got people to see
Places to go
Deadlines to meet
A reputation to up hold
It's like a ton of bricks
Breaking on my back
It’s like
The force of gravity
In full effect

I got money to burn
And I'm on the sake
They bet their bomb on me
Cause I'm their ace of spades
I feel the walls
Getting closer
I'm like a bomb
With all red wires

All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
I'm gonna be

A diamond
It won't ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends a diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for

If not for the push
I’d probably be a pebble
If not for the pressure
I’d be forgotten forever
Just another stone
Skipped upon the water
Drowning fast before
The other failures

I don't wanna be
A distant memory
On your wall
Just another cd
That you burned
And never bought
Am I not worth it to you?
After all that drama
That we've been though?

All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
I'm gonna be

A diamond
It won't ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends
A diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for

Ooh ooh  diamond
I've gotta be a diamond
(I'm a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if I fall)
Oh  oh  oh
Yeah yeah yeah

All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
I'm gonna be

I'm a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if I fall
Into the arms of a coma

All this pressure
I've got pressure
I'm gonna be a diamond baby
I've gotta be a diamond
Your gonna see
I'm gonna be a diamond

[Song 129: Rock God]
11 ContributorsRock God Lyrics“Rock God” is a song originally meant for Perry’s unreleased album, (A) Katy Perry. Selena Gomez & the Scene then recorded the song for their sophomore album, A Year Without Rain.
Preacher man walked into the bar and he said
He said "Hey girl, can't you walk a mile straight?"
Father, I'm torn and I'm selling my soul
To the rhythm, the beat and the bass

'Cause I can't confess my rock and roll ways
'Cause I'm so possessed with the music, the music he plays

I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god

Preacher man took my hand and looked in my eyes
He said "Hey girl, can't you live your life right?"
Father, things aren't always so black and white
Don't cast the first stone 'cause I'm not alone

And it's not like I'm hurting anyone
But I can't confess my rock, my rock and roll ways

I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god

No, I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
I chose a path and I'm not looking back
And I'm sorry if I left the angels cryin' over me

I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god

Preacher man, preacher man, oh
Preacher man, preacher man, oh
Preacher man, preacher man, oh
Preacher man, preacher man, oh

'Cause I'm gone, gone, gone (Oh, oh)
Gone, gone, gone
Yeah, I'm gone, gone, gone (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Song 130: Freedom (Spirit)]
3 ContributorsFreedom (Spirit) Lyrics
Look at those beautiful eyes
She reminds me so much of me
Starting out in a brand new world
Who she gonna be?
Will she follow everything that's been said?
Maybe listen to her heart instead
Maybe she needs to be free
She got that from me

What you get is what you see
It's a fantasy life, but it's real to me
And I'll do what I want when I want to do it
I didn't want to live in a box or mansion fault with doors and locks so I never let anyone put me through it

Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Do it all for you

They all talk, talk, talking at me
Telling me who I am, what to do with my body
And I'll do what I want when I want to do it
Grandma, soon I'll see you too when I overdose, tripping on my shoes
Be the next Queen of Pop

Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Do it all for you

(Instrumental chimes and hymns)
Give it up to you
Do it all for you

Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Do it all for you

Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
Can't you see?
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
That's all I want from me

Of anything, and everything

You know there's a method
There's a method to my madness
You just need to trust it
Please just trust the process

But you're short-sighted
So narrow-minded
You don't know it all
I've got the greatness
Flesh full of aces
And I know something you don't

There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
You break me off but I've become higher than helium
An antidote you slippin' on, so sip on
'Cause there's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness

I know where I'm headed
Just watch me manifest it
You see it all in hindsight
Hope you don't miss the message

Don't be short-sighted
So narrow-minded
You don't know it all
No, you can't fake this
It's not contagious
And I know something you don't

There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
You break me off but I've become higher than helium
An antidote you slippin' on, so sip on

To my, to my, to my madness

Boy, you think this is easy
Then you should try your way (Ah)
I make this look easy
Rome wasn't built in a day
Hear me when I say

There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
You break me off but I've become higher than helium
An antidote you slippin' on, so sip on

I saw you at the grocery store
Oh you both looked happy
Picking out the usual
She's a carbon copy
Of everything you lost, of everything I'm not
I guess you just forgot how to pick 'em

If she's the one I've heard about
I'm disappointed
If she's the reason why you left
I'm not impressed at all
Well this looks like the end
Yeah, I hope we can still be friends
Congratulations

Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again

And again
And again
And again

Well, someone had to tell the truth
And I'm always honest
I read you like an open book
And it's obvious to me
She's just the one between, heading no where fast
Sure it's gonna last forever

Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again
Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again

And again
And again
And again
Oh, you wish
You wish

9 ContributorsDaisies (Can’t Cancel Pride) Lyrics
Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
(I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock, your peacock)
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air)
(Air) Tonight (Tonight) I'm walking on air (I'm walking)
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (Air)
Tonight (Tonight) I'm walking on air (I'm walking on air)
Another one in the basket (Air)
(Basket) Tonight (Tonight) I'm walking on air (I'm walking) Can't touch this
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (Another one in the casket) Air (Casket)
Tonight (Tonight) I'm walking on air

Let's go!
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the ----?

They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out (Count me out)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

You know it's crazy 'cause
Nights like this would start out with a little private party
You sneak me in your mom's house
I know I mighta spilled my drink, but
Really wasn't tryna spill my heart out
I mean, it started as a conversation
I was really tryna get my thoughts out
But then we make moves and we make plans
Had the whole thing mapped out
See, you were gonna go to college
And to pay for bills, I'd figure a job out
And you knew I had to say it, but them day's gone
Now I moved on and you switched phones
Hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

I'm falling for you like dominoes
From the top of the hundredth floor
Look out below, Geronimo
Tryna get behind the closed doors to your soul
Why'd you have to end the show?
We had such a beautiful plot
There was still more story to go
Now look, I'm not insinuating that
You're some type of fair weather player
But even if the whole world falls over
I wouldn't be aware of a glacier
I just wanna see you wake up
Doin' your hair in the mirror with your makeup
Then, maybe the next lifetime, we could make up

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away (The one that got away)

The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
In another life

Let's skip the foreplay
We know were gonna do it anyway
Cause all I'm selling is...

Sex, sex

Sex, sex

Have you seen my video?
Look at me I'm dancing in slow-mo
And the ad campaign I'm bathing in champagne
Cause I'm a lady
Good for one thing maybe
And all I'm selling is...

Will you be my sugar daddy if I promise to behave?
Then you can have me, but you'll be digging your own grave
Oh, it's not worth it, I've already done my circuit
All I'm selling is, all I'm giving is, all I'm selling is...

Oh Lord, I'm so tired
Oh, oh

Hold me
Me, me

[Song 145: Psycho Love]
8 ContributorsPsycho Love Lyrics
Twelve noon
Watch her sleeping in your room
Why can't that still be me?
Two o'clock and I'm still driving 'round your block
Feeling a little crazy

You'd change your number and move to the suburbs
You run, but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising
That look on your face

I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever

So weeks pass and I found myself another catch
Someone who loves me equally, yeah
The tables turn and you're not happy
When you learn he's moving in with me

He bought me a big ring, we moved to the city
Now you won't stop calling
'Cause you always thought that you'd have your plan B
Now you're showing
Up at my place
Not surprising
We both play this game

You're underneath my street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
You're right outside my window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever

La la la la
La la la la
Forever
La la la la
La la la la

You'd change your number and move to the suburbs
You run, but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising
That look on your face

I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever
I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love

Every week's the same
Stuck in school's so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Getting up at 8AM's crazy
Tired of being told what to do
So unfair, so uncool

The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
(Time when we're gonna)

Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good to let go, oh-oh (Go, oh-oh)

Hanging out's just something we like to do
My friends and the mess we get into
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use

The day's too long
Yeah, I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
(Time when we're gonna)

Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good to let go, oh-oh (Go, oh-oh)

Wish it would never end
Spending time with my friends
Oh, with my friends!

Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good to let go
Breakout

Dressed like an Indian prince baby
You lookin fine and so mighty
Hot cold can I take a bit baby
Be your first fruit burst lady

So take it slow
Move my boat

Take it to the next level
If you want another medal

Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it

Slow motion, sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys oh, yes they will
They don't want to define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills, then get cold feet

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

I can't cook, no but I can clean
Up the mess you left
Lay your head down
And feel the beat as I kiss

Your forehead, this may not last
But this is now
So love the one you're with
You wanna chase
But you're chasing your tail
Quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with a snap of your fingers
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
'Cause you don't
Wanna miss out

10 ContributorsGirl Next Door Lyrics“Girl Next Door” is an unreleased song from Katy Perry. The song was given to Jessie James Decker for her  self-titled album.
Got a call from my friend
She saw my picture again
In a magazine
We laughed out loud
'Cause she said, "Remember when this was all a silly dream?"
Now I wake up every day
In a different city
A smile on my face
Somebody pinch me
She said "All the world's a stage"
But girl you know
Those cameras and lights
Won't ever change me

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

It's amazin' to hear people singin' along
Hear the radio playin' my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside
In the spotlight

Now every now and then
On a Friday night, cruisin' down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend saturday sleepin' in late
Yeah, those were the good days

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

And even when I'm miles away
I'll always have the roots from where I came
'Cause when it all fades away
My home will still be the same
Ooh

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch

7 ContributorsFaith Won’t Fail Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

You could throw me in the fire
And I won't be burned
For my faith is Your desire
And Your, Your love endures
You could throw me in the prison cell
Shackle me up against the rail
But time and time again
My faith won't fail

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He will, He'll pick me up
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Oh, time and time again
My faith won't fail

You could cast me in the lion's den
But they won't harm me
For Your grace surrounds me
And it sets me free
And I can walk upon the water
And I will not drown
For my eyes are set upon You
And no one can bring me down

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He will, He'll pick me up
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail

For His angels surround me
And You've poured out this blood covering, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I will walk and not fail, oh
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He will, He'll pick me up
For time and time again
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He will, He'll pick me up
For time and time again
