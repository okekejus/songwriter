I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist

That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve—just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
’Cause heaven forbid it should fall outta place

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt

The car won't start, it's falling apart
I was late for work and the boss got smart
My pantyline shows, got a run in my hose
My hair went flat, man, I hate that (Hate that)
Oh, just when I thought things couldn't get worse
I realized I forgot my purse
With all this stress, I must confess
This could be worse than PMS
This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait until the end of the day
Hey honey, I'm on my way
Hey (Hey)
Hey (Hey)
Hey
Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Rub my feet, give me something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my neck's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone, give the dog a bone
Hey (Hey)
Hey
Honey, I'm home

I broke a nail opening the mail
I cursed out loud 'cause it hurt like hell
This job's a pain; it's so mundane
It sure don't stimulate my brain

This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait until the end of the day
Hey honey, I'm on my way
Hey (Hey)

Get off the phone, give the dog a bone

Oh, rub my neck, will you?
Yeah, woo
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Rub my feet, give me something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat

This is what a woman wants

Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, he still better love me
And I can be late for a date—that's fine
But he'd better be on time
Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!"

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

Well, any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's looking better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He'd better say, "Mmm, I like it like that, yeah"

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!"

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

Let me hear you say
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!"

(Any man, any man, any man)
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

You gotta shimmy shake
Make the earth quake
Kick, turn, stomp, stomp, then you jump
Heel to toe, do-si-do
'Til your boots wanna break
'Til your feet and your back ache
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
Come on everybody on the floor
A-one two, a-three four
Hup two, hup
If you wanna be a man of mine, that's right
This is what a woman wants

Lyrically, the song is about money can often sometimes be wasted on materialistic things.
Mm, oh

We live in a greedy little world
That teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly
Then turn around and spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money that we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So we're shoppin' every Sunday at the mall

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

(Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching! (Ka-ching!)
Lots of diamond rings (Ka-ching!)
The happiness it brings (Ka-ching!)
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

When you're broke, go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when you get bored

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

(Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching! (Ka-ching!)
Lots of diamond rings (Ka-ching!)
The happiness it brings (Ka-ching!)
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things
Let's swing

Dig deeper in your pocket
Ooh, yeah, ah
Come on, I know you've got it
Dig deeper in your wallet
Whoa

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

(Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching! (Ka-ching!)
Lots of diamond rings (Ka-ching!)
The happiness it brings (Ka-ching!)
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things (Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

I left my heart at a waterin' hole
Somewhere in small-town Ohio
Headed out west to Arizona
'Cause the east coast weather's too cold, cold, cold
Easy come, easy go
I got a fast car with the '90s on
Not a soul on the road, but the road is home

Smiles for miles
All up on my face (My face)
Wear it, share it
'Cause we ain't got time to waste (Get to it)

Up in your giddy up, giddy, giddy up
Up in your giddy up
Drunk in the city, got litty in the cup
Up in your giddy up
When it gets tough, gotta get a little love
Put some up in your giddy, giddy up

Time to make it happеn 'cause it feels so good
Singin' in the mirror like it's Hollywood
Lifе is gettin' shorter, gotta drink it up
Time to shine like I know you should
Slide to the left, then slide to the right
Jump in the air 'til you're ten feet high, yeah
Come on, come on and make it your night

Smiles for miles
All up on my face (My face)
Wear it, share it
'Cause we ain't got time to waste (Get to it)

Up in your giddy up
Drunk in the city, got litty in the cup
Up in your giddy up
When it gets tough, gotta get a little love
Put some up in your giddy, giddy up

[Song 17: Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?]
16 ContributorsWhose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under? Lyrics“Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?” is a song by Shania Twain, released as the lead single from her second studio album, The Woman in Me. Lyrically, the song is primarily about a man cheating.
Whose bed have your boots been under?
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
But whose bed have your boots been under?

Don't look so lonely
Don't act so blue
I know I'm not the only
Girl you run to
I know about Lolita
Your little Spanish flame
I've seen you around with Rita
The redhead down the lane

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

I heard you've been sneaking
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill
And I've seen you walking
With long-legs Louise
And you weren't just talking
Last night with Denise

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

Come on, boots
Oh yeah (Come on)
So next time you're lonely
Don't call on me
Try the operator
Maybe she'll be free

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder?
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

I wanna know whose bed, baby
Whoa baby
Tell me
Whose bed
Yes, I wanna know
You better start talking
Or you better start walking

[Song 18: No One Needs to Know]
10 ContributorsNo One Needs to Know Lyrics
Am I dreaming or stupid?
I think I've been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
I met a tall, dark and handsome man
And I've been busy making big plans
But no one needs to know right now
I got my heart set, my feet wet
But he don't even know it yet
And no one needs to know right now

I'll tell him someday, some way, somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

I want bells to ring, a choir to sing
The white dress, the guests, the cake, the car, the whole darn thing
But no one needs to know right now

I'll tell him someday, some way, somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

We'll have a little girl, a little boy
A little Benji we call Leroy
But no one needs to know right now

And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only, only he can make it right
And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only, only he can make it right

I'm not dreaming or stupid
But boy, have I been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now

There's your record Hoggs
Yup, there you go dudes

You've got a way with me
Somehow you got me to believe
In everything that I could be
I've gotta say, you really got a way
You've got a way it seems
You gave me faith to find my dreams
You'll never know just what that means
Can't you see?
You've got a way with me

It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

You've got a way with words
You get me smiling even when it hurts
There's no way to measure what your love is worth
I can't believe the way you get through to me

It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

Oh, how I adore you
Like no one before you
I love you just the way you are

It's in the way you want me
Oh, it's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

It's just the way you are

16 ContributorsDon’t Be Stupid (You Know I Love You) Lyrics
Cool
Yeah
Uh-uh, yeah

You're so complicated
You hang over my shoulder when I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys, you think they're on my tail
I get so aggravated
When I get off the phone and get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me?
And you'll see

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax

Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible

I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (Can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
Don't be stupid, you know I love you

Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax, Max

Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible
No, no, no

I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (Can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you

Don't be stupid
My baby

I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (Can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you

Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible, impossible
Oh, no, no, no

Don't be, don't be, don't be, baby

[Song 21: When]
11 ContributorsWhen Lyrics
One, two, now
Yeah!

If elephants could fly. I'd be a little more optimistic
But I don't see that happening anytime soon
I don't mean to sound so pessimistic
But I don't think that cow really jumped over the moon

When will I wake up?
Why did we break up?
When will we make up?

When money grows on trees
People live in peace
Everyone agrees
When happiness is free
Love can guarantee
You'll come back to me, that's when

I'd love to wake up smiling, full of the joys of spring
And hear on CNN that Elvis lives again
And that John's back with the Beatles and they're going out on tour
I'll be the first in line for tickets
Gotta see that show for sure

When will I wake up?
Why did we break up?
When will we make up?

When money grows on trees
People live in peace
Everyone agrees
When happiness is free
Love can guarantee
You'll come back to me, that's when
Yeah

When will I wake up?
Why did we break up?
When will we make up?

When money grows on trees
People live in peace
Everyone agrees
When happiness is free
Love can guarantee
You'll come back to me, that's when
Oh, that's when

8 ContributorsSoldier Lyrics
Don't close the door when you leave
It's cold out
I need to see the air when you breathe
And say out loud
That you'll be home soon
Not to worry
You're gonna hurry back

Has anybody seen my soldier
Standing all alone?
Has anybody seen my soldier
Just tryna get home?

You're not alone when you dream
I'm with you
I hear your heart when it beats
I feel it too
Sleep in peace
Love is tender
Please remember me

Has anybody seen my soldier
Standing all alone?
Has anybody seen my soldier
Just tryna get home?

Where did you go, my love? (I need to know)
I need to know you're safe (So many miles)
So many miles between us
I need to see your face

Has anybody seen my soldier
Standing all alone?
Has anybody seen my soldier?

Standing all alone?

Ah
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh

I thought I might begin by fillin' you in
In case you didn't already know
I'll never forget how you got up and left
In fact, it was downright pretty low

There ain't no way I wanna, you know I ain't gonna
Take you back, so don't even try
You can beg, you can plead, you can sweat, you can bleed
It's too bad, I could care if you cry

Yeah, that's it (That's all)
We had fun (Had a ball)
It was good while it lasted
But now I'm past it
(It was short) It was sweet
Sure, you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then
But would I do it all again?
Nah

You won't find me naked and cold
Just a-sittin' on the doctor's table
Waitin' to be told
Just a-why I'm no longer able
To feel my heart beatin'
Gimme a good reason why
I kinda went numb
Just around about the time you told me
You were movin' on
And you said that you were gonna phone me
It's been so long
And there ain't nothin' wrong with the line

It's too late to regret it, but you're the one who said it
We're better off bein' apart
I hate to be a downer, but don't bother comin' 'round here
'Cause I won't have a change of heart (A change of heart)

Yeah, that's it (That's all)
We had fun (Had a ball)
It was good while it lasted
But now I'm past it
(It was short) It was sweet
Sure, you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then
But would I do it all again?
Nah

You won't find me naked and cold

Hey
Hey, yeah, yeah

Well, I hope you learned a lesson, 'cause you'll never be messin'
With my head again the way that you did
It was never gonna work, you were too much of a jerk
I'm finally fed up with it

Yeah, that's it (That's all)
We had fun (Had a ball)
It was good while it lasted
But now I'm past it
(It was short) It was sweet
Sure, you swept me off my feet

When you forget where you belong
I put on my favorite song to remind you
You're my best friend, that's who you are

Just remember who you got
When you feel a little lost, I'll find you
I'll remind you that's who you are
You're my best friend, that's who you are

No matter what, yeah, I got you
And I know that you got me, you got me too

(Yeah, you) When I trip, you pick me up

(Yeah, you) You're the one to call my mom
You always take the blame and you know I'd do the same
(Yeah, you) Each time I go too far
(Yeah, you) Hide the keys to my car
(Yeah, you) And like the friend you are
You always take the blame and you know I'd do the same for you

We've both made the same mistakes
Wakin' up in the wrong places wasted
Naked, that's who we are
Yeah, we're best friends, that's who we are
Remember we've still got the shirts
That we probably should've burned in Vegas (Let's go out to Vegas)
I bet they hate us at that casino bar
But it made us who we are

All the years and the tears that we've been through
Still, I know that you got me, I got you, too

You always take the blame and you know I'd do the same for you

Don't go and get me started
Don't you dare drive me crazy
Don't do that to me, baby

Found it in his closet
Right behind the lies
I wish I never saw it
The secret in his eyes
Poor me

He never told me how long
I'd been living in the dark
No one turned the light on
I fell and broke my heart
Poor me
Poor me

Poor me this, poor me that
Why do I keep looking back?
Poor me this, poor me that
It's not white, it’s not black
Grey's the color that I see
Still can't believe he'd leave me
To love her

Pour me another

Tried to face it
But so far down inside
I just can't shake it
My stupid pride
Poor me

Why do I keep looking back?

I know it should get better
Oh, but it never does
I wish he'd never met her
Then everything would be the way it was

Poor me this

Oh, no, no, no

Hope life's been good to you
Since you've been gone
I'm doing fine now — I've finally moved on
It's not so bad — I'm not that sad
I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive
I can't complain — I'm free again

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget

Don't think I'm lyin' 'round, cryin' at night
There's no need to worry, I'm really alright
I've never looked back — as a matter of fact

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget

It only hurts when I breathe
Mmm, no, I've never looked back
As a matter of fact

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget

Hurts when I'm breathing
Breaks when it's beating
Die when I'm dreaming
It only hurts when I breathe

I'm independent to a fault
I know this well
But I finally found love
Without losing myself
I'm so much happier sharing my life
All of the good things and bad things alike
I'm not afraid of the truth
I'm not me without you

Because of you, I'm me
All of a sudden, I'm something I wasn't
Because of you, I see
Everything I can be, lonely is history
I know that I'm better when we're together
Because of you, I'm me

Well, there's nothing wrong with the world
Oh, when you smile
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Is you breathing at night
When you're asleep and don't know I can hear
Sounds like an angel whispering in my ear
I don't know what I would do
If it wasn't for you

Because of you, I'm me
All of a sudden, I'm something I wasn't
Because of you, I see
Everything I can be, lonely is history
I know that I'm better when we're together
Because of you, I'm me

I don't need you
The way a child needs a home
It's more like I'm free to
Admit I'm not too proud to say out loud
I am who I am 'cause you're part of me now

Because of you, I'm me
All of a sudden, I'm something I wasn't
Because of you, I see
Everything I can be, lonely is history
I know that I'm better when we're together
Because of you, I'm me

Oh, because of you
I'm me

Summer's here, bring it on
Another year, one more beer, another song
Comes on the radio, so loud and clear
You whisper, "Come," in my ear

I follow like a season
Not afraid of what I'm feelin'
Oh

I'm swingin' with my eyes closed
Got my hair down, a wide open road
I'm swingin' with my eyes closed
Only God knows how far it goes

Fists up in the air (Fightin' for my freedom)
Go like we don't care
Swingin'
Ha

Life is short and nights are long
Nothin' sure in this world till we're gone
Fear disappears each time I close my eyes
I kiss you once—kiss, kiss—I kiss you twice

It's in the air we're breathin'
Oh, can you taste the freedom?
Oh, oh

I'm swingin' with my eyes closed
Got my hair down, a wide open road
I'm swingin' with my eyes closed
Only God knows how far it goes

Fists up in the air (Fightin' for my freedom)
Go like we don't care

(That road)
(Only God knows how far it goes)

(Swingin' with my eyes closed)
(Got my hair down, a wide open road)
I'm swingin' with my eyes closed
Only God knows how far it goes

Fists up in the air (Fightin' for my freedom)
Go like we don't care
Fists up in the air (Fightin' for my freedom)
Go like we don't care
Swingin'

[Song 44: Not Just a Girl]
9 ContributorsNot Just a Girl Lyrics
Turn the light on
And you're gonna see someone
That's gonna be somebody someday
Invisible lines
All the cynical minds
Think I don't know what to think or to say

Hold me, but don't you hold me down
Change is gonna come
But my patience running out
Made a decision
What the dictionary's
Missing is my definition
I'm not just a four letter word

I'm not just a girl
Just a girl
I'm not just a girl
Just a girl
I pack my suitcases
I'm going places
I'm gonna rule the world
I'm not just a girl (Hey)
I'm not just a girl (Hey)

We're sittin' in the kitchen
And we're talkin' our non-fiction
And the truth is comin' out tonight
Is that what you expected?
That I would just accept it?
To stand behind and not beside?

Hold mе, but don't you hold me down
Change is gonna come
But my patiеnce running out
Made a decision
What the dictionary's
Missing is my definition
I'm not just a four letter word

I'm not just a girl
Just a girl
I'm not just a girl
Just a girl
I pack my suitcases
I'm going places
I'm gonna rule the world
I'm not just a girl
I'm not just a girl

Gonna put it on
And wear it out
Dress it up with attitude
I'm looking fine
The night is mine
I don't know about you

I'm not just a girl
Just a girl
I'm not just a girl
Just a girl
I pack my suitcases
I'm going places
I'm gonna rule the world
I'm not just a girl
I'm not just a girl

Oh, just a girl
I'm not just a girl
Just a girl
I'm not just a girl

10 ContributorsWho’s Gonna Be Your Girl? Lyrics
Mm, mm

I don't need to know just where you're goin'
You don't need to tell me where you've been
All we have is here and now and nothin'
In between

Watchin' the night fall, there goes the sun
Walkin' the sidewalk that comes undone

Who's gonna be your girl
When all of the boys are gone?
And who's gonna stop the world
When livin' is no more fun?

When will you wake up
From all of the dreams that you make up?
And who's gonna be your girl tonight?
Mm, mm

When you leave to find yourself without me
I will keep the light on in my heart
Just in case you stop to think about me
In the dark

But you don't want nothin' good to last
You fill up the fire in your glass

Who's gonna be your girl
When all of the boys are gone?
And who's gonna stop the world
When livin' is no more fun?

When will you wake up
From all of the dreams that you make up?
And who's gonna be your girl tonight?

You down the fire, it burns a hole
Deep inside you, it feels so cold
I walk the wire and it falls away
I tried to find you 'cause I loved you, babe

Who's gonna be your girl
When all of the boys are gone?
And who's gonna stop the world
When livin' is no more fun?

When will you wake up
From all of the dreams that you make up?
And who's gonna be your girl tonight?

If I were the wind, I would make you fly
I'm jealous of that too
Mmm, yeah, yeah

I wish I were the sun shining on your face
Caressing like a lover
I would wrap you up in a warm embrace
We'd be holding one another

I just can't get you close enough, no

When the sun's on your skin
I can't hold it in
And I know it's a sin
But I'm jealous of the sun

I wish I were the rain running down your neck
And dripping from your fingers
Then I could be the drops rolling off your back
I'd love to let it linger
(Jealous of the rain) Oh, I'm jealous of the rain (Jealous of the rain)

Oh, I don't wanna share you with nothing else
I gotta have you to myself
I can't help it, I'm so in love (So in love)

When it rains on your face (When it rains on your face)
I almost can taste (I almost can taste)
Your beauty, your grace (So beautiful)
I'm jealous of the rain
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, I'm jealous of the rain

When the wind's in your hair (I can feel it blowing)
The way it blows through the air (It's so unfair)
Oh, it seems so unfair, yeah
When the moon's in your eyes (Moon's in your eyes)
You seem to light up the skies (Light up the skies)

Yeah, and I realize
I'm even jealous of the moon

Keep those lights on
I'm comin' home

7 ContributorsLight of My Life Lyrics
Today, to you, I'm invisible
Tomorrow, you may still be out of reach
But, someday, you and I will be possible
We'll be alone, makin' love on the beach
By then, we won't remember what it was like (Mm-hm)
Before you and I fell in love (Mm-hm)
That we were ever not together in this life (Mm-hm)
Hard to imagine the way it was

You are the light of my life (You are the light of my life)
My little piece of the pie (My little piece of the pie)
American beauty, apple of my eye (American beauty)
You are the light of my life (You are the light of my life)
(Mm-hm, mm-hm)

I've heard people say that if they could
Do it all over again, they never would
It's better to have loved someone and lost
Than to have never loved at all (Mm-hm)
I am not afraid to give my heart
Even though you don't know I exist (Mm-hm)
'Cause, in my sleep, you hold me close in the dark (Mm-hm)
A million times, I've tasted your lips

You are the light of my life (You are the light of my life)
My little piece of the pie (My little piece of the pie)
American beauty, apple of my eye (American beauty)
You are the light of my life (You are the light of my life)

I'm savin' myself for you
There is no wait long enough, ain't no way I'm givin' up
Maybe I'm a fool
But nothin' makes me feel so right than dreamin' about you at night

You are the light of my life
My little piece of the pie
American beauty, apple of my eye (American beauty)
You are the light of my life (You are the light of my life)
You are the light of my life (You are the light of my life)

Reach the top and start to cry
Heaven looked me in the eye
Afraid to jump, but had to try
Exhaled and said "goodbye"
I'm flying
I'm flying

Always knew I had to go
Find the me I did not know
Who I'd be when I got old
Just how far the wind would blow
I'm sailing
I'm sailing

All in all this much is true
Cause love and hate and they both burn
Peace and war, they take turns
All in all there's nothing new
I'm still myself, but I've changed
Things I always thought were strange
Aren't that strange at all
All in all
All in all

God is older than I am
He was where it all began
I try to do the best I can
To see truth from where I stand
I'm praying
I'm praying

All in all this much is true
Cause love and hate and they both burn
Peace and war, they take turns
All in all there's nothing new
I'm still myself, but I've changed

[Song 51: Home Ain’t Where His Heart Is (Anymore)]
10 ContributorsHome Ain’t Where His Heart Is (Anymore) Lyrics“Home Ain’t Where His Heart Is (Anymore)”
is the seventh single from Twain’s album The Woman In Me. The song was the first to not reach the top 20 on the country chart.
He knew how to reach me deep inside
And he found a part of me I could not hide
And we'd walk and talk and touch tenderly
Then he'd lay me down and make love to me

We built a love so strong it couldn't break
There was not a road we were afraid to take
And we'd kiss all the way from Arkansas to Rome
'Cause in each other's arms, we were home sweet home

But he don't feel the same
Since our lives became
Years of bills, babies and chains

Oh, home ain't where his heart is anymore
He may hang his hat behind our bedroom door
But he don't lay his head down to love me like before
Home ain't where his heart is anymore

If foundations made of stone can turn to dust
Then the hardest hearts of steel can turn to rust
If he could only find that feeling once again
If we could only change the way the story ends

And he may still come home
But I live here alone
The love that built these walls is gone

Home ain't where his heart is anymore
He may hang his hat behind our bedroom door
But he don't lay his head down to love me like before
(Home)

He don't lay his head down to love me like before
Home ain't where his heart is anymore
No, home ain't where his heart is

'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long
No one can tell me I'm wrong
I ain't goin' down

I had a baby at fifteen
Daddy never did forgive me
I never heard from the guy again, oh
I had to drop outta high school
Everybody treated me so cruel
But I didn't give in and give her away

I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long
No one can tell me I'm wrong
I ain't goin' down

Her smile got me through the day
And every night I'd pray
I could give her enough
At night, I'd lie awake and cry
Hoping we'd get by
'Cause you can't live on love

I worked night and day to keep us goin'
Through the sweat and tears without her knowing
It was worth it just to watch her grow
Oh, oh
At least I was able to hold her
Whenever she needed my shoulder
I'm so glad I never let her go

Oh, I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long
No one can tell me I'm wrong
I ain't goin' down

Her smile got me through the years
Dried away the tears
It filled me with hope
At night, I'd lie awake and cry
Prayed we would get by
And for the courage to go, oh


Her smile got me through the day
And every night, I'd pray
I could give her enough

I'm gonna hold on (Hold on)
'Cause what I believe in is so strong (So strong)
No matter how long

[Song 59: You Shook Me All Night Long]
2 ContributorsYou Shook Me All Night Long LyricsShania Twain covered AC/DC’s notable song “You Shook Me All Night Long” in 2003 for her TV special, Up! Close and Personal
He was a fast machine, he kept his motor clean
He was the best darn looking guy I've ever seen
He had sexy eyes, telling me no lies
He was knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than his share, he had me fighting for air
I wanted to run, but I was already there
Cause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
You shook me all night long

I'm working double-time on the seduction line
He was one of a kind, he was mine, all mine
Wanted no applause, it's just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
Because the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking

'Case you never look back
I want you to know that you were loved like mad
I hope you live long enough to change your mind

Where do you think you're goin'?
I wanna go with you, can I come, too?
Nobody knows you better
Nobody loves you quite like I do

He'll cuss, he swears, he tells bad jokes
And he ropes, and he rides
He lives life fast, and he loves to fight
He's a boozer, a loser

Well, he flirts too much and he loves blonde chicks
And he struts, and he strolls

It's Monday and I hear you when you say you hate that day
Me too, but there's nothing much about it we can do
Let's just get to counting down the hours
Dreaming of all of our favorite songs
We know the words by heart and we will shout and be
Singing along as loud as we like
Friday night

More fun is what we need
Everyone is on their feet
The weekend's here and all we want to do is be together
Get a little crazy and forget what happens later
We made it through the week
Now we're headed to the streets
More fun is what we need

One day we'll be sitting back, laughing all about the times
We were doing donuts in the parking lots and running lights
The time of our lives is here and now and yes, we got the power
Cause we know it all
We're just getting started, open hearted, having a ball
And nothing but time on our side

More fun is what we need
Everyone is on their feet
The weekend's here and all we want to do is be together
Get a little crazy and forget what happens later
We made it through the week
Now we're headed to the street

The day was long but the night is young and we ain't got to worry
We're running out of light, but that's alright
No one needs to hurry
Morning such a long way away
And we, we got all night to play

More fun is what we need
Everyone is on their feet
The weekend's here and all we want to do is be together
Get a little crazy and forget what happens later
We made it through the week (we made it)
Now we're headed to the street

Cause more fun is what we need
More fun is all we need

Know her

I just knew he wanted to
Know her

He's starting to embarrass me
I may even have to hose him down
Bring me water!
I don't know what he finds so distracting
What's so hot about her
I really don't like the way he's acting
Bring me water!
Bring it on

Oh
What's so hot about her?
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You’re so warm like the sun, like the sun
The world goes away every time that you lay
In my arms and you're sayin' my name

Late nights, lyin' in my bed
Angels flowin' 'round my head
Your fingers goin' down my back, down my back
Each timе you wake up beside mе

Just the two of us, hands everywhere
Shadows on the ceilin', floatin’ kinda feelin'
I like the way, I like the way you free me

Late nights, lyin' in my bed
Angels flowin' 'round my head
Your fingers goin' down my back, down my back
Each time you wake up beside me

I just said goodbye
And you didn't care
Enough to ask me why
I was hopin' that you wouldn't blow this
But you just kept tryin' to control this
Typical you, didn't notice me leave

You prick, you sting, you made me bleed
I cut you out when you cut me deep
So I deleted our history
'Cause you'll always be the same old you
But I'm a brand-new me
Brand new
But I'm a brand-new me

You took it too low
When you got there, I was gone
Now I talk about you in the past tense
Got to the end of a sentence
Without you finishing it for me

You prick, you sting, you made mе bleed
I cut you out when you cut me deep
So I delеted our history
'Cause you'll always be the same old you
But I'm a brand-new me

Oh, you're so, you're so, you're so in love

Well, he shines like a penny in a little kid's hand
When he's out on a Saturday night
He's a real go-getter and the best two-stepper you'll see
But when I'm sittin' alone at a table for two
'Cause he's already out on the floor
I think about somethin' that my mama used to say to me

You got to dance with the one that brought you
Stay with the one that wants you
The one who's gonna love you when all of the others go home
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let the moon get to ya
Dance with the one that brought you and you can't go wrong

He's got his old best buddies and his new best friends
And the girls give him the eye
He's a good time Charlie and the life of the party tonight
But when I think about another, well, I don't think twice
'Cause there'll never be another like him
I know he really loves me and I think maybe mama was right

You got to dance with the one that brought you
Stay with the one that wants you
The one who's gonna love you when all of the others go home
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let the moon get to ya
Dance with the one that brought you and you can't go wrong

You've got to dance with the one that brought you
And you can't go wrong

Maybe tonight I'm gonna tell him how I feel
Maybe I'll leave well enough alone
Maybe, just maybe, he'll wanna be my baby
What if he's got plans of his own?
I'm waiting for the perfect moment
Looking for the perfect phrase
The one I finally choose is simply "I love you"
As the words came out, I heard a voice inside me say

What made you say that?
Was it the moonlight? Was it the starlight in your eyes?
What made you say that?
Have you been listening to your heart?
It's too late now, you don't wanna take it back
'Cause I know love's what made you say that

I look up to see his reaction
And a smile slowly spread across his face
He said, "What took you so long?
That's what I've been waiting on
I thought you'd take forever and a day"

What made you say that?
Was it the moonlight? Was it the starlight in your eyes?
What made you say that?
Have you been listening to your heart?
It's too late now, I won't let you take it back
'Cause I know love's what made you say that

When life gives you lemons
They pour down from the heavens
This is what you've got to do
Make some lemonade
Drink it in the shade
Don't let a bad day get to you

You've got no money to your name
But all you need is heart anyway

You can't buy love
But you can make it
You can't make sunshine
But you can make love

When you get suspicious
That someone wants your wishes
Even more than you do
Don't waste your time fighting
Better spend it finding what you really want for you

You don't need money and you don't need fame
Cause all you need is heart anyway

You can't buy love
But you can make it
You can't make sunshine
But you can make love
No, you can't buy love
Oh, but you can make it
You can't make sunshine
But you can make love

Without love we would be blind
There'd be no kind
In this little world
There'd be no girl
There'd be no boy
There'd be no joy

You can't buy love
But you can make it
You can't make sunshine
But you can make love
No, you can't buy love
But you can make it
You can't make sunshine
But you can make love
I said you can't buy love
But you can make it
Oh, you can't make sunshine
But you can make love
Uh huh, yeah!

When I first saw you, I saw love
And the first time you touched me, I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love
Mmm, yeah

Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday

They said, “I bet they'll never make it”
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong

(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight

Ain't nothing better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missing

They said, “I bet they'll never make it”
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong

(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life

You're still the one I kiss goodnight
You're still the one

The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight

I'm so glad we made it
Look how far we've come my baby

Exfoliate, look great
Feel guilty 'bout what you ate
You're buying all the books
To learn the latest looks, yeah

Erase the Rings around your eyes
Cover what you can
Get a Coppertone tan, yeah

Stabilize the mood you're in
You're back on diet food again
Bigger is the best, but only in the chest, yeah
What a way to wanna be (Wanna be)

To keep up with the latest trend
But we don't get no satisfaction
Living like a slave to fashion
No more thinking for yourself

No, oh, it's not worth it
Don't be so obsessed
C'mon, give it a rest
This is not some contest, just do your best

Yeah, how insane to be so vain
It's so synthetic, I just don't get it
I don't get it, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't be so obsessed
C'mon, give it a rest
This is not some contest, just do your best
'Cause no-o-body's perfect

Oh, nobody's perfect

This is not some contest (Nobody's perfect)
What a way to wanna be

I think you're funny, you think I'm smart
'Cause I can name the planets all by heart
Almost touching, but too shy to start
Eyes wide open, it's way past dark

It's too late to sleep now
The valley's wide awake
The early train is pullin' out
Too wired to come down
It's the last day of summer
And the first kiss on my lover's mouth

(Ooh-ooh)

Did you get married or did you wait?
Did you ever build that house down by the lake?
Nights still find me lyin' awake
'Cause every time I close my eyes, I see your face

It's too late to sleep now (Too late to sleep now)
The vallеy's wide awake
The еarly train is pullin' out
Too high to come down (Too high to come down)

Stirring up a feeling I thought I'd never find
Ever since I met you, babe, I've been living in a dream

You lay a whole lot of love on me
A whole lot of love on me

I get warm all over when you get close to me
Then I start to tremble from my head down to my feet
I become your piece of clay to do with what you please

You lay a whole lot of love on me
A whole lot of love on me

You lay a whole lot of love on me
A love I thought could never be
Let the whole world fall apart, you're all I ever need

You lay a whole lot of love on me
A whole lot of love on me

You lay a whole lot of love on me
A whole lot of love on me

While you're out there havin' fun
Rubbin' up against someone else
I'd be curled up in your chair
Waitin' for you with my hair
Fallin' pretty down my back
Like a statue sittin' on a shelf

Tears chokin' down

I'm goin' to town

I'm done and dusted

Out of prison and I'm
Lovin' livin' without you

I am singin' in my car
Lookin' like a movie star
Hair a mess and my dress is blowin'
Goin' somewhere good for my heart

Windows down, music on
It's the achy-breaky song
Dancin' in my seat (dancin')
Groovin', movin' on to my next start

Out of prison and I
Love livin' without you

Free, of freedom (respect, I demand your respect, I demand your)
I don't hate you, but I'm movin' on (respect, I demand your respect, I demand your)

By the time you wake up, I'll be gone (respect, I demand your respect)

Every road had a rainbow
And every wish had a star
Every tear had a shoulder to cry on
And every night had guitars
But every fool's a lonely fool
And such a fool am I
'Cause every night I think of you
And every night I die

Is there life after love?
Some things aren't certain
But some things I'm sure of
Like angels in heaven
And God up above
But is there life after love?

You gave me forgiveness
But you could not forget
No, I should never have told you
What I'll live to regret
The truth lies between us
And I can't take it back
No, it's too late for lying now
It's too late for that

Is there life after love?
Some things aren't certain
But some things I'm sure of
Like angels in heaven
And God up above
But is there life after love?

Here I am, there you are
We're so far apart
Let's pretend that I've never been
In his hands, in his heart
Can't we just start
All over again?

Is there life after love?
Some things aren't certain
But some things I'm sure of
Like angels in heaven
And God up above
But is there life after love?

Is there life after love?

[Song 90: Coat of Many Colors]
5 ContributorsCoat of Many Colors LyricsBack through the years I go wandering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love she made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
As she sewed she told a story from the bible she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and mama blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors that my mama made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had money but I was rich as I could be in my coat of many colors
My mama made for me
So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and a making fun of me
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
And oh I couldn't understand for I felt I was rich
And I told them all the love my mama sewed in every stich
And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
But they didn't understand and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we have no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors mama made for me
Made just for me

It takes two hearts with one beat
And it takes two to say "I do"
But the champagne won't taste sweet
And the dream just won't come true
If it don't take two
Noah knew what he had to do, oh yeah
He sent us out in the world walking two by two
Me and you

(If it don't take two) If it don't take two
(If it don't take two) And if I'm not with you
No, it ain't worth going through
If it don't take two

He sent us out in the world walking two by two
Me and you
Baby

If it don't take two (If it don't take two)
And if I'm not with you
No, it ain't worth going through
If it don't take two
No, it don't take two (If it don't take two)
If it don't take two (If I'm not with you)
No, it ain't worth going through
(If it don't take two) If it don't take two
(If it don't take two) And if I'm not with you
No, it ain't worth going through, baby
(If it don't take two) If it don't take two

[Song 92: Leaving Is The Only Way Out]
5 ContributorsLeaving Is The Only Way Out Lyrics
I'm not saying I have all the answers
And I don't care who's right or wrong
I'm trying to pick up the pieces already fallen
And put them back where they belong

So slow down your horses
Stop dragging me around
And if crying is the only way into your heart
Then leaving is the only way out

We've slammed every door in anger
And we've opened wounds we can't mend
And one night lonely is one night too many
Don't wanna wake up to one more night that won't end

So slow down your horses
Stop dragging love around
And if crying is the only way into your heart
Then leaving is the only way out

When late nights and long lies came knocking
You just invited them in
And our voices got too loud for talking
Then my heart hit the floor
But your feet just kept walking

And if crying is the only way you hear me hurting
For the loving that I can't live without
And if loving ain't the only way into your heart
Then leaving is the only way out
Oh, leaving is the only way out

[Song 93: Raining On Our Love]
5 ContributorsRaining On Our Love Lyrics
Remember me, the way I was
The way I'd make you late for work
I had to hold you, just because
Remember you, the way you'd wake me up
To love me once again
We were lovers, we were friends

But was I chasing rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for making you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

Remember when, just to feel my touch
Was all you ever needed
Oh, it used to be enough
Remember when love
Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

But was I chasing rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for making you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

I was taking all the love you had to give
But I was too lost in life to know
That without my love in return you could not live
Now she gives the love I did not show

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for making you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

5 ContributorsGod Ain’t Gonna Getcha for That Lyrics
Hey, you, sitting in the corner
Can't ya hear the jukebox playing?
Everybody's up doing the two-step
And you're not even tappin' your toe
Won't you let a lady buy you a cold brew?
Loosen you up a little more than you dare to?
Maybe take a ride in my Cadillac
God ain't gonna getcha for that

God ain't gonna getcha for that
He's much too busy with the guys in the black hats
There's nothing wrong with a man and a woman
Flirting with a honky-tonk moon
God ain't gonna pay no attention
If we're just making use of his invention
Come on, baby, don't hold back
God ain't gonna getcha for that

I can tell you're the quiet type
Are you new in town or just a little bit shy?
Didn't you ever catch me looking?
I've been eyeing you all night
Won't you let a lady buy you a cold brew?
Loosen you up a little more than you dare to?
Maybe take a ride in my Cadillac?
God ain't gonna getcha for that

God ain't gonna getcha for that
He's much too busy with the guys in the black hats
There's nothing wrong with a man and a woman
Flirting with a honky-tonk moon, no

Come on, baby, don't hold back

And for anything I forgot to say too

But there's never the time, never the place
So this letter will have to do
I love you

Ow
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're somethin' else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist

That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch?
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

Uh-huh, yeah, yеah

I never knew a guy who carriеd a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve just in case
And all that extra-hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
'Cause heaven forbid it should fall outta place

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're somethin' else
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt

That don't impress me much
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

Ow
Yeah
Woo

You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car goodnight
Now come on, baby, tell me, you must be jokin', right?

Oh-oh, you think you're somethin' special
Oh-oh, you think you're somethin' else
Okay, so you got a car

That don't impress me much
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much (That don't impress me)
Oh-oh, no, you think you're cool, but have you got the touch?
Now, now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely nights
That don't impress me much

Hey, Shania
All right, Sabrina?
Are you ready?
I'm so ready

Santa, baby
Slip a Sable under the tree for me
I've been an awfully good girl
Santa, baby
Hurry down the chimney tonight

Mm-mm

A '54 convertible too, light blue
Yeah, I'll wait up for you, dear
Santa, baby
And hurry down the chimney tonight

Oh, think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year, I could be just as good
If you checked off my Christmas list

Santa, baby
I want a yacht and really that's not (That's it?), that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year
Santa, baby
And hurry down the chimney tonight

Mm, Santa, honey
One little thing that I really do need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa, honеy
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Sing it

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With somе decorations bought at Tiffany's
Said I really do believe in you
And let's see if you believe in me

Santa, baby
Forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa, baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight, uh-huh
Hurry down the chimney tonight, yes, sir
Said hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, hurry down the chimney tonight

7 ContributorsWhen He Leaves You Lyrics
I come here as a friend
Though I don't really know you
I know you're in love with him
And he's made your world brand new
I know you think he loves you
And he may believe it too
Pour some coffee and I'll tell you
What you'll soon be going through

When he leaves you
It's gonna more than break your heart
When he leaves you
It's gonna tear your world apart
And you're gonna cry a million teardrops
One for every shattered dream
When he leaves you
And comes back home to me

I've known him all these years
Honey, this time's not the first time
I've paid for loving him with tears
And when it's over, he'll be mine
I can see that I've upset you
I guess I'm a fool to try and help
When it comes to hearts and heartache
You gotta find out for yourself

When he leaves you
It's gonna more than break your heart
When he leaves you
It's gonna tear your world apart
And you're gonna cry a million teardrops
One for every shattered dream
When he leaves you
And comes back home to me

When he leaves you
And comes back home to me

I'm on the verge of leavin' everything
All you have to do is read my mind
Honestly, I'm fall-asleep-y
Don't keep me waitin' this time

Tonight, the only tears I have
Depends how hard you make me laugh

Bone dry (Bone dry)
Been surfin' above the ageless (Been surfin' high above the ageless, frozen in time)
Frozen in time, all the faces (All the faces, places gone by, motionless eyes)
Motionless еyes, colours faded (Colours faded, too much sunshinе, so much blue sky)
Too much sunshine, so much blue sky (Bone dry)
And I'm bone dry

The river's higher than it's ever been (Mm)
Let's dive in and try to touch (Mm)
I can't swim, beneath my skin (Mm)
I feel the rage, I feel the rush (Mm)

If today is all we have
Then it's too late to make me sad

(Do ya love, do ya love, do ya love, do ya love?)
Bone dry (Bone dry)
Been surfin' above the ageless (Been surfin' high above the ageless, frozen in time)
(Do ya love, do ya love, do ya love, do ya love?)
Frozen in time, all the faces (All the faces, places gone by, motionless eyes)
(Do ya love, do ya love, do ya love, do ya love?)
Motionless eyes, colours faded (Colours faded, too much sunshine, so much blue sky)
(Do ya love, do ya love, do ya love, do ya love?)
Too much sunshine, so much blue sky (Bone dry)
And I'm bone dry

2 ContributorsLove Lyrics
Time goes by, I know that I'm learning
Love, It lies and No wonder I'm hurting
I can see the lies all over your face
Only hope that time can help erase
The pain, the tears that I'm crying
I can see in your eyes your love is dying
I should have known that you lied when you said to believe
That you'd love me enough that you'd never leave
But you just turned and walked away, you left me standing in the rain
You didn't take my love for real, now how am I to feel
Love comes in and goes out like a season
You came in and walked out for no reason
Do you really know what love is about?
You really had me thinking there wasn't a doubt

That you would love me forever
You wanted me to know
That I had to love you now or never
But then you let me go

[Song 103: Crime of the Century]
5 ContributorsCrime of the Century Lyrics
I was into bein' out on my own
I could take love or leave it alone
That's how you get when you're hurt to the bone
One too many times
I had this heart of mine locked away
I kept my guard up night and day
I had enough of the games they play
Out there on the line

It was the crime of the century
You played Robin Hood and rescued me
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ain't got nothing on you
You came on like Jesse James
You stole my heart like you were robbing trains
I'm gonna lock you up for life with me
It was the crime of the century

You stacked the deck, you didn't gamble at all
You knew exactly how the cards would fall
You bet your heart, but as I recall
I didn't even stand a chance
I bet you had an ace up your sleeve
An' here I thought that you were so naive
You took my hand an' made me believe
In love an' a real romance

It was the crime of the century
You played Robin Hood and rescued me
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ain't got nothing on you
You came on like Jesse James
You stole my heart like you were robbing trains
I'm gonna lock you up for life with me
It was the crime of the century

And if I live to be a hundred and one
Well, honey, don't you think that it would be fun
To do it all over again?

It was the crime of the century
You played Robin Hood and rescued me
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ain't got nothing on you
You came on like Jesse James
You stole my heart like you were robbing trains
I'm gonna lock you up for life with me
It was the crime of the century

I'm gonna lock you up and throw away the key
It was the crime of the century
It was love in the third degree
It was the crime of the century

My first lesson losing a love was you
Learning to live with your memory was lesson number two
I can't lie, baby, I still cry sometimes
But I've come a long way towards getting you out of my mind

I'm still under the weather, but I'm over the storm
I still miss the shelter of your loving arms
But what I thought would kill me has just made me strong
I'm still under the weather, but I'm over the storm

Sometimes your memory still gets the best of me
But that lonely ache in my heart ain't as bad as it used to be
Sometimes the way that I'm feeling inside doesn't show
But I know I'll get over you, I've just got a long way to go

I'm still under the weather, but I'm over the storm
And I still miss the shelter of your loving arms
But what I thought would kill me has just made me strong
I'm still under the weather, but I'm over the storm

I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm

Huh, me too, but I ain't got no clue, how 'bout you?
Men are like shoes, made to confuse
Yeah, there's so many of 'em
I don't know which ones to choose
Ah, sing it to me if you agree
There's the kind made for running
The sneakers and the low down heels
The kind that will keep you on your toes
And every girl knows how that feels (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh) Ouch, ah, sing it with me

Ya got your kickers and your ropers, your everyday loafers
And some that you can never find
You've got your slippers and your zippers, your grabbers and your grippers
Man, don't you hate that kind?
Some you wear in, an' some you wear out
Some you wanna leave behind
Sometimes you hate 'em, an' sometimes you love 'em
I guess it all depends on which way you rub 'em
But a girl can never have too many of 'em

It's amazing what a little polish will do
Men are like shoes

Some make you feel ten feet tall
Some make you feel so small
An' some you want to leave out in the hall
Or make you feel like kicking the wall (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ah, sing it with me, girls
Ooh! (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mmm

Ya got your kickers and your ropers, your everyday loafers
And some that you can never find
You've got your slippers and your zippers, your grabbers and your grippers
Man, don't you hate that kind?
Some you wear in, an' some you wear out
Some you wanna leave behind
Sometimes you hate 'em, an' sometimes you love 'em
I guess it all depends on which way you rub 'em
But a girl can never have too many of 'em

Some can polish up pretty good
Ah, all men are like shoes

It's amazing what a little polish will do
Some clean up good, just like new
Some you can't afford, some are real cheap
Some are good for bumming around on the beach

Ya got your kickers and your ropers, your everyday loafers
Yeah, some that you can never find
You've got your slippers and your zippers, your grabbers and your grippers
And man, don't you hate that kind?
Ya got your kickers and your ropers, your everyday loafers
And some that you can never find
You've got your slippers and your zippers, your grabbers and your grippers
An' man, don't you hate that kind?
Some you wear in, an' some you wear out
Some you wanna leave behind
Sometimes you hate 'em, an' sometimes you love 'em
I guess it all depends on which way you rub 'em
But a girl can never have too many of 'em

I ain't got time for the flip-flop kind
Men are like shoes

(Wanted man)
(That's me)
(Wanted man)

You woke up in a bar, in a chair, with a new scar
In no hurry, seein' nothin' but blurry and big stars
With a guitar and a song, you barely got along
Fightin' with your friends—pain, blame, shame—and they hit hard

You were goin' down fast, about to kiss the ground, no class
Rejected, disrespected, a perfected loser
A fail, go to jail, till I found you, walked around you
And said, "I don't play" (Ah, I woke up)

I made you wake up with the feel of my lips
I made you stand up, yeah, the curve of my hips
I made you feel love with my fingertips
I made you a wanted man
Yeah, ooh

You love me like you mean it, pinch yourself, you can't believe it
All my friends say, "Leave him," that you ain't good enough
But you're a different man when I see ya, you don't need tequila
'Cause I'm smoother and I'm sweeter—oh, man, are you in love?

You were goin' down fast, about to kiss the ground, no class
Rejected, disrespected, a perfected loser
A fail, go to jail, till I found you, walked around you
And said, "I don't play" (Ah, I woke up)
Ha

I made you wake up with the feel of my lips
I made you stand up, yeah, the curve of my hips
I made you feel love with my fingertips
I made you a wanted man

(That's me)
Ooh, I made you wanted

(Yeah) Yeah

I made you wake up with the feel of my lips
I made you stand up, yeah, the curve of my hips
I made you feel love with my fingertips (You know I made)

Made you a wanted man (Oh, yes, I've made you such a wanted man)
I made you a wanted man (That's me)

6 ContributorsThere Goes the Neighborhood Lyrics
The house next door just came up for sale
She's goin' home to mama, she says he can go to hell
The couple down the block is splitting up, I hear
And they're the third ones on our street this year

It's just another day in Anytown, USA
Somebody's hurt, somebody's blue
And somebody moves away
What little they do to make it work
Don't seem to do much good
When love moves out
There goes the neighborhood

First, they take off their wedding bands
They call it quits and call the moving vans
He takes his and she takes hers
And what's left over is left on the curb

It's just another day in Anytown, USA
Somebody's hurt, somebody's blue
And somebody moves away
What little they do to make it work
Don't seem to do much good
When love moves out
There goes the neighborhood

It's just another day in Anytown, USA
Somebody's hurt, somebody's blue
And somebody moves away
What little they do to make it work
Don't seem to do much good
When love moves out
There goes the neighborhood
When love moves out
There goes the neighborhood

[Song 110: Got a Hold on Me]
5 ContributorsGot a Hold on Me Lyrics
You got a hold on me, you're standing over me
Sometimes I hardly breathe at all
I need a little room, I need a lot of moon
I gotta find it soon or I'll fall
Into the emptiness, into the dark abyss
Too deep to climb the walls
Sometimes I wanna flee, but that could never be
You got a hold on me

You got a hold on me
And I'm dancing to your song
You got a hold on me
And it's my heart you're holding on

You got the sweetest smile, you got a certain style
And I can never get enough
Of the way you move and the way we groove
When it's feeling right to the touch
Then you turn around and you stomp me down
And you want to call it love
You know it makes me bleed, but I could never leave
You got a hold on me

You got a hold on me
And I'm dancing to your song
You got a hold on me
And it's my heart you're holding on
You got a hold on me
And I'm dancing to your song
You got a hold on me
And it's my heart you're holding on

4 ContributorsHate To Love Lyrics
Midnight sky shining on my face
I feel the waves embracing me
I'm here to find some peace of mind
Time and tide it waits for me, it waits for me, yeah

So here I am again somewhere in between, hate to love
Trying to find reality in a dream, hate to love
I'm afraid to say I need someone like you, hate to love
Oh, hate to love

Faded photograph, a picture perfect love
Locked inside this frame of mine
Forgiving truth is the trust betrayed
If time heals all that left me behind, it left me behind


Loneliness and innocence
With you invade my heart
I've learned to hate the truth of love
It's tearing me apart

3 ContributorsIt’s Alright Lyrics
Nothing's better than spending time together
Hanging around
Wish it was forever, love and sunny weather
Shining down
Ooh, you're my lover
There's no other, yeah
Friends like me and you
Can share a little loving too

And it's alright
We're getting it together every night
Making every minute very right
Loving everything we feel, yeah

And it's so good
Doing all the things we never could
Even if we're not sure that we should
Together it's you and me, yeah

Building sandcastles, being little rascals
Having fun
Playing on the beach just staying
Out of reach of everyone
Ooh, let's forever
Stay together, yeah
Let's keep what we got forgetting
What we ought to do

[Song 114: Wild And Wicked]
4 ContributorsWild And Wicked Lyrics
Full moon I'm craving just a little
Young love from an innocent one
No shame, it's purely noncommittal
It's the only way to go if you want to have fun
Kick start the rhythm, pull out on the road
Relying on an overload
I need some baby blues reflecting in the mirror
Telling me all the things I want to hear

Loved and lost, I've paid a painful cost
Feel my love, I've reached the point of no return

I'm wild and a wicked
Wild and a wicked for love
Wild and a wicked
Wild and a wicked for love

I need a guy that's full of sex appeal
I need a guy that looks good in the red
I want someone with a heart that I can steal
I want someone to drive me out of my head
Tight jeans, cute and the way I might behave
Ever trouble you might say
All the things you said it
Ooh I want him in the back that way

[Song 115: Forget Me]

Like you forgot to come home at night
Forget me
Like you've forgotten to hold me tight
Now you're sorry, now you cry
But don't you wipe those tears 'til your memories run dry
Please forget me

Don't let the lonely days remind you of anything
Oh baby, try to erase the fact we had everything
No, you can't come back this time
So let me slip right outta your mind

Forget me
Like you forgot to come home at night
Forget me
Like you've forgotten to hold me tight
Now you're sorry, now you cry
But don't you wipe those tears 'til your memories run dry
Please forget me

'Cause I forgot to forgive and forget
So just pretend we never met

Forget me
Like you forgot to come home at night
Forget me
Like you've forgotten to hold me tight
Well, now you're sorry, now you cry
But don't you wipe those tears 'til your memories run dry
Please forget me

[Song 116: The Heart Is Blind]
2 ContributorsThe Heart Is Blind Lyrics
I hear the slamming of the door there you go again
I can take it anymore that's just the way it is
Ooh, but then I listen to my heart and the anger fade
I want to hold you never let you go away

I feel a raging war inside
A battle between the heart and mind
But love wins when I close my eyes

The heart is blind, it will not see
When hope is gone, the heart will still believe
I see you go with tearful eyes
But for the sake of love, the heart is blind

I know there's been a lot of nights when we couldn't sleep
The words are like a knives, they cut so deep
Ooh, but when I listen to my heart it's deeper than the pain
Ooh, I really love you, that's all that matters anyway



I'll always love you and hard times will only
Make us strong if we keep holding on

I got to a 9-5 that seems like it never ends
I got a touchy boss that wants me in his hands, yeah
And no is a word that he doesn't understand
He says, "Baby can you work with me until 9?"
I know he knows that I could use the overtime, yeah
But I can tell he's going to hand me another line

I got to bite my lip, keep it inside
Got to bite my lip, just let it ride
I got to bite my lip, watch what I say
Got to bite my lip, just walk away

Yeah I'm rushing home, I got a hot date tonight yeah
I got a chilled champagne for dinner by candle light
He's going to be here soon and everything'll be alright
I get a call and guess who's on the other line
I can't make it tonight, can we do it another time? Yeah
Oh what nerve, I'd like to give him a piece of my mind

Whose bed have your boots been under?
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
But whose bed have your boots been under?

Don't look so lonely
Don't act so blue
I know I'm not the only
Girl you run to
I know about Lolita
Your little Spanish flame
I've seen you around with Rita
The redhead down the lane

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

I heard you've been sneaking
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill
And I've seen you walking
With long-legs Louise
And you weren't just talking
Last night with Denise

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

Come on, boots
Oh yeah (Come on)
So next time you're lonely
Don't call on me
Try the operator
Maybe she'll be free

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder?
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

I wanna know whose bed, baby

[Song 120: Send It With Love]
3 ContributorsSend It With Love Lyrics
Whenever I think of you
It seems so unfair
That I have to close my eyes
To see you there
I know I'm making it now
But it's tough
I can't begin to tell you enough
The pain is too much

And I give my heart in a prayer
Send it with love
You just say the words
I'll be there
Send it with love

I've come to realize that
I'm on my own
So whenever I'm scared inside
I dream that your home
Hard to say
How everything happened so fast
So many questions to ask
Oh


Is it right or is it wrong
To want you here so much
But I can never bring you back
So I feel what I can't touch
I've come to realize that
I'm on my own

[Song 121: Beauty and the Beast]
6 ContributorsBeauty and the Beast Lyrics
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

4 ContributorsFor the Love of Him Lyrics
When he opens the door, says I'm home
Be aware of the look in his eyes
They'll tell you the mood he's in
What kind of day it's been

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

There'll be a times when he won't say a word
And you'll wonder if it's something you said
A gentle touch of your hand
Will tell him you understand


Little things he forgets to do
Have you told him today I love you
When he reaches out, I'll be there
Show him how much you care

He's a man and a man has to try
Let him run, let him fall, let him cry
His world won't fall apart
If you take him into your heart

My father married a Cherokee
My mother's people were ashamed of me
The Indian's said that I was white by law
The white man always called me Indian Squaw

Let me hate the word
Half breed
She's no good they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born

We never settled went from town to town
When you're not welcome you don't hang around
The other children always laughed at me
Give her a feather, she's a Cherokee


We weren't accepted and I felt the shame
Fifteen I left and tell me whose to blame
My life since then has been from man to man
But I can't run away from what I am

Got my body crying the blues

Got a line I'm throwing to you

You're the mountain that I want to climb
I won't stop until I reach it this time
I just can't get you out of my mind

I'm all fired up with no where to burn
Got to hold myself steady
I'm all fired up with nowhere to burn
I know what I want and I'm ready

And you passed every test
You left me here starved and obsessed
With a hunger that begs for you
Draw, aim, fire
You can't run from my desire
It's my arrow through your heart surrender to me

And a comb up his sleeve—just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it

This friend of mine, he looks real good
He drives a fast car and lives in Hollywood
He treats me like his little sis
I got to let him know I want more than this
I want more
His girlfriend Jane is a prissy brat
I don't know what he sees in that
Think, she's cool in her short tight dress
Take away the glamour and she's just a mess

Do you ever think of me
As more than just a friend?
Ever, will this dream never end?

I got love eyes looking at you
I got a big heart made for two
Would you feel the same if you only knew
I got Love eyes looking at you?

I want to close my eyes and take a deep breath
I want to be strong but I'm scared to death
I want to put your arms around my waist
And tell you that I love you right to your face



This friend of mine, he looks real good
Guess who made it to Hollywood
No more Jane, I got her beat
Now I'm sitting pretty in the front seat
Have you ever looked at me
And felt the feeling of heaven
With the two of us in love?

How can you tell me it wasn't for real
Step into my shoes and see how it really feels
I know, I know, why you do it
But still I can't stand, you putting me through it

Don't give me that once over
That's just one step over the line

Once upon a time, I let you be free
There was no reason that I had to feel
I know, I know, easy for you to believe
But this time, it's better for me to give than receive


You made the place and time
Now did you think, I'd cry?
Once in awhile, I think of you
Maybe something old for something brand new
I know, I know, I know you'll be
Somewhere in the night looking for me
You can seek but you'll never find
Because you can't go back in time

I do swear that I'll always be there
I'd give anything and everything and I will always care
Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow
For better for worse, I will love you
With every beat of my heart

From this moment, life has begun

Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on
From this moment, I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love, I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

I give my hand to you with all my heart
I can't wait to live my life with you, I can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you

There is nothing I wouldn't give

And you're the answer to my prayers from up above

I just can't sleep so I get in my car and I drive
I'm on the 101 and I'm cruising by to 105
Got the radio cranked and the rhythm is coming alive

Got the wind in my face and I'm ready to take on the night
Not a worry in sight and the DJ is rocking me right
Things are starting to shake but hold on because I ain't going to break

Red light in the rear view mirror
(Well hey you, pull it over here)
He says miss just step away from the car
(Hands on your head move and you're dead)
But officer

The rhythm made me do it
The rhythm got me high
The rhythm made me do it
What can I say
The rhythm made me do it

He's walking real slow and I know he's checking me out
Officer please can you tell me what this is about
You're doing 105 and I'm lucky that you're still alive

He says baby get behind the wheel
I want to make your tires squeal
Hey baby, like to make some noise
Turn it on, turn it up





The rhythm made me do it
The rhythm got me high

And I can be late for a date—that's fine
But he'd better be on time
Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!"

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

Well, any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's looking better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He'd better say, "Mmmm, I like it like that, yeah"

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!"

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time

A little physical attraction
Romantic, old-fashioned charm
And a lot of love and tenderness
Is gonna get you into her arms

You gotta start from the heart
You'll see love is gonna play it's part

If you wanna get to know her (Know her)
Really get inside her mind
If you wanna move in closer (Closer)
Take it slow, yeah, take your time
You must start from the heart and then...
If you wanna touch her
Really wanna touch her
If you wanna touch her, ask!

Let me let you in on a secret
How to treat a woman right
If you're looking for a place in her heart
It ain't gonna happen
No, it ain't gonna happen

If you wanna get to know her
Oh, really get inside her mind
Deep down
If you wanna move in closer
Take it slow, yeah, take your time, no, no, no
If you wanna get to know her (Get to know her)
Really get inside her mind (Oh, really get inside her mind)
If you wanna move in closer (Move in closer, baby)
Take it slow, yeah, take your time
You must start from the heart
You'll see love is gonna play it's part
If you wanna touch her
Really wanna touch her
If you wanna touch her, ask!

[Song 149: Falling (Spotify Singles)]
1 ContributorFalling (Spotify Singles) Lyrics
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you don't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

You said you cared, and you miss me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you don't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again
Mmm, mmm

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you don't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

Oh, mmm

[Song 150: Ka-Ching! (Green “Country” Version)]
1 ContributorKa-Ching! (Green “Country” Version) Lyrics
Mmm, oh

We live in a greedy little world
That teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly
Then turn around and spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money that we don’t possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So we're shoppin' every Sunday at the mall

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearеst store

(Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
It’s such a bеautiful thing
Ka-ching! (Ka-ching!)
Lots of diamond rings (Ka-ching!)
The happiness it brings (Ka-ching!)
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

When you're broke, go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when you get bored

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

(Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching! (Ka-ching!)
Lots of diamond rings (Ka-ching!)
The happiness it brings (Ka-ching!)
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things
Let's swing

Dig deeper in your pocket
Ooh, yeah, ah
Come on, I know you've got it
Dig deeper in your wallet
Oh

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

(Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching! (Ka-ching!)
Lots of diamond rings (Ka-ching!)
The happiness it brings (Ka-ching!)
You’ll live like a king
With lots of money and things (Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
You’ll live like a king
With lots of money and things

Ka-ching!
