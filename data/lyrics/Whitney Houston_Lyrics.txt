Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will our memories survive? One I can hold on to

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love, I'll remember forever

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?
Don't walk away from me

Don't make me close one more door

Stay in my arms if you dare

Ah

Hey, yeah, ah

I wanna dance

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away

I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
The loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost to my senses
Spinnin' through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feelin' down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love

A few stolen moments is all that we shared
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I try to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said, "Be patient, just wait a little longer."
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready
Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah, I'm saving all my loving
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
For you, for you

[Song 13: The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)]
6 ContributorsThe Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire) Lyrics
(Ooh, yeah, ooh Lord)

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire (well)
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (Mmm)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe (Well)
Help to make the season bright (Mmm)
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
(Scats)
Do you know that Santa's on his way?
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
Everybody's mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeers really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
From kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas (scats)
Happy Chanukah
Happy Kwanzaa
Merry Christmas to
To all of you
Merry Christmas to everyone

29 ContributorsOne Moment in Time Lyrics“One Moment In Time” is a ballad written by Albert Hammond and John Bettis, produced by Narada Michael Walden and performed by Whitney Houston for the 1988 Summer Olympics.
Each day I live
I want to be
A day to give
The best of me
I'm only one
But not alone
My finest day
Is yet unknown
I broke my heart
Fought every gain
To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity, mm

I've lived to be
The very best
I want it all
No time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity, oh

You're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will be
I will be
I will be free, oh
I will be
I will be free

But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me
Ooh, baby

I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?

And I know that you still care for me, for me

You still care for me

He takes me down and rocks me slow

The nights we held on 'til the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?

We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you?

You never let it end

You're not coming back
And it finally hit me all at once
All at once
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone

All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once

All at once
I looked around and found that you were with another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once
All at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone

All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows

All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And it hurts me more than you know
All at once

Mmm, yeah

Lost touch with my soul
I had nowhere to turn, I had nowhere to go
Lost sight of my dream
Thought it would be the end of me, ah

I thought I'd never make it through
I had no hope to hold on to
I, I thought I would break

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled, but I did not crumble
I got through all the pain
I didn't know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour, my faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up, hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength, oh

Found hope in my heart
I found the light to light my way out of the dark
Found all that I need, here inside of me, oh

I thought I'd never find my way
I thought I'd never lift that weight
I thought I would break

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled, but I did not crumble
I got through all the pain
I didn't know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour, my faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up, hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength

There were so many times I wondered
How I'd get through the night
I thought I took all that I could take

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled, but I did not crumble
I got through all the pain
Oh, I didn't know my own strength
My faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up, I hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength, mm

I was not built to break, no, no
I got to know my own strength

13 ContributorsTry It On My Own Lyrics
I'm wiser now
I'm not the foolish girl you used to know
So long ago
I'm stronger now
I've learned from my mistakes which way to go
And I should know
I put myself aside to do it your way
But now I need to do it all alone

And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what, I'll keep it real, you know
Time for me to do it on my own
Yeah-yeah-yeah, mmm, yeah-yeah

It's over now
I can't go back to living through your eyes
Too many lies
And if you don't know by now
I can't go back to being someone else
Not anymore
I never had a chance to do things my way
So now it's time for me to take control

And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what, I'm gonna keep it real, you know
Time for me to do it (Oh)

I start again go back to one
I'm running things my way (My way)
Can't stop me now, I've just begun
Don't even think about it
There ain't no way about it
I'm taking names, the world is mine
Yes, I'm going to take my turn
It's time for me to finally stand alone, stand alone

I am not afraid to try it on my own
And I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what, I'm gonna keep it real, you know
It's time for me to do it, see, I'm not afraid
(I am not afraid) to try it on my own
And I don't care if I'm right or wrong

Yeah, on

Where do I go?
When there's nobody else to turn to
Who do I talk to?
When nobody wants to listen
Who do I lean on? Oh
When there is no foundation stable
I go to the rock
I know he is able, I go to the rock

I go to the rock of my salvation
I go to the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain
And the mountain he stands by me
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter I go to the rock

Where do I go, where do I go
When the storms of life are threatening
Who do I turn to when those winds of sorrow blow
And is there a refuge in the time of tribulation
Go to the rock, I know he is able
I go to the rock

I go the rock when I need a friend
I can go to the rock
I go to the rock when I need a shelter
You can go to the rock
I can go
I go to the rock
I can go to the rock
I can go, I can go to the rock
I can go when I need some shelter
When I need a friend
I can go

On Christ the solid rock I stand I can stand
When I need a friend
I go to the rock
I can go to the rock

To feel the way I do
But I will play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

How could I throw away a miracle?
How could I face another day?
It's all of my doing, I made a choice
And today, I pay
My heart is full of pain
How could you understand, the way I feel?
How could you relate to so much pain?
Seems as though nothing can comfort me
So today, I pray
That someone should listen, for

Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store

How could I let go of a miracle?
Nothing could ever take its place
Thought I was looking out for myself
Now it seems the pain
Is all that I have gained
I wonder if I could be your miracle
I wonder if I could spare you pain
Seems as though nothing will comfort me
Lord, less today, I pray
That you should come listen, for

Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you

Don't ever throw away your miracle
Don't let it slip away
Nothing should matter

Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store, for you

But this has never yet prevented me

Won a few more moments

Now at least I know, I know him well

Wasn't it good? (Wasn't it good?)
Wasn't it fine? (Wasn't it fine?)
Isn't it madness he can't be mine?
But in the end
He needs a little bit more than before
Security (He needs his fantasy and freedom)
I know him so well

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide
Looking back (Looking back)
I could have played it differently (Differently)
Learned about the man before I fell
But I was ever so much younger then
Now at least I know, I know him well

Wasn't it good? (Oh, so good)
Wasn't it fine? (So fine)
Isn't it madness he can't be mine?

Didn't I know how it would go
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart?

Wasn't it fine (Oh, wasn't it fine?)
Isn't it madness he can't be mine?

He needs his fantasy and freedom (I know him so well)

It took some to understand him

[Song 39: Who Would Imagine a King]
10 ContributorsWho Would Imagine a King Lyrics
Mommies and daddies always believe
That their little angels are special indeed
And you could grow up to be anything
But who would imagine a king?
A shepherd or teacher is what you could be
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea
Or maybe a carpenter building things
But who would imagine a king?
It was so clear when the wise men arrived
And the angels were singing your name
That the world would be different cause you were alive
That's why heaven stood still to proclaim

One day an angel said quietly
That soon he would bring something special to me
And of all of the wonderful gifts he could bring

Who would imagine?
Who could imagine?
Who would imagine a king?
Mmm hmm

Like a candle burning bright

A flame to light our way
That burns brighter everyday
But now I have you
Nobody loves me like you do

Like a leaf upon the wind
I could find no place to land
I dreamed the hours away
And wondered every day
Do dreams come true?
And nobody loves me like you do

What if I'd never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
Ooh, you've touched my heart in places that I never even knew
'Cause nobody loves me like you do

I was words without a tune
I was a song still unsung
A poem with no rhyme
A dancer out of time
But now there's you
Babe, nobody loves me like you do

What if I'd never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow, ooh

Oh joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh, joy, joy, joy in my soul

Listen to the music
The sound of the angels
Come and see the child
Who can make you whole
Lying in a manger
Away from harm and danger

Oh joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh joy, joy, joy in my soul
Joy, joy, joy in my soul oh

He sent from up above
This special gift of love
More precious than silver or gold
He was sent this holiday
To take our pain away

Oh joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh joy, joy, joy in my soul
Joy, joy, joy in my soul oh

Go tell it on the mountain
Shout it from a valley
Tell about the baby in swaddling clothes
Men in every nation
Join the celebration

Way down deep joy
Joy, joy, joy
I've got joy
Way down deep inside my soul joy
Unspeakable joy
Joy in my soul

Uhm, hey, Deb
Mhm
Thank you for being woman enough to come
Whitney, what's this about?

I know he's leaving me for you
Who said that? Who told you that is true?
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
He told me that he loved me
I heard that
He told me I was beautiful
How did you know? How did you know?
'Cause I've played that scene before

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now, the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
I'm not hating
But I wish the one before me would have warned me too, babe
Ooh, don't say no more (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Uncover your ears, girl
I'm not listening (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
But I know you hear me
Maybe my reasons are wrong, but I know that you believe me

This is a retake of my life (This is a retake of my life)
I was his star for many nights (Star for many, many, many, many nights)
Now, the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights (Lights), camera, now you're on (Camera, now you're on)
Just remember you've been warned (Remember you've been warned)
Enjoy it now, 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

It's your fault you didn't love him enough
That's the problem, I loved him too much
And when you love him, he becomes unattracted to you
Oh no, he's changed and I'll prove you wrong
No, you won't
So go away, leave us the hell alone, 'cause he loves me
He'll hurt you
He'll stay with me
He'll leave you
For sure, for sure

This is a retake of my life (A retake of my life; Yes, it is)
I was his star for many, many nights (Star for many, many, many, many nights)
Now, the roles have changed (Now, na-na-na-na-na-now, now, the roles have changed)
And I'm the leading lady in his life
Lights (Lights), camera, now you're on (Camera, now you're on)
Just remember you've been warned (You've been warned)
Enjoy it now, because it won't last, no
Same script, different cast
This is a retake of your life
You were his star for many, many nights
But now, the roles have changed
I'm the leading lady in his life
Lights (Lights), camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, 'cause this will last
I'm the future, you're his past
This is a retake of my life (The past, oh)
I was his star for many nights (Oh, oh)
Now, the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned (Remember you've been warned)
Enjoy it now, just you watch us now
It won't last, I know it will last

One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last

Now Romeo, you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right, next time
That's the end of me

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
(No, no, no, no, no, get it right)

Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same

Now Romeo, you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time
Say good-bye to me, boy

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say (You better watch what you say, boy)
If you still need her
Then be on your way (Be on your way, yeah)

So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan, oh

I never wanna be the girly that you "call" one and only
You know the kind of girl
That you would call when you get lonely
I never should have let you in
A damn shame
Forgot my name!
Well, anyway

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her (Need her)
Then be on your way (Boy, don't you be on your way)
Don't want to hear about Susan

Ooh, oh
Ooh, hey, baby
I'm living for you

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be than with you
Loving you
Day will make the way for night
All we need is candlelight
And a song, soft and long

Well, glad to be
Here alone with a lover unlike no other
Sad to see
A new horizon slowly coming into view

I wanna be living for the love of you
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
You, you, you

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me when the morning comes
Feels good to me
My love and me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Smoother then a gentle breeze
Flowing from my mind with ease
Soft as can be
Well, when you're loving me, ooh, ooh, baby

Love to be
Riding the waves of love, enchanted with your touch
It seems to me
We can sail together in and out of mystery

I wanna be living for the love of you, baby, baby
All that I'm giving, giving is for the love of you
You, you, you

Paradise, I have within
Can't feel as secure again
You're the key
And this I see, yeah, ooh
Now and then I lose my way
Using words to try and say what I feel
Oh yeah, your love is real, ooh

I might as well
Sign my name on a card that could say it better
See, time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do
Do, do

I wanna be living for the love of you
(Living for you, only for you, boy)
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
(My love for you, baby)
I wanna be living for the love of you
(I, I, I, baby)
All that I'm giving, giving is for the love of you
(For the love of you, better believe it, boy)
I wanna be living for the love of you
(Of you, of you, of you, of you, wanna be giving, giving, giving)
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
(All my love to you, to you, you)
I wanna be living for the love of you
(I wanna be living, I wanna be living)

All that I'm giving is for the love of you

Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart one more time? Oh, no, no
Did you think that I'd still care
That there'd be more feeling there?
Did you think you could walk back in my life? Oh
So you found you miss the love you threw away, uh
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry (To cry)
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you (Oh, baby, now)
I learned from you

I remember cold nights
And tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye, baby
Would've sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you are the last thing on my mind, mm
Now you say you're sorry and you've changed your ways
Sorry, but you changed your ways too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry (To cry)

When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you who said goodbye
Who said goodbye


And so you know the way it feels to cry (You know the way it feels to cry)
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two (Broke my world in)
And baby, I learned the way to break a heart (I learned the way, I learned the way to break a heart)

For you and I, boy
And believe me, it's confusing me
I'm afraid to say "Let's make up" and all's forgiven
But something tells me I'm headed for heartbreak
So darling, please, I'm praying that
This time, yeah, this time will be different
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize

Tell me, are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it just the lonely talking again?
Are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it the lonely talking again? (Lonely talking again)

Now, the time before
When we got together
You promised you'd be forever true to me
But all I got from you
Was lots and lots of talking
Lonely nights filled with misery

So baby, please, please tell me now
That when I fulfill your needs
You won't up and leave me
Even though you know I'll let you come back

Tell me, are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it just the lonely talking again?
Are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it the lonely talking again? (Lonely talking again)

9 ContributorsOne of Those Days Lyrics
Na na, na na na na
Come on, uh
Come on, uh
Come on, oh
Whoa, Lord
This is just for me, ooh, mmm
Na na na na, na na na na

Kicked off my shoes and relaxed my feet
Hit the kitchen, grabbed a bite to eat
Now, it's been one of those crazy weeks
And I gotta do something special for me
See, hit the salon, get a mani and a pedi
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Gotta take time out, time out
And all my real ladies know what I'm talking about, sing

Ooh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now
Ooh, baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful, oh yeah

Tonight, it's all about me
Just wanna set my body free
Never mind the TV
Tonight, I'll just let a little TV watch me
Light the candles, aroma therapy
Hot tub bubbles surrounding me
Mr. Big is in the background
The Isley Brothers gonna hold it down, sing

Ooh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it for me, oh
Ooh, baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful
One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful, oh yeah

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
I need one of those days
You don't know how
Ooh, ooh, ooh

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

And darker than the darkest night
Bigger than the biggest gun
Because he's the only shining sun camon

Who made the mountains
Who made the trees
Who made the rivers that flow out to the seas
And who hung the moon in the starry, starry, starry sky

Somebody bigger
I know I know he's bigger than you and I
My God is bigger
Somebody bigger
He's bigger, he's bigger than you
He's bigger than you

And who writes the songs for the robins to sing uh
And who sends the rain when the Earth is dry
I know, I know, I know
Somebody bigger yeah
Than you and I
Somebody bigger than you and I
Bigger than you and I

He lights the way when road is alone
Keeps me company with love to guide you
He walks beside you just like he walks with me
When I am weary, and filled with despair
Who gives me courage to go on and on and on from there
And who gives me faith
I will never, never, never, never, never doubt
Somebody bigger yeah
Somebody bigger than me and you
Bigger than you and I
Somebody bigger
My Lord is bigger than you
Bigger than you and I

He lights the way when the road is long
Keeps you company with love to guide you
He walks beside you just like he walks with me

Bigger than the deepest sea
Somebody deeper than the desert sands
Bigger than the tallest man
And phatter than the phattest phat
Bigger than the Shaq attack

We all wanna make a place in this world
We all want to our voices to be heard
Every one wants a chance to be someone
We all have dreams we need to dream
Sweeter than any star you can reach
Because when you reach and find, you've found someone
You'll hold this world's most priceless thing
The greatest gift this life can bring
Is when you look back and know
You were loved

You were loved by someone
Touched by someone
Held by someone
Meant something to someone
Loved somebody
Touched somebody's heart
Along the way
You can look back and say (Mmm)
You were loved (Yes, you were)

You can have diamonds in your hands
Have all the riches in the land
But, without love
You don't really have a thing, no no
When somebody cares that you're alive
When somebody trusts you with their life
That's when you'll know (Huh)
That you have all you need
You'll hold this world's most priceless gift
The finest treasure that there is
You can look back and know
You were loved

You were loved by someone
Touched by someone
Held by someone
Meant something to someone
Loved somebody
Touched somebody's heart
Along the way
You can look back and say (Mmm)
Yes, You were loved (Yes, you were now)

So many roads that you can take
Whatever way you go
Don't take that road alone
It's better you should know

You were loved by someone
Touched by someone
Held by someone
Meant something to someone
Loved somebody
Touched somebody's heart
Along the way
You can look back and say (Mmm)
You did okay
You were loved

So remember to tell that special one (Yeah, mmm)
You were loved
You were loved
You were loved
You were loved
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now
You've come along

And fill my nights with song

Rolling at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey
I love you
Never again to be all alone

To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

Today I did some shopping
Just had to clear my mind again

Hopped into a taxi
And in a moment I was home
Home again

But as I turned the page (Ooh), and stepped inside (Inside)

I'm gonna catch the next plane out (Next plane out)

When you find your heart a home

I've seen it in the movies
Read about it in a book

But your touch was all it took

But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

Come and make your magic (Mm)
'Til you have me hypnotized (Ooh)
If we get any closer
I'll be drowning in your eyes (Ooh)

When my love was on the line
I'm so glad you gave me yours
When I gave you mine

So take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart

We didn't know, we didn't know

Since I don't know when
We've been only friends
No more, but no less
Our friendship we had at best
A voice to console
An ear to confide
That someone you tell
Your deepest of feelings inside

But we didn't know (We didn't know, we didn't know)
When we held each other
It would feel so right
We didn't know (We didn't know, we didn't know)
On that night we'd be falling in love
I looked at you
You looked at me
In ways we never thought we would be
But like tomorrow's today's mystery
We didn't know
Oh yeah
We didn't know, we didn't know
We didn't know, we didn't know

Be it big, be it small
On you I could call
Nothing but to ask
You'd be right there in a flash
A hand I could hold
That friend I could trust
But the love that we shared
Was just platonic between us

'Cause we didn't know (We didn't know, we didn't know)
When we held each other
It would feel so right
We didn't know (We didn't know, we didn't know)
On that night we'd be falling in love
I looked at you
You looked at me
In ways we never thought we would be
But just like tomorrow's today's mystery
We didn't know

That's what happens
When innocent friends
Turn serious lovers
And we're so happy that
We've fallen in love
And still can be best of friends, yeah
Ooh

Best of friends (Best)
Or more
We didn't know, we didn't know

When they'd break your heart
And when they'd make you cry
We both would confer
You should give love one more try
We've searched everywhere
For true love to find
Yet who'd think it was us
That we were longing for all the time?

'Cause we didn't know (We didn't know, we didn't know)
Ooh no, when we held each other
It would feel so right
We didn't know (We didn't know, we didn't know)
Oh no no
On that night we'd be falling in love
I looked at you
And you looked at me
In ways we never thought we would be
But just like the future
No one can see
We didn't know

Oh, we didn't know (We didn't know, we didn't know, didn't know)
When we held each other
It would feel so right
We didn't know (We didn't know, we didn't know) oh no baby
On that night we'd be falling in love
I looked at you
And you looked at me
In ways we never, ever thought that we could be
But like tomorrow's today's mystery
We didn't know

We didn't know, we didn't know
We didn't know, we didn't know

[Song 65: A Song for You]
7 ContributorsA Song for You Lyrics
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs and made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my live on stages with ten thousand people watching
Well, we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

I know your image of me is what I hoped to be
I've treated you unkindly, but darling, can't you see?
There's no one more important to me?
Baby, can't you see through me?
We're alone now, and I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets of a true love withholding nothing
(Withholding nothing)
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now I'm so much better, and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody (The melody) 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time (Space or time)
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, oh, remember when we were together
(We were together)
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

This song is for you (This song, this song)
This song is for you (This song, this song)
This song is for you (This song, this song)
This song is for you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you

I love you in a place, my dear friend
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, ah, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone (We were alone) and I was singing this song to you

We were alone, and I was singing this song to you
We were alone (Yeah, yeah), and I was singing this song
Oh yeah, singing this song (Singing this song)
I was singing this song, just for you

On the day that you left me
You said you had no regrets
There's a bond between us
That hasn't been broken yet
And the feelings between us
Will never disappear
How can you be far away
When your spirit's here?

You're still my man
Nothing can change it
We still belong together

Nothing can change it
Our love will last forever

And the seasons of our love
Will always change, I know
Maybe that's the reason
You felt you had to go
But soon you'll be missing me
Darling, I know you well
There's a magic we share together
And no one can break that spell

You're still my man
Nothing can change it
We still belong together

I've been waiting such a long time
For a love that's real to come my way
Going to take some getting used to
Now that love is here to stay

After we make love
I'll be lost in the afterglow
You're all I'm dreaming of
I just can't, I just can't let the feeling go
After we make love
There's no doubt in my mind I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow
All that matters is right here and now

Now the world is filled with wonder
You turned my life around in just one day
I love the spell you put me under
With just one kiss you take my breath away

After we make love
Feels so good to be lost in the afterglow
You're all I'm dreaming of

Because of all the things they've heard (Things they've heard)
They think they're got to close their hearts
Can't see the light, the soul in the dark
But I know I got a real good man
Who loves me the best as he can (Best as he can)
That's why I'm here faithfully
'cause you'll do the same for me, oh now

See, my love is like an open sky
See, my heart is like a river wide

And sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you've got me
You can trust in my love

The fire (The pain)
The rain (The joy)
Take the joy and do it in pain

Don't give up (Don't give up)
They can try but it will never never break my love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
See my love

See, my love is like an open sky (Open sky)
See my heart is like a river wide (River wide)

Someone for me

I'm here alone on a Friday night
Waiting here beside the phone
The TV, radio and me
Really ain't been getting along
Mm, I wish that I could fly away
Party 'til the break of day
And there I'd be sure to meet
The guy that would be special to me
Then momma comes and asks me
Why I am dreaming, sitting alone?
Why not go out and have some fun?
It's the only way I'll ever find someone for me
While I am young and seventeen

Someone for me (Someone for me)
I've got to find someone

I've got to find someone, yeah (Ooh)

With people packed against the walls (Mm)

Trying to make sense of it all
And when I least expect it
Meeting the guy I see in my dreams (Ooh)
Here he is walking up to me
And asking if I'd like to come and dance with him
I think I found someone for me

Someone for me (Someone for me)
I've got to find someone

I need somebody for me

And happiness can come to you and me

It's fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine
It's alright

Had a dream last night
That the world stopped turning
But your madness, it kept on
Guess I wasn't too bright
And I really wasn't learning
Should have seen it all along, ah

All those sweet, sweet kisses and those sweet red roses
They convinced me that it was you
I made you exclusive
Now it's so conclusive
That you wasn't doing it too

If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine (It would have been fine)
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time (Would've had a good time)
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine (I would've been fine)
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time

Something didn't feel right
And I wish I knew it
I just could not see your games
I got respect for you
And you put me through it
Why would you bring me so much pain?

I would still love for you 'cause I did adore you
While my dogs would chew you out
Tried to be so nice on those lonely nights
But I should have figured you out

If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine (It would have been fine, boy)
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time (I would've had a good time now)
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around
It would have been fine (I would've been, ooh, baby)
Then I would have played too
And I guess I would have had a good time

Baby, you're so fine (You are the one that I love)
You are so fine (Your love was sent from above)
You're so fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine
So doggone fine
Baby, you're so fine (You are the one that I love)
You are so fine, oh, you're on my mind
You're fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine
Fine (You are the one that I love)
Fine (Your love was sent from above)
You're fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine

Since you've been away
I've been down and lonely
Since you've been away
I've been thinking of you
Trying to understand
The reason you left me
What were you going through?

Ooh, ooh - I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh, ooh - I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

As I look around
I see things that remind me
Just to see you smile
Made my heart fill with joy
I'll still recall
All those dreams we shared together
Where did you run to, boy?

Ooh, ooh - I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh, ooh - I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

Sometimes I've wondered
I didn't understand
Just where you were trying to go
Only you knew the plan
And I tried to be there
But you wouldn't let me in
But now you've gone away, boy
I feel so broken hearted
I knew the day we started
That we were meant to be
If only you'd let me
I've cried so many tears
Gotta face now all my fears
We let time slip away
I need you boy here today!

There was so much you gave me
To my heart, to my soul
There was so much of your dreams
That were never told
You had so much hope
For a brighter day
Why were you my flower
Plucked away

I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Tell me why the road turns
Tell me why the road turns
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love I'll remember forever

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me, no
Don't walk away from me

Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh you

Friday night, you and your boys went out to eat, oh
Then they hung out
But you came home around three - yes, you did
If six of y'all went out, ah
Then four of you were really cheap, yeah
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah

Ah, ah, ah, yeah, ah

I'll pack a bag so you can leave town for a week - yes, I am
The phone rings, and then you look at me
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 213 show up on your Caller I.D.? Oh

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah

I've been through all of this before
I've been through all this before
So how could you think
Don't think about it, don't think about it
That I would stand around and take some more?
Get gone, get gone
Things are gonna change
Things are gon' change, baby
'Cause I don't wanna be a fool anymore
You don't stand no chance, boy
That's why you have to leave
Said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So don't turn around to see my face
Don't you turn around
There's no more tears left here for you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that? (Tell me, boy)
Was it really worth you going out like that?
See, I'm movin' on
And I refuse to turn back, yeah
See, all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out, you were making a fool of me, oh

It's not right, but it's okay
It's not right, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, ah
Pack your bags, up and leave
Close the door, and leave your key
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, oh

It's not right, it's okay, baby
I'm gonna make it anyway

When your love is strong and it comes from the heart
Ain't no man strong enough
Ain't no time long enough to tear it apart
And that's what we had, believe it or not
So on the final day I thought all the hurting pain will end up on top
So I won't cry 'cause you're goin' away
'Cause the chemistry we've got, it don't fade
I won't be wishing for better days
'Cause deep, inside I know our love stays the same

You gotta know
No matter where you are (You got me)
Baby, near or far (You got me)
Our love will never fade (You got me)
So let me hear you say it
Baby, I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there (No matter what)
Baby, I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there, there (No matter what)
'Cause I got you, baby, yeah

I never lie
'Cause you are the reason that my heart is beating, and I am alive
Before you go, thinking that I can't be replaced, no
I got you waiting for the rest of my life (Oh, you gotta know)

No matter where you are (You got me)
Baby, near or far (You got me)
Our love will never fade (You got me)
So let me hear you say it
Baby, I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there (Oh, no matter what)

Baby, I got you, I'll be there, I'll be there  (No matter what)
I'll be there, I'll be there, there(No matter what)
'Cause I got you, baby, yeah

I'll hold you up (When you just can't stand)
I'll make you cry (When you think that you can't)
By my side forever (Baby, that's the plan)
I'll be your everything, I'll be your everything, oh (I got you)
Whoa, oh

No matter where you are (You got me)

Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there for me
Oh what's the sense of trying hard
To find your dreams
Without someone to share it with
Tell me what does it all mean

I want to run to you
I want to run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away

I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart, in my heart you'd find
Oh a girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me
Oh I feel so all alone

I want to run to you
I want to run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away
Run away

I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears
If you only knew how much

I want to run to you
I want to run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away

With your crew and their schemes
Remembering back in the day
I used to mean everything

Your boys to control, darling

Who would've thought of it
That I might feel like this?
Some kind of wonderful
There's nothing quite comparable
The thing about it is
It's oh so innocent
I wasn't looking for
It came knocking at my door
I'm trying to do things right
But I'm about to lose this fight
Because spending time with you
Well, it feels so good and that's the truth

And every day with you
I swear it brings me closer
To my only reservation is you
My sweet temptation, baby

Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you
Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you

Who could imagine it
I found my happiness
In someone I barely know
And I like to take it slow
But you're so different, boy
You're breaking all my rules
What is it in your smile
That makes me feel the way I do
I'm trying to live my life
And I'm trying to live it right
If I desire you
It ain't because I'm trying to

Boy, every day with you
Well, I swear it brings me closer to
My only reservation is you
My sweet temptation, baby

Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you
Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you

I've given it consideration uh huh
And it all adds up to you
I won't deny this heart is calling for you, baby
I've given it a lot of thought uh huh
And it all ends up on you

12 ContributorsI Was Made to Love Him Lyrics
Hey, oh, hey, hey, hey
See, I was born in Newark (sure was)

We were always hand in hand
He wore high top shoes and shirt tales
Nip wore her pigtails
I knew I loved him even then
You know some disapproved it
They even boo-hooed it
But I told them time and time and time again
You know I was made to love him
Build my world around him and
Hey, hey, hey
He’s been my inspiration
Sho’ nuff appeciation
For the love I gave him through the years

Like a sweet magnolia trea
My love blossomed tenderly
My love grew sweeter through the years

I know my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That’s why we made it through the years
I was made to love him
Worship and adore him, yes say
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, oh Lord

All through thick and thin
Our love just won’t end
But I love my baby, love my baby, oh

My baby loves me
My baby needs me
I know I ain’t going nowhere
I was just a little thing
The love bug hit me
I had the fever with each passing year

If all should tumble
And the whole world crumble
By his side I’ll still be standing, yeah

Because I was made to love him
Made meant for him, say
Hey, hey, hey
I was made to love him
Build my world all around him say
Hey, hey, hey

I love my baby
Nip ain't’ going nowhere
Say hey, hey, hey

[Song 89: Family First]
2 ContributorsFamily First Lyrics
Nothing's better than family
For the ones who love you so
Be a shoulder to cry on when you're in need
They'll never leave you alone, no
When your friends bring you down
And they drag you through the dirt
And when nobody's around
They'll carry you through the hurt
Just remember that family comes first

Where you gonna run to (Where you gonna run)
When no one is around (No one is around)
Do you think out there they'll love you
When your face is on the ground? (Face is on the ground)
When you feel your strength is almost gone (Almost gone)
And your arms are getting weak (And you're getting weak)
And you don't think you'll keep holding on (Hold on)
We'll help you stand tall on your feet (Just remember)
Family comes first

I can see you crying - someone broke your heart
Instead of being with those who love you, you spend time apart
It's because you think they won't understand
The pain you're going through
So you don't reach out your hand for them
'Til they'll pull and reach for you
Just remember (Remember) that family comes first

Where you gonna run to when no one is around?
(Where you gonna run?)
Do you think out there they'll love you
When your face is on the ground? (You know that we love you)
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And your arms are getting weak (Ooh)
And you don't think you'll keep holding on
We'll help you stand tall on your feet

Don't you be ashamed of your family
Brought you into this earth, and loved you since birth
(Untraditionally, yeah, oh yeah)
Sometimes you may disagree and won't see eye to eye
Don't you run away, oh no
They'll be right by your side, oh oh, oh oh

Where you gonna run to (Who you gonna run to?)
When no one is around? (When no one is around)
Do you think out there they'll love you
When your face is on the ground? (Oh, oh yeah)
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And your arms are getting weak (Your arms are getting weak)
And you don't think you'll keep holding on
We'll help you stand tall on your feet
(We'll help you stand) (Just remember) (Just remember)
Family comes first, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Ooh, babe

I believe that we will be
In love eternally
Well, as far as I can see
You will always be the one for me
Oh, yes, you will

And I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea, I was lost

I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down, baby
Said I will always be around
Just to be right where you are, my love
You know I love you, boy

Maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
But I will play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

And yes, baby, you're my dream come true

I would get to where I got to
Had one angel to guide me
Some who just violated my love
Now this is my chance to say, ain't got nothin' but love

For my family that raised me (Shout out, shout out)
And my teacher that done praised me (Shout out, shout out)
To anyone who tried to hate on me, yeah (Shout out, shout out)

Even the one's who tried to take me down

Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya

I could hold on to pain, but that ain't what my life's about
I ain't blaming nobody if I ain't got my stuff worked out
I got a love for my self, ain't gonna regret anything I've done
I just wanna sing my song, ain't got nothin' but love

For all the players on the street (Shout out, shout out)
To all my ghettos doing y'all thing (Keep on, keep strong)
To all my exes that done wrong me (Shout out, shout out)
Stepped on me, can't hold me down, oh

Putting her daughter's mouth before her own

4 ContributorsI Will Always Love You (Alternate Mix) Lyrics
I'd like to do a song that I've never sung before
You know, when I first heard this song, it made me feel very sad
But it doesn't anymore
Now it just reminds me of someone very special
And this is for him...

If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you
You
My darling, you

Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye, please don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need

And I will always love you
I will always love you
You


I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I, I will always love you

I'll always love you

8 ContributorsLove That Man Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Things just ain't the way that they used to be
Back in the day when a man meant security
After working hard all week
Baby kick back and throw up your feet
Let me fix you a treat
So it might be a little bit sweet
But he's worth it
He deserves it (Uh-huh)
He may not be perfect
But he's all the man I need
He's ready and willing
Gives me the feeling (Ah)
And whenever we're together
I know I'm where I belong

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man, yeah
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (He's always, always there)
Don't you love that man? (I know)

Things ain't the way they used to be, ah
When a woman and a man work hard to be
Happy in love and staying together, ooh
(Let's stay that way forever)
When you get into a fight
Just try and work it out
Never give up on him
That's not what love's about
Stay true to your feelings
And remember
All the things he's done for you

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (He's always, always there)
Don't you love that man? (I know)
It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man, oh
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man, ah
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares (I do, ah, I do, ah)
And he's always there (He's always always there)
Don't you love that man? (I know)

You'd better know I'm talking about that old-school love
That everlasting feeling can't never be too much, ah
Somebody loves you, heart and soul
Hold on (Hold on), don't stop (Don't stop)
And never let him go (And never let him go)

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man, I do
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (Always, always there)
Don't you love that man? (I know)
It's just the way he looks into your eyes
But I do, I do
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
I love that man
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (He's always there)
Don't you love that man? (I love my man)
It's just the way he looks into your eyes

[Song 96: Anymore]
7 ContributorsAnymore Lyrics
I believe in roses, but only from the heart
And if it's not sincere, baby, then I don't want no part
I believe in one love, baby, true monogamy
What I don't know can't hurt me, well, that's not the way I see
If you believed in me, you wouldn't mess around
It's not like I don't know you've been with every girl in town
You got a lot of nerve to think I just close my eyes
While you walk around so full of it, I give you my surprise

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no
I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no

I believe that angels watch everything we do
And all the wrong you're doing just might come back on you
I believe in phone calls when you're not by my side
Especially when it's lonely in the middle of the night
If you believe that true love is only made in bed
Lord, have mercy on you, chivalry is dead
You got a lot of nerve to think, to think that I'm still down
While you've taken me for granted, boy, I'm through, I'm outta town

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore, no
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no
I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore, no more
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no, baby

So baby, you can kiss this girl goodbye (Kiss this girl goodbye)
I'm through with you, moving on with my life
No more pain, babe, no more fears
I'm moving on, I'm keeping on, I'm through with all the tears

Your kinda love, your kinda trust
I don't want you (Don't want you, don't need you, can't have you)
Don't want you, don't need you
Can't have you
Your kinda kisses, to be your Mrs
I don't want you

I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no (I don't need you)
I don't need your kinda love, I don't need your kinda trust
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your kinda kisses, I don't want to be your Mrs
I don't want you anymore, no

I don't need, don't want you
Don't need, don't want
Don't need that kind of love
Don't want your kind of love
I don't need, don't want you
Don't need, don't want
Don't need that kind of love
Don't want your kind of love
Don't need it
Don't want it
Don't need it
Don't want it
Don't need it
Don't need it
Don't want you, don't need you

8 ContributorsTell Me No Lyrics
Reaching for my dreams
And you're so quick to say what I can't do
You criticize my actions
But I don't see you standing in my shoes
I'm going the wrong way, I'm doing the wrong things
Every word just gives me fuel
So come on come on come on come on come on come on

And tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
I dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
So come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go
Tell me no

For every step I take you're right there
Trying to block my next move
If you're making me feel bad
Then tell me then do you feel good
I'm just human and all I'm doing
That's what my heart tells me I should
So come on come on come on come on come on come on

And tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
I dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
So come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go
Tell me no

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
It motivates me more and more
And I think it's time you know
Giving me something to work for
And I can't wait for the day
I can rub things in your face
And I ain't gon' stop 'til I'm done
I reach the top, I'm the number one
For every time you try and tell me no
For every time you try and tell me no
Oh, it makes me keep on keeping on

Tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
And I dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
So come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go

Ah, ah
Uh, yeah
Baby, ooh, yeah

We've been playing games with our emotions
Let's get what we feel out in the open

Wanting you is all I do
Boy, I know you want me too
Don't you think it's time we proved
What we've been feeling?

This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose
This love
Let's trust the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real
Soon enough
Let out your feelings tonight
'Cause, oh, I know that I want you
It's all up to me and you
And the moment of truth

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Far too many times, a heart gets broken
Just because three words are never spoken

We can't let that bother us
Not when we're so much in love
I could never get enough of saying I love you

This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose
This love
Let's trust the way that we feel

The first Noël, the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields they lay
In fields where they lay tending their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the Earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night, woah

Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël
Born is the King of Israel

Jesus (Oh, yeah) Christ is
Born is the King of Israel (Oh)

The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth (Oh yes it is now)
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Until he appeared
And the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angels' voices
Oh night divine
Oh, oh night when Christ was born
Oh night
Oh holy, holy night

I'm tired of playing this game
And I won't play it no more
And I won't take it no more
Through with being your fool
And I won't do it no more
And I won't, I won't keep up this act
Not for one minute
I'm gonna pull
I'm gonna pull this curtain down, no

This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change
And I (Mm) bow out (I won't be hanging 'round, baby)
I decline to take the pain
And I resign the masquerade
And I (I) bow out (I won't be staying 'round, baby)
I (I) bow (I bow) out

Can't go on with the show
You're just a stage I went through
Now you're just fading from view, yeah, babe

Guess I'll be taking my leave
I guess I won't, I won't stay in this play
Not for one minute
I'm gonna make

When you're left standing on that stage all alone
Maybe you will realize
You should've learned to treat me right
And when this final act is finally through
Maybe you'll wish you'd been
The kind of man you should have been
Now watch me say goodbye
And walk right out of your life
Oh, baby, alright, babe

This time I won't play this game (This time)
I made a vow to make a change (This time I made up my mind)
And I (I) bow  out (I bow, I won't be hanging 'round, baby)
I decline to take the pain (I decline, boy)
And I resign the masquerade (No more stayin' out)
And I bow out (Gonna bow out)
I won't be staying 'round, baby
This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change (Oh, said I)
And I bow out (I gotta, I gotta bow out, do you believe it?)
I decline to take the pain (I need you to hear me)
And I resign the masquerade (Do you hear me, baby?)
And I bow out (Mm, I won't be staying 'round, baby)
This time I won't play this game (Hey)
I made a vow to make a change (ooh)

[Song 106: Dear John Letter]
4 ContributorsDear John Letter Lyrics
I'm sitting here
In my own head thinking
How you could be staring in
Got my number two
And I'm writing you
Contemplating on the paper what I should do
On the fireplace, with the mail man
Should I tell you or should I hold it in
If my heart wasn't in it
Baby you could just forget it
I'd be gone in a New York minute

You never give me attention
I know you never had bad intentions for us
So I'm writing you
But I always fail to mention
Cause you know I really don't like to fuss
So I'm gonna hold it in

I'm writing you Dear John
I tried to stay but it never got better
I couldn't tell you face to face but I
I had to let you know
Sometimes I want to hit the door
I'm writing you Dear John

Sometimes I think that I've had enough
My hands freeze and I can't write fast enough
I want to get away but I can't obey when my heart speaks
You know I'm listening
Some days I'm really touchy and
Some days I'm willing to forget and
Some days I'm still in love with you
Some days I'm sad and blue

When I don't check myself
I get frustrated with you
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I know that it's not just you
It's some of my negligence too
And I can't go through with mailing this to you

Dear John letter
I tried to stay but it never got better
I couldn't tell you face to face but I
I had to let you know
Sometimes I want to hit the door
I'm writing you a Dear John letter

Got lost on his way

Smile on Christmas day, oh

Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years
We all will be together

Upon the highest bough ooh ooh
And have yourself
Let your heart be light

This way about his love

I'm takin' a chance
Haha
We'll see, we'll see (Woo)

There's a chance that maybe in this life I'll find
True love and peace of mind
There's a chance that maybe I can reach my goal
And soar to the other side
Good things come to those who wait
I'm just afraid that I might sit here and wait too late, so

I'm takin' a chance on loving you
And no matter the price, I'll pay my dues
Oh, I'm takin' a chance on loving you
They tell me I'm crazy (I'm crazy)

There's a chance that maybe once I could be wrong
But wrong never felt so right
There's a chance that maybe I'm risking much too soon
But our hearts just fell in tune
Good things come to those who wait
I'm just afraid that I might sit here and wait too late, so

I'm takin' a chance on loving you
No matter the price, I'll pay my dues
I'm taking a chance on loving you

I don't know much about you
But I know I can't live without you
(I'm takin' a chance, oh yeah)
I am telling all my friends goodbye
My friends can't understand but
I know I've got to try
Here's my reason why
I'm in love, that's all I know (I know)

I'm takin' a chance on loving you
No matter the price, I'll pay my dues (I'll pay my dues)
I'm takin' a chance on loving you
They tell me I'm crazy, it's true
They tell me I'm crazy

Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away

And I wind up feelin' down

On a love that burns hot enough to last

If I changed my mind
If I changed my faith
Every time a stop light signaled
Each time I made mistakes
I don't think that I
Would be where I am today
I live my life without regrets
What you see is
What you see is
What you see is what you get
And I'm

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
Of choices I've made
Of the love that I've saved
Of the things I've done
My belief in the One
Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are
Make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star
On my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

Adding up my life, it totals all my dreams
I'm counting all my blessings
And the gifts I have received
Still there's always someone
Something to overcome
Took all my life to understand
That I am what I am, who I am
Unashamed

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
Of choices I've made
Of the love that I've saved
Of the things I've done

Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are
Make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star
On my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

Do you
Do you want to know how it goes?
Do you want to control how I feel?
Do you want to stay in my life?
Then listen here, and listen good
You gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it right

Unashamed of the strength on my knees
Of choices I've made
Of the love that I've saved
Of the things I've done

Make mistakes, make amends

5 ContributorsSame Script, Different Cast  LyricsHey Deb
Uh huh
Thank you for being woman enough to come
Whitney, what's this about?
I know he's leaving me for you
Who said that, who told you that is true?
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
He told me that he loved me
I heard that
He told me I was beautiful
How did you know? How did you know?
'Cause I've played that scene before
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast
What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
I'm not hating but I wish the one before me
Would have warned me too, babe
Don't say no more la la la la la la la la la
Uncover you're ears girl
I'm not listening la la la la la la la la la
But I know you hear me
Maybe my reasons are wrong, but I know that you believe me
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast
It's your fault, you didn't love him enough
That's the problem I loved him too much
And when you love him, he becomes unattracted to you
Oh no, he's changing now he'll prove you wrong
No you won't
So go away, leave us the hell alone 'cause he loves me
He'll hurt you
He'll stay with me
He'll leave you for sure, for sure
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And I'm the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now because it won't last, no
Same script, different cast
This is a retake of your life
You were his star for many nights
But now the roles have changed
I'm the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now 'cause this will last
I'm the future, you're his past
This is a retake of life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life

[Song 130: I Learned from the Best (Radio Edit)]
2 ContributorsI Learned from the Best (Radio Edit) Lyrics
Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart one more time? Oh, no, no
Did you think that I'd still care
That there’d be more feeling there?
Did you think you could walk back in my life? Oh

So you found you miss the love you threw away, uh
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry (To cry)
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you (Oh, baby, now)
I learned from you

I remember cold nights
And tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye, baby
Would've sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you are the last thing on my mind, mmm

Now you say you're sorry and you’ve changed your ways
Sorry, but you changed your ways too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry (To cry)
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two (The way that I cried)
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart
(I know, I know the way to break a heart)
I learned from the best
I learned from you (Oh, baby, now, oh, baby, now)
I learned from you (Oh)

So when all you've got are sleepless nights
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you who said goodbye
Who said goodbye


And so you know the way it feels to cry
(You know the way it feels to cry)
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
(Broke my world in)
And baby, I learned the way to break a heart
(I learned the way, I learned the way to break a heart)
I learned from the best
I learned from you
Learned the way to break a heart (To break a heart)
I learned from the best
I learned from you

I learned from the best

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll livе as I believe
No mattеr what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity, my dignity

Dig-dig-dig-dig—, dignity

Because the greatest love of all

I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me

I know I may have made mistakes before
But now I understand what those mistakes were for Throughout my travels girl I realized
What you see, what you get don't always coincide
A bird in the hand beats two in a bush
But just one look was all it took
Could it be thayt we're the only ones thinking of
Harmony, ecstacy, there's something about this love
CHORUS: Bobby sings indented lines on the first chorus
We, we have something in common
Girl (Boy) you mean so much to me it should be plain to see That we... We have something in common
It's the way we feel about each other when we're together
VERSE 2: Sung by Whitney
Now I'm the type of girl who understands my man
I'll be strong when he's weak, I will hold his hand
Now I believe old fashioned rules and old fashioned ways Courtesy, honesty, like in the old days
You're my man and I'm your girl
There's nothing better in this whole wide world
I'll stand by your side till the very end
All in all, best of love, we are friends
CHORUS: with Whitney singing indented lines (see above)

Bobby: Girl you know it's you that I adore
Whitney: And there's no one in this world that I love more

This is the Heartbreak hotel

You said you'd be here by 9
Instead, you took your time
You didn't think to call me, boy
Here I sit, trying not to cry
Asking myself why you do this to me, mmm, now, baby

Since you're not around for me
To tell you, baby, face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? (What'd you do?)
Look what you did to me (Ah baby)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right (Do me right)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry (Made me cry)
What'd you do to me?
Can't take what you did to me

Now I see, that you've been doing wrong
Played me all along and made a fool of me, baby, ah
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheating on me, baby
How could you do it to me?

Since you're not around for me
To tell you, baby, face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say, oh

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
(All you did was lie to me, baby)
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
(Can't believe what you did to me)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? (Why'd you do it?)
Can't take what you did to me
(You didn't have to do it to me, baby)

Why, why'd you do it?

Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me?

I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry

Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind

[Song 143: My Name is Not Susan (Power Radio Mix with Rap)]
2 ContributorsMy Name is Not Susan (Power Radio Mix with Rap) Lyrics
Well, anyway
My name is not Susan
Need her
Be on your merry little way (Susan)
No, no, no, no, got nothin' on me
Re— (Respect), receive

Susan's not my name, my name's not Susan
Check your train of thought or the vocabulary you're usin'
I'm not the one for you to be confusing with another
You can take that to the bank, and I'm not frontin' on you, brother
I'm an individual, my love is exclusive
The way you insult my intellect is just abusive
So, if my individuality you can't respect
Then honey, you can elsewhere to place your bet

(Susan)
(Get it right, get it right, get it right)
(Susan)
(Get it right, get it right, get it right)

One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last

Now Romeo you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right, next time
That's the end of me

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
And if you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about Susan
She's got nothin' on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan (No, no, no, no)
(Get it right)

Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same

Now Romeo you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time
Say goodbye to me, boy

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
(Better watch what you say, boy)
And if you still need her
Then be on your way
(No, no, no, no)
Don't wanna hear about Susan
(I don't wanna hear)
She's got nothin' on me
(She got nothin' on me)
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan

Oh, I never wanna be the girly that you call your one and only
You know the kind of girly you would call when you get lonely
I never should have let you in
A damn shame, forgot my name
Well, anyway

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
And if you still need her
Then be on your way
(Be on your merry little way)
Don't wanna hear about Susan
(No, no, no, no)
She's got nothin' on me
(She got nothin' on me)
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan

Now's the time for me to take a stand
Just to reassure you of the woman that I am
Being part of a comparison is just not my style
If we were to race, you know I'd win by miles
Susan this, Susan that, the conversation is tired
I'm the one that's loving you, why don't you try it
My name is not Susan, so watch what you say
And if you still need her, be on your merry, merry way

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
And if you still need her
Then be on your way
(Be on your merry little way)
Don't wanna hear about Susan
(No, no, no, no)
She's got nothin' on me
(She got nothin' on me)
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about Susan
She's got nothin' on me
So show some respect for the love you receive

My name is not Susan

[Song 144: How Will I Know (The Brit Awards)]
2 ContributorsHow Will I Know (The Brit Awards) Lyrics
There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?

Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if hе's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in lovе is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistakin'
What I feel is really love
Ooh, tell me

How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

If he loves me (Say you love me, say you love me)
If he loves me not
If he loves me  (Say you love me, say you love me, I know you do)
If he loves me not
If he loves me  (Say you love me, say you love me, I know you do)
If he loves me not  (Say you love me, say you love me, I know you do)
If he love me not (Oh, how will I know)
How will I know? How will I know?

(Oh) How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer (Oh) with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

3 ContributorsDon’t Cry For Me (A Cappella) Lyrics
Here we are again
That old familiar place
Where the winds will blow
No one ever knows the time or space

Don't cry for me
Don't shed a tear
The time I shared with you will always be
And when I'm gone
Please carry on
Don't cry for me, me

See, no one is to blame, no, no
My death was meant to be, yeah
Don't carry guilt or shame
The reason why I came
Soon, you're gonna see

So don't cry for me
Don't shed a tear
The timе I shared with you will always be
And when I'm gonе
Please carry on
Don't cry for me
Oh, no, no, no, no

Don't cry
When life is not the joy
It should be
With life comes pain
Soon, time will end its course appointed
And you will be rewarded
And all this world will see

Don't cry for me
Say don't, don't shed a tear, oh
Say the time they shared with you
Will always be
And when I'm gone
See, life still, life still carries on, oh yes
Don't cry for me
They'll always be

Don't cry
Don't cry
For, ooh
Me

3 ContributorsI Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me) (Junior’s Happy Handbag Mix) Lyrics
Oh, I wanna dance
Oh, I wanna dance

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

(Somebody who, somebody who)
Somebody who loves me, yeah
(Somebody who, somebody who)
To hold me in his arms, oh
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
