Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game

Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww yeah

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
When, after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww yeah
(Uh, get down heavy!)

Pleased to meet you, hope you'll guess my name
Aww yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game
Mmm yeah

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
Mmm, yeah

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
Mmm, yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Mmm, mean it, get down
Woo hoo!
Aww yeah
Get on down
Oh yeah
Ba bum bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, yeah

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day

Wild horses couldn't drag me away

Well, when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
And another girl can take my pain away

Take me down, little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
Hey


Take me down, little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the U.S. Mail
Say it with dead flowers at my wedding
And I won’t forget to put roses on your grave
No, I won’t forget to put roses on your grave

And nothing's lost, at such a cost

Yes I've got the desert in my toenail
And I hid the speed inside my shoe

Come on, come on down, you've got it in ya
Got to scrape that shit right off your shoes

I want you to come on and sing it with me one time...

What a drag it is getting old

"Kids are different today"
I hear every mother say
Mother needs something today
To calm her down
And though she's not really ill
There's a little yellow pill

She goes running for the shelter
Of her mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way
Gets her through her busy day

"Things are different today"
I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for her husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake
And she burns a frozen steak

And goes running for the shelter
Of her mother's little helper
And two help her on her way
Get her through her busy day

"Doctor, please
Some more of these"
Outside the door
She took four more
What a drag it is getting old

"Men just aren't the same today"
I hear every mother say
"They just don't appreciate that you get tired"
They're so hard to satisfy
You can tranquilize your mind

So go running for the shelter
Of a mother's little helper
And four help you through the night
Help to minimize your plight

"Doctor, please
Some more of these"
Outside the door
She took four more
What a drag it is getting old

"Life's just much too hard today"
I hear every mother say
The pursuit of happiness
Just seems a bore
And if you take more of those
You will get an overdose

No more running for the shelter
Of a mother's little helper
They just helped you on your way
Through your busy, dying day

Your mouth don't move, but I can hear you speak

He don't come around no more
Is he checking out for sure?
Is he gonna close the door on me?
And I'm always hearing voices on the street
I want to shout, but I can hardly speak
I was making love last night to a dancer friend of mine
I can't seem to stay in step
Because she come every time that she pirouettes over me

And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)

I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed
Plug in, flush out and fire the fucking feed

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the nasty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping

Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene, oh

Chasing shadows, moonlight mystery

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before

Well, I hope we're not too messianic
Or a trifle too satanic

Talkin' about the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
Yeah, talkin' about the midnight gambler
Did you see him jump the garden wall?
Sighin' down the wind so sadly
Listen, and you'll hear him moan
Yeah, well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Everybody got to go
Yes

Did you hear about the midnight rambler?
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
Well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Yeah, the one you never seen before, yeah ahh

Well, you heard about the Boston…
It’s not one of those…
Well, talkin' 'bout the midnight...sh...
The one that closed the bedroom door
I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger
The knife-sharpened tippie-toe...
Or just the shoot-'em-dead, brain-bell jangler
You know, the one you never seen before

So, if you ever meet the midnight rambler
Coming down your marble hall
Well, he's pouncing like a proud black panther
Well, you can say I, I told you so
Well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler, yeah, yeah
Play it easy, as you go
I'm gonna smash down all your plate-glass windows
Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door

Did you hear about the midnight rambler?
He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
And did you hear about the midnight gambler?
And did you see me make my midnight call?
And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
I'll steal your mistress from under your nose
I'll go easy with your cold-fanged anger
I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby
And it hurts!

When the wind blows, and the rain feels cold
With a head full of snow, with a head full of snow
In the window, there's a face you know
Don't the night pass slow? Don't the nights pass slow?

The sound of strangers sending nothing to my mind
Just another mad, mad day on the road
I am just living to be lying by your side
But I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road

Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes
Going to warm my bones, going to warm my bones
I've got silence on my radio
Let the airwaves flow, let the airwaves flow

For I am sleeping under strange, strange skies
Just another mad, mad day on the road
My dreams is fading down the railway line
I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm hiding, sister, and I'm dreaming
I'm riding down your moonlight mile
I'm hiding, baby, but I'm dreaming

I live on an apartment
On the ninety-ninth floor of my block
And I sit at home looking out the window
Imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy
Who's all dressed up just like the Union Jack
Says, I've won five pounds
If I have his kind of detergent pack

I said, "Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby"

The telephone is ringing
I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?"
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?"
“Well, I guess I'm doing fine“
“It's three AM, there's too much noise
Don't you people ever want to go to bed?
Just because you feel so good
Do you have to drive me out of my head?”

I said, "Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby"
Yeah

I was sick and tired, fed up with this
So I decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out
I was so tired and I started to dream
In the morning the parking tickets were just like flags
Stuck on my windscreen

I said, "Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud,"

Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around, baby, two's a crowd

A day that broke up your mind?
Destroyed your notion of circular time?

Ain't flinging tears out on the dusty ground
For my friends out on the burial ground
Can't stand the feeling getting so brought down

It's just that evil life that got me in its sway
It's just that evil life that got me in its sway

There must be ways to find out
Love is the way they say is really strutting out

Whoo
Hey, hey, hey now
One day I woke up to find
Right in the bed next to mine
Someone that broke me up with a corner of her smile, yeah

Ah... hey
Yeah, got some tail

I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
I know you're no scare-eyed honey
There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs, but
It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

I can see that you're fifteen years old
No, I don't want your I.D
And I can see that you're so far from home, but
That's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

Oh, yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh, yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh, yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet, bet your mama don't know you scream like that
I bet your mother don't know you do spit like that

You look so weird, and you're so far from home
But you don't really miss your mother
You look so scared, I'm not no mad-brained bear
But, but it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

Oh, yeah
Woo!
I bet your mama don't know that you scratch like that
I bet she don't know you can bite like that

You say you got a friend that she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs?
If she's so wild, then she can join in too
It's no hanging matter, huh
It's no capital crime

Oh, yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh, yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh, yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet your mama don't know you can bite like that
I'll bet she never saw you scratch my back

Watching girls go passing by
It ain't the latest thing
I'm just standing in a doorway
I'm just trying to make some sense'
Out of these girls that passing by
The tales they tell of men
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend

A smile relieves a heart that grieves
Remember what I said
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
{Bridge}

Don't need a whore, I don't need no booze
Don't need a virgin priest
But I need someone I can cry to
I need someone to protect
Making love and breaking hearts
It is a game for youth
But I'm not waiting on my lady
I'm just waiting on a friend

I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend

Now I am so poor
But never in my sweet, short life
Have I felt like this before

Your heart is like a diamond
You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind


Our love was like the water
That splashes on a stone
Our love is like our music
It's here, and then it's gone

So take me to the airport
And put me on a plane
I’ve got no expectations
To pass through here again

Give me a little drink from your loving cup
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk

I'm the man that brings you roses when you ain't got none
Well I can run and jump and fish, but I won't fight
You if you want to push and pull with me all night

Give me a little drink from your loving cup
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk, yeah

See your face dancing in the flame
Feel your mouth kissing me again

Running up and down the stairs
Well, it seems to me that you have seen
Too much in too few years
And though you try, you just can't hide
Your eyes are edged with tears

You better stop, look around
Here it comes, here it comes
Here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown

When you were a child, you were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways
Of making sealing wax

You better stop, look around
Here it comes, here it comes
Here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown

Oh, who's to blame?
That girl's just insane
Well, nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse
Oh, please

You were still in school when you had that fool
Who really messed your mind
And after that, you turned your back
On treating people kind
On our first trip, I tried so hard
To rearrange your mind
But after a while, I realized
You were disarranging mine

You better stop, look around
Here it comes, here it comes
Here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown

Oh, who's to blame?
That girl's just insane
Well, nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse
Oh, please

When you were a child, you were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways
Of making sealing wax

You better stop, look around
Here it comes

Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown...

[Song 52: Time Is on My Side]
16 ContributorsTime Is on My Side Lyrics
Time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is
Now you always say
That you want to be free
But you'll come running back (said you would baby)
You'll come running back (I said so many times before)
You'll come running back to me

Oh, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is
You're searching for good times
But just wait and see
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more)
You'll come running back (spend the rest of my life with you, baby)
You'll come running back to me

Go ahead, go ahead and light up the town
And baby, do everything your heart desires
Remember, I'll always be around
And I know, I know
Like I told you so many times before
You're going to come back, baby
Because I know
You're going to come back knocking
Yeah, knocking right on my door
Yes, yes!

Well, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is
'Cause I got the real love, the kind that you need
You'll come running back (said you would, baby)
You'll come running back (I'd always said you would)
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more)

Yes time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Oh, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
I said, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Oh, time, time, time is on my side
Yeah, time, time, time is on my side

[Song 53: Far Away Eyes]
17 ContributorsFar Away Eyes Lyrics
I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station
And the preacher said, "You know, you always have the
Lord by your side,"
And I was so pleased to be informed of this
That I ran twenty red lights in his honor
Thank you Jesus, thank you Lord
I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be be off
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find
Much to my surprise, there she was sitting in the corner
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear
Was a girl with far away eyes
But I'll tell you

So if you're down on your luck
And you can't harmonize
Find a girl with far away eyes
And if you're downright disgusted
And life ain't worth a dime
Get a girl with far away eyes

Well

Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do was send
Ten dollars to the Church of the Sacred Bleeding Heart of Jesus
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio
And all my dreams would come true
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer for the girl
Well, you know what kind of eyes she got
But I'll tell you

So if you're down on your luck
I know you all sympathize
Find a girl with far away eyes
And if you're downright disgusted
And life ain't worth a dime
Get a girl with far away eyes
So if you're down on your luck
I know you all sympathize
Get a girl with far away eyes

Got to move while it's still fun
Let me walk before they make me run
After all is said and done
I got to move, it's still fun
I'm going to walk before they make me run

Watched the taillights fading
There ain't a dry eye in the house
They're laughing and singing
Started dancing and drinking as I left town
Going to find my way to heaven
Because I did my time in hell
I wasn't looking too good but I was feeling real well

After all is said and done
I got to move, I had my fun
Let us walk before they make us run


Well, after all is said and done
I did all right, I had my fun
I will walk before they make me
I will walk before they make me run
I will walk before they make me run

So if it's all been said and done
I've got to move, I've had my fun

Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now


Well, I used to wake in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Some things, well, I can't refuse (I can't refuse)
One of them, one of them the bedroom blues

She delivers right on time
I can't resist a corny line
But take the shine right off your shoes, yeah right off your shoes
Carryin', carryin' the bedroom blues

Oh yeah oh yeah, I ain't in love, I ain't in lust, oh no no no
Hide the switch and shut the light, won't you shut it?
Yeah, let it all come down tonight

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
Your face I'll never see no more
Let it all come down tonight
Keep those tears hid out of sight
Let it loose, yeah let it loose, let it loose

26 ContributorsSalt of the Earth Lyrics
Let's drink to the hard-working people
Let's drink to the lowly of birth
Raise your glass to the good and the evil
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Say a prayer for the common foot soldier
Spare a thought for his back-breaking work
Say a prayer for his wife and his children
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth

When I search a faceless crowd
A swirling mass of gray and black and white
They don't look real to me
In fact, they look so strange

Raise your glass to the hard-working people
Let's drink to the uncounted heads
Let's think of the wavering millions
Who need leading but get gamblers instead

Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
And a parade of the gray-suited grafters
A choice of cancer or polio

When I look in the faceless crowd
A swirling mass of grays and black and white
They don't look real to me
Oh, don't they look so strange?

Let's drink to the hard-working people
Let's think of the lowly of birth
Spare a thought for the rag-taggy people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Let's drink to the hard-working people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth
Let's drink to the two-thousand million
Let's think of the humble of birth

Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth

Suicide right on stage
Would it be enough for your teenage lust?
Would it help to ease the pain?
Ease your brain

Feelings would flood on the page
Would it satisfy you? Would it slide on by you?
Would you think the boy's insane?

I'm so hot for her and she's so cold
I'm so hot for her, I'm on fire for her

I'm the burning bush, I'm the burning fire
I'm the bleeding volcano
I'm so hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and she's so cold
{Hook}

Yeah, I tried re-wiring her
Tried re-firing her
I think her engine is permanently stalled
She's so cold, she's so cold
She's so cold cold cold
Like a tombstone
She's so cold, she's so cold
She's so cold cold, cold like an ice cream cone
She's so cold, she's so cold
I dare not touch her, my hand just froze

{Hook}

Yeah, I'm so hot for her, I'm so hot for her
I'm so hot for her and even so
Put your hand on the heat, put your hand on the heat
Aw come on baby, let's go
She's so cold, she's so cold, cold, she's so c-c-c-old
But she's beautiful, though
Yeah, she's so cold
{Bridge}

She's so cold, she's so cold
She was born in an Arctic zone
She's so cold, she's so cold, cold, cold
I dare not touch her, my hand just froze
She's so cold, she's so goddamn cold
She's so cold cold cold, she's so cold

Who would believe you were a beauty indeed?
When the days get shorter and the nights get long
Lie awake when the rain comes
Nobody will know when you're old
When you're old, nobody will know
That you was a beauty, a sweet sweet beauty
A sweet sweet beauty, but stone stone cold

You're so cold, you're so cold, cold, cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
I'm so hot for you, i'm so hot for you
I'm so hot for you and you're so cold
I'm the burning bush, I'm the burning fire
I'm the bleeding volcano

She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible
She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down to earth flavor

Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I, I realize that she's really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby?
Anybody seen her around?
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd

I was flippin' magazines
In that place on Mercer Street
When I thought I spotted her
And getting on a motor bike
Looking really lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?

The salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared?
Has she really gone for good?

Anybody seen my baby? (Anybody seen my baby?)
Anybody seen her around? (Oh, hope anybody seen her around)
If I just close my eyes (I close my eyes)
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen, anybody seen her around?
(Oh yeah, that's what I'm sayin')

We came to rock for Brooklyn
And Queens
And Manhattan
And the Bronx
And Staten Island
I can't forget New Jersey
And Long Island
And all over the world
We came to rock for everybody, uh, like this

Anybody seen my baby? (Anybody, anybody seen my baby?)
Has anybody seen her, anybody seen her around?
If I just close my eyes
I will reach out, reach out and touch the prize
Anybody, anybody seen her around? Oh yeah

(Anybody seen my baby?) Anybody seen her?
(Anybody seen her around?) Lost, lost and never found
I must, I must have called her a thousand times
Oh, sometimes I think she's just in my imagination
Lost, lost in the crowd

Button your lip, baby, button your coat
Let's go out dancing, go for the throat
Let's bury the hatchet, wipe out the past
Make love together, stay on the path

You're not the only one with mixed emotions
You're not the only ship adrift on this ocean

So get off the fence now, you're creasing your butt

And drink it down deeply and love it to death
So button your lip, baby, button your coat

The streets I used to walk on
Are full of broken glass
And everywhere I'm looking
There's memories of my past
The filthy flat in Fulham
The smell of sex and gas
I never ever really knew
Where I was sleeping next

When the whole wide world's against you
And you're standing in the rain
When all your friends have let you down
And treat you with disdain
When the whole wide world's against you
And that's got you on the run
And you think the party's over
But it's only just, only just begun
(Oh yeah)

Behind the bars of prison
You're never getting out
They wanna break your balls in those slimy walls
And the guards are lardy louts
The cameras that are watching you
They see a sullen face
Get me out the door, can't keep me in no more
I'm breaking down the gates

When the whole wide world's against you
And you're standing in the rain
And you want someone beside you
To pull you up again
When the whole wide world's against you
And life's got you on the run
And you think the party's over
But it's only just, only just begun


Well, the dreary streets of London
They never promised much
A dead-end job to nowhere
And all your dreams are crushed
When the whole wide world's against you
And you're standing in the rain
When all your friends have let you down
And treat you with disdain
And you think the party's over
But it's only just begun
Let's raise a glass, get up and dance
'Cause life's just hit and, hit and, hit and run

Hit and run, yeah
The party's over
(Yeah)
World's against you

The police in New York City
They chased a boy right through the park
And in a case of mistaken identity
They put a bullet through his heart

Heart breakers with your .44
I wanna tear your world apart
You a heart breaker with your .44
I wanna tear your world a part

A ten-year-old girl on a street corner
Sticking needles in her arm
She died in the dirt of an alleyway
Her mother said she had no chance, no chance

Heart breaker, heart breaker
She stuck the pins right in her heart
Heart breaker, a pain maker
Stole the love right out your heart

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Wanna tear your world apart
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I wanna tear your world apart

Heart breaker, heart breaker
You stole the love right out of my heart
Heart breaker, heart breaker
Wanna tear that world, wanna tear that world

Ah yeah, ah yeah

Stole the love, stole the love

Hey, let him follow you down
Way underground wind and he's bound
Bound to follow you down
Just a dead beat right off the street
Bound to follow you down

Well the ballrooms and smelly bordellos
And dressing rooms filled with parasites
On stage the band has got problems
They're a bag of nerves on first nights

He ain't tied down to no home town
Yeah, and he thought he was reckless
You think he's bad, he thinks you're mad
Yeah, and the guitar player gets restless

But his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days
Just as long as the guitar plays
Let it steal your heart away
Steal your heart away


But his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days
Just as long as the guitar plays
Let it steal your heart away
Steal your heart away

Joe's got a cough, sounds kind of rough
Yeah, and the codeine to fix it
Doctor prescribes drug store supplies
Who's gonna help him to kick it?

And his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days
Just as long as the guitar plays
Let it steal your heart away
Steal your heart away

Well his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days

Trying to waste his time
With his mentholated sandwich
He's a walking clothesline
And here comes the bishop's daughter
On the other side
And she looks a trifle jealous

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do my jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore

Oh, the gangster looks so frightening
With his luger in his hand
But when he gets home to his children
He's a family man
But when it comes to the nitty-gritty
He can shove in his knife
Yes, he really looks quite religious
He's been an outlaw all his life

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore

Oh, the singer, he looks angry
At being thrown to the lions
And the bass player, he looks nervous
About the girls outside
And the drummer, he's so shattered
Trying to keep on time
And the guitar players look damaged
They've been outcasts all their lives

Me, I'm waiting so patiently
Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore

Oh, there's twenty-thousand grandmas
Wave their hankies in the air
And burning up their pensions
And shouting, "It's not fair!"
There's a regiment of soldiers
Standing, looking on
And the queen is bravely shouting
"What the hell is going on?"
With a blood-curdling "Tally-ho"
She charged into the ranks
And blessed all those grandmas who
With their dying breaths screamed, "Thanks!"

Me, I'm just waiting so patiently
With my woman on the floor
We're just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle
Before it rains anymore

All right, hey, hey, hey, all right, all right

And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies, but I come out on top

What's it all about?
Guess it just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

When all I hear is doom and gloom
With all this darkness in my room
Through that light, your face, I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?

We lost all that treasure in an overseas war
Just goes to show you don't get what you paid for
Bowing to the rich and you worry 'bout the poor
Put my feet up on the couch and lock all the doors

What's that funky noise?
It's the tightening of their screws
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

Boom, boom, boom

Just gazing at some dragon in the sky
What tender days, we had no secrets hid away
Well, it seemed about a hundred years ago

Now all my friends is wearing worried smiles
Living out a dream of what day it was
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up?

Went out walking through the wood the other day
Can't you see the furrows in my forehead?
What tender days, we had no secrets hid away
Now it seemed about a hundred years ago

Now if you see me drinking bad red wine
Don't worry 'bout this man that you love
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up?

And that'll be the way to get along

Well, poor boy spent all he had, famine come in the land
Famine come in the land
Spent all he had, and famine come in the land
Said, "I believe I'll go and hire me to some man
And that'll be the way I'll get along"

Well, man said, "I'll give you a job for to feed my swine
For to feed my swine
I'll give you a job for to feed my swine"
Boy stood there and hung his head and cried
Because that is no way to get along

Said, "I believe I'll ride, believe I'll go back home
Believe I'll go back home
Believe I'll ride, believe I'll go back home
Or down the road as far as I can go
And that'll be the way to get along"

Well, father said, "See my son coming after me
Coming home to me"
Father ran and fell down on his knees
Said, "Sing and praise, Lord have mercy on me
Mercy"

Said, "Father will you look on me as a child?"

Oh mummy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun

Oh daddy, your brain's still flashing
Like it did when you were young
Or do you come down crashing
Seeing all the things you'd done?
All was a big put on

Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mummy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet

And your kids they just won't understand you at all

[Song 85: Depending on You]
12 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschDepending on You Lyrics
Your fingerprints in the dark
Your past and present tangle up in my arms
Our secrets sealed in our scars
Sharing a smoke on the steps of a bar
I was convinced I had your heart in my hands
I was making love into our different plans

Now she's giving my loving to somebody new
I invented the game but I lost like a fool
Now I’m too young for dying and too old to lose
'Cause I was depending on you, yeah
'Cause I was depending on you

It’s time to harden my shell
The toughest part is I know you too well
Now I'm just a story you tell
Embroidering the truth with things you nеver felt
You steal thе spirit right out of a man
Now you're working on him and you don't give a damn

Now she's giving my loving to somebody new
I invented the game but I lost like a fool
Now I'm too young for dying and too old to lose
'Cause I was depending on you, yeah
'Cause I was depending on you


Now she’s giving my loving to somebody else
She threw me down like a book off the shelf
Now I’m too young for dying and too old to lose
'Cause I was depending on you
’Cause I was depending on you

Depending on you
Yeah, depending on you
Ayy, I was depending, relying on you
I was depending, depending on you
I was depending on you

[Song 86: Memory Motel]
18 ContributorsMemory Motel Lyrics
Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl
Her eyes were hazel and her nose was slightly curved
We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel
It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well
It took a starry night to steal my breath away
Down on the waterfront her hair all drenched in spray
Hannah baby was a honey of a girl
Her eyes were hazel and her teeth were slightly curved
She took my guitar and she began to play
She sang a song to me, stuck right in my brain

You're just a memory
Of a love that used to be
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me

She got a mind of her own
And she use it well, yeah
Well she's one of a kind
Got a mind
She got a mind of her own, yeah
And she use it mighty fine

She drove a pick-up truck painted green and blue
The tires were wearing thin, she done a mile or two
When I asked her where she headed for
"Back up to Boston, I'm singing in a bar"
I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge
My nerves are shot already, the road ain't all that smooth
Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone
I keep on a feeling that gnawing in my bones

You're just a memory (Just a memory)
Of a love that used to mean so much to me
(Just a memory)
You're just a memory (Just a memory)
Of a love that used to mean so much to me
(You're just a memory girl)
You're just a sweet memory
And it used to mean so much to me
Sha la laa la
Sha la laa la
Sha la laa la
Sha la laa la
You're just a memory of a love that used to mean so much to me

She got a mind of her own and she use it well, yeah
Mighty fine, 'cause she's one of a kind
She got a mind of her own
She's one of a kind and she use it well

On the seventh day my eyes were all a-glaze
We been ten thousand miles and been in fifteen states
Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind
I hit the bottle and I hit the sack and cried
What's all this laughter on the twenty-second floor?
It's just some friends of mine and they're busting down the doors
It's been a lonely night at the Memory Motel

You're just a memory girl, just a memory
And it used to mean so much to me
You're just a memory girl, you're just a memory
And it used to mean so much to me
You're just a memory girl, you're just a memory
And it used to mean so much to me
You're just a memory of a love that used to mean so much to me
Mean so much to me

She's got a mind of her own and she use it well yeah
Well she's one of a kind

[Song 87: Ventilator Blues]
13 ContributorsVentilator Blues LyricsThe only song in the Rolling Stones' backcatallogue on which Mick Taylor had a writing credit; the rest of the Exile on Main St. was credited to solely Jagger/Richards.
When your spine is cracking and your hands, they shake
Heart is bursting and your butt's going to break
Your woman's cussing, you can hear her scream
Feel like murder in the first degree
Ain't nobody slowing down no way
Everybody’s stepping on their accelerator
Don't matter where you are
Everybody’s going to need a ventilator

When you're trapped and circled with no second chances
Your code of living is your gun in hand
We can't be browed by beating, we can't be cowed by words
Messed by cheating, ain't gonna ever learn
Everybody walking around
Everybody trying to step on their Creator
Don't matter where you are
Everybody, everybody going to need some kind of ventilator
Some kind of ventilator
Come down and get it

What you going to do about it?
What you going to do?
What you going to do about it?
What you going to do?

Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?

[Song 88: Dear Doctor]
17 ContributorsDear Doctor Lyrics
Oh, help me, please, doctor, I'm damaged
There's a pain where there once was a heart
It's sleeping, it's a-beating
Can't you please tear it out and preserve it
Right there in that jar?

Oh, help me, please, mama, I'm sickening
It's today that's the day of the plunge
Oh, the gal I'm to marry
Is a bow-legged sow
I've been soaking up drink like a sponge
"Don't you worry, get dressed," cried my mother
As she plied me with bourbon so sour
"Pull your socks up, put your suit on
Comb your long hair down
For you will be wed in the hour"

So help me, please, doctor, I'm damaged
There's a pain where there once was a heart
I'm sleeping, it's beating
Can't you please take it out and preserve it
Right there in that jar?
Yep
Oh, help me, please, doctor, I'm damaged
There's a pain where there once was a heart
It's sleeping, it's a-beating
Can't you please tear it out and preserve it
Right there in that jar?

I was trembling as I put on my jacket
It had creases as sharp as a knife
I put the ring in my pocket
But there was a note
And my heart, it jumped into my mouth
It read, "Darling, I'm sorry to hurt you
But I've no courage to speak to your face
But I'm down in Virginia with your cousin Lou
There'll be no wedding today"

So help me, please, doctor, I'm damaged
You can put back my heart in its hole
Oh, mama, I'm crying
Tears of relief
And my pulse is now under control
Yeah

Sky diver inside her, slip rope, stunt flyer
Wounded lover, got no time on hand

One last cycle, thrill freak Uncle Sam
Pause for business, hope you'll understand
Judge and jury walk out hand in hand

Dietrich movies, close up boogies, kissing cunt in Cannes
Grotesque music, million dollar sad
Got no tactics, got no time on hand


Left shoe shuffle, right shoe muffle, sinking in the sand
Fade out freedom, steaming heat on, watch that hat in black
Finger twitching, got no time on hand

[Song 90: Heart of Stone]
11 ContributorsHeart of Stone Lyrics
There've been so many girls that I've known
I've made so many cry and still I wonder why
Here comes the little girl, I see her walking down the street
She is all by herself, I try and knock her off her feet
'Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone

What's different about her? I don't really know
No matter how I try, I just can't make her cry
'Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone

Don't keep on looking that same old way
If you try acting sad, you will only make me glad
Better listen little girl, you go on walking down the street
I ain't got no love, I ain't the kind to meet
'Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone

Oh, no, no, no
You'll never break this heart of stone, darling
No, no, this heart of stone
You'll never break it, darling
You won't break this heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no
You better go, you better go home
'Cause you'll, you'll never break this heart of stone
You better, you better drive on home

[Song 91: The Spider and the Fly]
14 ContributorsThe Spider and the Fly LyricsThe B-side of “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction”
Sitting, thinking, sinking, drinking
Wondering what I'd do when I'm through tonight
Smoking, moping, maybe just hoping
Some little girl will pass on by
Don't want to be alone but I love my girl at home
I remember what she said

She said, My, my, my don't tell lies
Keep fidelity in your head
My my my, don't tell lies
When you're done you should go to bed
Don't say "Hi", like a spider to a fly
Jump right ahead and you're dead

Sit up, fed up, low down go round
Down to the bar at the place I'm at
Sitting drinking, superficially thinking
About the rinsed-out blonde on my left
Then I said, "Hi", like a spider to a fly
Remembering what my little girl said


She was common, flirty, she looked about thirty
I would have run away but I was on my own
She told me later she's a machine operator
She said she liked the way I held the microphone
I said. "My, my", like a spider to a fly
Jump right ahead in my web

Well, now, you're a pillar of society
You don't worry 'bout the things that you used to be

You're the easiest lay on the White House lawn
Get out of my life, don't come back

Didn't I see you down in San Antone
On a hot and dusty night?
Weren't you eating eggs in Sammy's there
When the black man drew the knife?
Didn't you drown a Jew in Rampton
When he washed his sleeveless shirt
With a Spanish-speaking gentlemen
The one that we all called Kurt

Come now, gentleman
There must be some mistake
How forgetful I'm becoming
Now you fixed your business straight

Weren't you in Hemlock Road
Back in nineteen fifty-six
You're a faggot little leather boy
With a smaller piece of stick
You're a lashing, smashing hunk of man
Your sweat shines sweet and strong
Your organ's working perfectly
But there's a part that's screwed on wrong

Oh, weren't you at the Coke convention
Back in nineteen sixty-five?
You're the misbred, grey executive
That I've seen heavily advertised
You're the  man
And the  clean
You're the man who squats behind
The man who works the soft machine

Come now, gentlemen
Your love is all I crave
You'll still be in the circus
When I'm laughing, laughing in my grave

When the old men do the fighting
And the young men all look on
And the young girls eat their mummy's meat
From tubes of plasticon
So be wary please my gentle friends
Of all the skins you breed
They have a nasty habit
That is they bite the hands that bleed

So remember who you say you are
And keep your trousers clean
Boys will be boys and play with toys
So be strong with your beast
So Rosie dear, don't you think it's queer
So stop me if you please
The baby's dead, the lady said
"You schmucks all work for me!"

Lately, I can't get no sleep, I'm a real insomniac
I was chattin' with a ghost, wants a hundred and a match
Says, "I know you got the money, where's the man behind the mask?"

I wanna get close to you
I wanna get close to you
I wanna get close to you

I walk this way a million times with a blindfold on my eyes
It's a nighttime business with an angel in disguise
I bargained with the devil, I need heaven for one night
I can't stand this chaos, it's churnin' up my mind

I wanna get close to you
I wanna get close to you
I wanna get lost in you

Talk to me, pour your secrets out, yеah
Tell me I'm the only man you еver dream about
Talk to me, why don't you scream it out? Yeah
Tell me that you'd rather die than live without, live without me


I wanna get close to you

Tell me I'm the only man you ever dream about
Talk to me, why don't you scream it out?
Tell me that you'd rather die than live without, live without me

I wanna get close to you (Yeah, yes, I do)
I wanna get close to you (Oh, oh, close to you)

I was charming, I was lucky
Tell me how, how I've changed

Now I'm out, oh, out of control
Now I'm out, oh, out of control, yeah
Oh, help me now, yeah

And the girls in the doorway
And the boys on the game
And the drunks and the homeless
They all know me
And the police on the corner
Give a nod and a wave
As they point me
To my final destination

I was young, I was foolish
I was angry, I was vain
I was charming, I was lucky
Tell me how, how I've changed

Now I'm out, oh, out of control, oh

By the smile on her face
But I wondered
How was time gonna change her?

She's the sickest thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl

Well, I'm sick and tired and I really have my doubts
I've tried and tried, but it never really works out

Like a lady-in-waiting to a virgin queen
Look at that stupid girl
She bitches about things that she's never seen
Look at that stupid girl
It doesn't matter if she dyes her hair
Or the color of the shoes she wears

Well, I got to take a break from it all
'Cause the wind and the wilderness calls
And I just need some peace from the storms
I got to take a break from it all

And I got to take a break for a while
Where there ain't another human for a hundred miles
I hate being enclosed by the walls
And I got to take a break from it all

I'll be dancing on diamonds, I'll be skating on glass
I'll be chopping up wood, I'll be splitting the halves
An old AM radio is all that I've got
It just plays Hank Williams and some bad honky-tonk
'Cause I got to take a break from it all

And I got to brеak away from it all
From the city and the suburbs and sprawl
And the small town chattеr and the know-it-alls
To a place where no one can call

And I won't hear the sirens or the maddening crowd
Just the bark of a fox and the hoot of an owl
Ain't got no connections or a satellite phone
I'm avoiding the pictures and the people back home
And I just got to break free from it all

You see, they can't last forever, I'll be diving back in
It's good for my soul, yes, it's saving my skin
'Cause I love the laughter, the women, the wine
I just got to break free from it all


But I’m way off the grid, off the trail
I ain’t gonna post and I ain’t gonna mail
I just need some peace from the storm
Well, I got to break away from it all

And I got to break away from it all
And I got to break away from it all
To a place where no one can call
And I got to break away from it all

With Mr. D., with Mr. D

Will it be poison put in my glass?
Or will it be slow or will it be fast?
The bite of a snake, the sting of a spider
A drink of Belladonna on a Toussaint night
Hiding in a corner in New York City
Looking down a .44 in West Virginia

I was dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, Lord, keep your hand off me
Dancing with Mr. D

With Mr. D., with Mr. D
With Mr. D., with Mr. D
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing

Lord, I was dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, Lord, keep your hand off me
Dancing with Mr. D., with Mr. D

One night, I was dancing with a lady in black
Wearing black silk gloves and a black silk hat
She looked at me longing with black velvet eyes
She gazed at me strange, all cunning and wise
I saw the flesh just fall off her bones
The eyes in her skull was burning like coals
Lord, have mercy, fire and brimstone
I was dancing with mistress D

Lord, I was dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, dancing, dancing so free
Dancing, dancing
I was dancing, dancing, Lord, keep your hand off me
Dancing, dancing
I was dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing

[Song 107: Time Waits for No One]
17 ContributorsTime Waits for No One LyricsTime Waits For No One was the first song recorded for the album. It’s a slow and smooth song with latin influences.
Yes, star-crossed in pleasure
The stream flows on by
Yes, as we're sated in leisure
We watch it fly, yes

And time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me
And time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me

Time can tear down a building
Or destroy a woman's face
Hours are like diamonds
Don't let them waste

Time waits for no one
No favors has he
Time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me
Yeah


Men, they build towers to their passing
Yes, to their fame everlasting
Here he comes chopping and reaping
Hear him laugh at their cheating

And time waits for no man
And it won't wait for me
Yes, time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me

Drink in your summer
Gather your corn
The dreams of the night time
We will vanish by dawn

But time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me
And time waits for no one
And it won't wait for me
No, no, no, not for me, no, not for me

We have journeyed far from here
Armed with Bibles, make us swear

Please come see me in the citadel

Flags are flying, dollar bills
Round the heights of concrete hills
You can see the pinnacles

Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

In the streets are many walls
Hear the peasants come and crawl
You can hear their numbers called

Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel

Screaming people fly so fast
In their shiny metal cars
Through the woods of steel and glass

Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel
Oh well!

Waiting for a girl who wears scarves instead of hats
Her zipper's broken down the back
Waiting for a factory girl


Waiting for a girl, and she gets me into fights
Waiting for a girl, we get drunk on Friday night
She's a sight for sore eyes
Waiting for a factory girl

Waiting for a girl, and my feet are getting wet
She ain't come out yet

Hear the screams of Center 42
Loud enough to bust your brains out
The opposition's tongue is cut in two
Keep off the street 'cause you're in danger
One hundred thousand disparus
Lost in the jails in South America

Cuddle up, baby
Cuddle up, tight
Cuddle up, baby
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night

The sex police are out there on the streets
Make sure the pass laws are not broken
The race militia has got itchy fingers
All the way from New York back to Africa

Cuddle up, baby
Keep it all out of sight
Cuddle up, baby
Keep it all out of sight
Cuddle up, baby
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover, undercover
Undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night

All the young men, they've been rounded up
And sent to camps back in the jungle
And people whisper, people double-talk
And once proud fathers act so humble
All the young girls, they have got the blues
They're heading on back to Center 42

Keep it undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Keep it undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night

Down in the bars, the girls are painted blue
Done up in lace, done up in rubber
The John's are jerky little G.I. Joe's
On R&R from Cuba and Russia
The smell of sex, the smell of suicide
All these dream things I can't keep inside

Undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night

Undercover of the night
Undercover of the night
Undercover, undercover

9 ContributorsSlipping Away Lyrics
Guess it's just another dream that's slipping away
Each time that I fall asleep it seems I'm drifting away

Just as you have touched my heart
Babe, I wake and we're apart
Yeah, and it's slipping away

Here comes just another day that's drifting away
Every time I draw a breath it's dying away

First the sun and then the moon
One of them will be 'round soon
Slipping away
Slipping away
Ooh yeah

Drifting away
You see me slipping away

Just as you have touched my heart
I wake up babe and we're apart
It seems we're slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away

All I want is ecstasy
But I ain't getting much
Just getting off on misery
It seems I've lost my touch

Well, it's just another song but it's slipping away
Well we didn't sing it long 'cause it's fading away

First the sun and then the moon
One of them will be 'round soon
Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away

Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away

And I just came into town
Yeah, I'm a lonesome schoolboy
And I just came into town
Well, I heard so much about London
I decided to check it out
Well, I wait in Leicester Square
With a come-hither look in my eye
Yeah, I'm leaning on Nelson's Column
But all I do is talk to the lions
Oh where can I get my cock sucked?
Where can I get my ass fucked?
I may have no money
But I know where to put it every time
Well, I asked a young policeman
If he'd only lock me up for the night
Well, I've had pigs in the farmyard
Some of them, some of them, they're alright
Well, he fucked me with his truncheon
And his helmet was way too tight
Oh where can I get my cock sucked?
Where can I get my ass fucked?
I ain't got no money
But I know where to put it every time

I'm a lonesome schoolboy in your town
I'm a lonesome schoolboy

I'll look for you in seedy bars

What are you scared of, baby?
It's more than just a dream
I need some time
We make a beautiful team

We're not strong, and you're so sweet (You're so sweet)
And some day, babe, we got to meet (Got to meet)
Just anywhere, out in the park
Out on the street, and in the dark
And I'll follow you through swirling seas
Down darkened woods with silent trees

14 ContributorsRock and a Hard Place Lyrics
The fields of Eden are full of trash
And if we beg and we borrow and steal
We'll never get it back
People are hungry, they crowd around
And the city gets bigger as the country comes begging to town

We're stuck between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock
And a hard place

This talk of freedom and human rights
Means bullying and private wars
And chucking all the dust into our eyes
And peasant people, poorer than dirt
Who are caught in the crossfire
End up nothing to lose but their shirts, yeah

We're stuck between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock
And a hard place
You'd better stop
Put on a kind face
Between a rock
And a hard place

We're in the same boat on the same sea
And we're sailing south on the same breeze
Building dream churches with silver spires
And our rogue children are playing loaded dice

You'd better stop, yeah, give it all you got
Give me the truth now, don't want no shame
I'd be hung, drawn and quartered for a sheep
Just as well as a lamb

Stuck between a rock and a hard place
A rock and a hard place
You'd better stop, put on a kind face
Can't you see what you've done to me?
Between a rock and a hard place (That's what I said)
Between a rock and a hard place (Yeah)
You'd better stop (Stop, yeah, you'd better stop)
Put on a kind face (Just a little smile)
Yeah, come on now, yeah
Between a rock and a hard place
Between a rock and a hard place
You'd better stop, put on a kind face
You'd better stop, put on a kind face
Between a rock and a hard place
Between a rock and a hard place

I look out my window watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, "I'm such a lucky guy"
To have a girl like her is a dream come true
And of all the girls in New York, she loves me true

I tell you, it was just my imagination
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me

Soon we'll be married and raise a family
Two boys for you, what about two girls for me
I tell you, I am just a fellow with a one-track mind
Whatever it is I want, baby, I seek and I shall find
I'll tell you

It was just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me

Every night I hope and pray
Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die
Her love is ecstasy
When her arms enfold me
I hear her tender rhapsody
But in reality, she doesn't even know

(Just my imagination) me
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me
I tell you
It was just my imagination once again
Running away with me
It was just my imagination

It was just my imagination once again
Running away with me

Coming down again, coming down again
Where are all my friends? Coming down again

On the ground again, coming down again

Slipped my tongue in someone else's pie
Tasting better every time
She turned green and tried to make me cry
Being hungry, it ain’t no crime

Coming down again
All my time's been spent, coming down again

But she smiled sweetly

And says, "Don't worry"

"There's nothing in why or when
There's no use trying
You're here, begin again
And o'er again"

That's what she said so softly
I understood for once in my life

What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
And they go on rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
Well the joint kept rocking
Going round and round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
And they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

[Song 149: Come On]
9 ContributorsCome On Lyrics
Everything is wrong since me and my baby parted
All day long I'm walkin' 'cause I couldn't get my car started
Laid off from my job and I can't afford to check it
I wish somebody'd come along and run into it and wreck it

Come on
Since me and my baby parted
Come on
I can't get started
Come on
I can't afford to check
I wish somebody'd come along and run into it and wreck it

Everything is wrong since I've been without you
Every night I lay awake thinkin' about you
Every time the phone rings it sounds like thunder
Some stupid guy tryin' to reach another number

Come on
Since I've been without you
Come on
Always thinkin' about you
Come on
Phone sounds like thunder
Some stupid guy tryin' to reach another number

Everything is wrong since I last saw you, baby
I really wanna see you and I don't mean maybe
I'm doin' everything tryin' to make you see
That I belong to you, hon, and you belong to me

Come on
I wanna see you, baby
Come on
I don't mean maybe
Come on
I'm tryin' to make you see
That I belong to you and you belong to me
Come on
I gotta see you, baby
Come on
I don't mean maybe
Come on
I've gotta make you see
That I belong to you and you belong to me

Come on, come on, come on, come on

Well I'm a king bee buzzing around your hive
Well I'm a king bee, baby, buzzing around your hive
Yeah I can make honey baby, let me come inside

Well I'm a king bee, want you to be my queen
Well I'm a king bee, baby, want you to be my queen
Together we can make honey the world has never seen
Well, buzz a while

Sting you bad

Well I'm a king bee, can buzz all night long
Well I'm a king bee, baby, can buzz all night long
Yeah I can buzz better baby when your man is gone
