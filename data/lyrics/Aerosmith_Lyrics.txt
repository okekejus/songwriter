Every time​ that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face gettin' clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah

I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Half my life's in books' written pages
Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away


Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'
While you're far away and dreamin'
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender

Lyin' close to you, feelin' your heart beatin'

Backstroke lover
Always hidin' 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to your daddy, he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothin'
'Til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways"
I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin'
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing, hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
And I know love was here to stay
When she told me to

Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Just give me a kiss


Like this

Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up the knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss
Like this

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing, hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to

Walk this way
Talk this way

Just give me a kiss

I'll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass
I'll talk about something you can sure understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand

I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts....

Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J. Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer

Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto

Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing
It ain't no good when bossman's
Stuffing it down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rocking the street

Home sweet home
Mama, take me home sweet home

I'm just a punk in the street

Ooooh, yeah

There goes my old girlfriend
There's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises?
I guess they don't mean a thing
So, baby, what's the story?
Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
When you don't look back
I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go

Yeah
Girl, before I met you
I was F.I.N.E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner
Yeah, my heart's been doing time
You spent me up like money
Then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Aw, guitar!


Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my loving didn't mean that much
Tell me you aren't dying when you're crying for me

Tell me what it takes to let you go (Ooh)
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go (Oh yeah)
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice

Tell me who's to blame for thinking twice
No, no, no, no, 'cause I don't want to burn in paradise
Ooo
Let go, let go, let go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I don't want to burn, I don't want to burn
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

Barkeep give me a drink

Four bits gets you time in the racks

Fool's gold out of their mines
The girls are soaking wet
No tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back

I'm back in the saddle again

I'm riding, I'm loading up my pistol

I'm riding, I'm shining up my saddle
I'm riding, this snake is gonna rattle

I'm back in the saddle again

You've been fadin', always out paradin'
Keep in touch with Mama Kin

Well, you've always got your tail on the wag
Shootin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon

It ain't easy living like you wanna
And it's so hard to find peace of mind, yes, it is
The way I see it, you got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

Said, you're bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for your dad is just a drag
You still stuff your mind with your dreams
You better check it out
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon

Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea

Forget about your foolish pride (Take me to the other side)
Oh, take me to the other side (Take me to the other side)

My mama told me there'd be days like this
And, man, she wasn't foolin'
'Cause I just can't believe the way you kiss
Uh, uh-huh

To save a lot of time and foolish pride
I'll say what's on my mind, girl
You love me, you hate me, you cut me down to size
You blinded me with love and, yeah, it opened up my eyes

Lovin' you has go to be (Take me to the other side)

I hope all is forgiven
You love me, you hate me, I used to be your lover
You know you had it coming, girl, so take me to the other

You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

You think you're in love
Like it's a real sure thing
But every time you fall
You get your ass in a sling
You used to be strong
But now it's "ooh baby please"
Because falling in love is so hard on the knees

You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

We was making love when you told me that you loved me
I thought ol' cupid, he was taking aim
I was believer when you told me that you loved me
And then you called me someone else's name
Yeah!

There ain't gonna be no more begging you please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone
And your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees

You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

Chip off the old block
Man, you're so much like your sister
My fantasizin' must be outta luck
My old libido has been blowin' a transistor
I feel like I have been hit by a fuck, yeah

I'm jonesing on love
Yeah, I got the DT's
You say that we will
But there ain't no guarantees
I'm major in love
But in all minor keys
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
Yeah!

What are you looking for
It's got to be hardcore
Must be some kind of nouveau riche
Is this your only chance
Or some hypnotic trance
Let's get you on a tighter leash
Own it own it own it


You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

You ain't that good
Is what you said down to the letter
But you like the way I hold the microphone
Sometimes I'm good, but when I'm bad
I'm even better
Don't give me no lip
I've got enough of my own

There ain't gonna be no more begging you please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone
And your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees

I'm jonesing on love
Yeah, I got the DT's

Yeah-yeah!

Well, I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin' about all those things you said
About ordinary people and how they make you sick
And if callin' names kicks back on you, then I hope this does the trick

'Cause I'm sick of your complainin' about how many bills
And I'm sick of all your bitchin' 'bout your poodles and your pills
And I just can't see no humor about your way of life
And I think I can do more for you with this here fork and knife!

Eat the rich; there's only one thing that they're  good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh huh!

So I called up my head shrinker, and I told him what I'd done
He said "You'd best go on a diet, yeah I hope you have some fun
And-a don't go burst a bubble on the rich folks who get rude
'Cause you won't get in no trouble when you eats that kinda food"

Now they're smokin' up the junk bonds, and then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club with Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens when you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit, but go real good with wine!

Eat the rich; there's only one thing that they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh!


Believe in all the good things that money just can't buy
Then you won't get no belly ache from eatin' humble pie
I believe in rags to riches, your inheritance won't last
So take your Grey Poupon my friend and shove it up your ass!

Eat the rich; there's only one thing that they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest!
Eat the rich; there's only one thing that they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; don't stop me now I'm going crazy
Eat the rich; that's my idea of a good time baby

Blood stains the ivories
Of my daddy's baby grand
I ain't seen no daylight
Since we started this band

No more, no more
No more, no more

Store bought clothes
Falling part at the seams
Tea leaf reading gypsies
Fortune telling my dreams

No more, no more
No more, no more

Holiday Inn, lock the door with a chain
You love it and you hate it
But to me they're all the same

No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more

Baby I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage

Stalemate jailbait
Ladies can't refuse
You love them then you leave them
With your sold out reviews

No more, no more
No more, no more

Sweet talking barroom, ladies' disease
Slipping with her lips
Sliding down your knees

No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more

Lived my life a screamer
Bound to a wife in marriage
Baby, I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Ladies hold the aces
And their lovers call it passion
The men call it pleasure
But to me it's old fashioned
Times they're a changing
Nothing ever stands still
If I stop changing
I'll be writing out my will

It's the same old story
Never get a second chance
For a dance to the top of the hill

Babe I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage

You ain't gonna change it, can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you, my friend


When you're low down and dirty, from walking the street
With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet
Say love ain't the same, on the south side of town

We all make mistakes
Yeah, but it's never too late to start again
Take another breath and say another prayer

And then fly away from here
Anywhere, yeah, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly, yeah

If this life?
It seems harder now
It ain't no never mind
You got me by your side
And anytime you want
Yeah, we can catch a train and find a better place, yeah
'Cause we won't let nothing or no one keep getting us down
Maybe you and I could pack our bags and hit the sky

And fly away from here
Anywhere, yeah, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly

Do you see a bluer sky now?
You can have a better life now
Open your eyes
'Cause no one here can ever stop us
They can try but we won't let them
No way

Maybe you and I
Could pack our bags and say goodbye

And fly away from here
Anywhere, honey, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Fly away from here
Yeah, anywhere, honey, I don't, I don't, I don't
Yeah, we just fly away

Hot wax drippin', honey, what do you say?
I got a brand new record that I've got to play
She says, "Not now, boy", but I did anyway
'Cause I'm ready, so ready
Lip-smackin', paddy-wackin', walkin' the street
I got a ragtop Chevy, now I'm back on my feet
I get an EMHO woody when I sit in the seat
'Cause I'm ready, so ready, yeah

I got a girlfriend with the hoochy-coochy eyes
'Cause in the pink she look so fine
She's got the Cracker Jack, now all I want's the prize, honey
Heh-heh-heh!
I know these hookers down on 42nd street
But, uh, ill-gotten booty's not my style
I'll take a rain check 'til I get back on my feet, honey
Heh-heh, yeah!

'Cause I'm alright
Your daddy says I'm alright
Mmm, your momma says, alright
And my old lady says I'm alright

Whipcrackin' floozy, way out of control
She's got a new kind of jelly in her jelly roll
I got the right key, baby, but the wrong keyhole
And I'm ready, so ready
I'm a red, hot pistol and I'm ready to fight
I'm a .38 special on a Saturday night
I'm gonna kiss your boo-boo, honey, make it alright

It kinda keeps my ass in line
One little french kiss, honey, that's my kinda trash

Ain't got no rubbers, now it's rainin' all the time, honey

Let's put our clothes back on
And, by the way, girl, what's your name again? Uh-huh!
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Ow! G-G-G-G-G-Gow!

'Cause it's alright
Ooh, your daddy says I'm alright
And Tipper thinks I'm alright
And Joe Perry says I'm alright

Pitched my tent in the pouring rain
I got a back seat lover that's callin' my name
She's gonna blow my cover, she's hot as a flame
But I'm ready, so ready, ow!
I shove my tongue right between your cheeks
I haven't made love now for twenty-five weeks
I hear that you're so tight, your lovin' squeaks
And I'm ready, so ready

Talk with yourself and you'll hear what you want to know
Got to rise above 'cause below it's only getting worse

Loose-hearted lady, sleepy was she
Love for the devil brought her to me
Seeds of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holding me in

Oh woe is me, I feel so badly for you
Oh woe is me, I feel so sadly for you in time
Bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail

Fireflies dance in the heat of
Hound dogs that bay at the moon
My ship leaves in the midnight
Can't say I'll be back too soon
They awaken, far far away
Heat of my candle show me the way
Seeds of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holding me in

Oh woe is me, I feel so badly for you
Oh woe is me, I feel so sadly for you in time
Bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail

Shot her dead and her heart exploded
Tell me baby now d-dontcha worry
Like lyin' to the hangman jury
I swear I didn't know that .45 was loaded
In fact my memory ain't too clear
That's not to say she didn't get what she deserved
Least that's the way it look from here
Boy when you line the track a lack a
Hey boy don't you line the track a lack a
Hey boy don't you line the track

And every night she take her thing
Into the city and in the mornin' make me beg
Cause If I'd taken all her real titty gritty

[Song 35: Nobody’s Fault]
10 ContributorsNobody’s Fault Lyrics
Lord I must be dreaming
What else could this be
Everybody's screaming
Running for the sea
Holy lands are sinking
Birds take to the sky
The prophets are all stinking drunk
I know the reason why
Eyes are full of desire
Mind is so ill at ease
Everything is on fire
Shit piled up to the knees

Out of rhyme or reason
Everyone's to blame
Children of the season
Don't be lame
Sorry, you're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known
And now he's blown it
Upside down and hell's the only sound
We did an awful job
And now they say it's nobody's fault

Old St. Andres
Seven years ago
Shove it up their richters
Red lines stop and go
Noblemen of courage
Listen with their ears
Spoke but how discouraging
When no one really hears
One of these day's you'll be sorry
Too many houses on the stilt
Three million years or just a story
Four on the floor up to the hilt

Out of rhyme or reason
Everyone's to blame
Children of the season
Don't be lame

Sorry, we're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known
And now he's blown it
Upside down and hell's the only sound
We did an awful job
And now we're just a little too late


Eyes are full of desire
Mind is so ill at ease
Everything is on fire
Shit piled up in debris
California showtime
Five o'clock's the news
Everybody's concubine
Was prone to take a snooze

Sorry, we're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known
And now he's blown it
Upside down and hell's the only sound
We did an awful job
And now we're just a little too late

Seems like the other day
My baby went away
She went away 'cross the sea
It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me

It said that we was through
She found somebody new
Oh, let me think, let me think
What shall I do?

Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no no no no no

(Remember) Walking in the sand
(Remember) Walking hand in hand
(Remember) The night was so exciting
(Remember) Her smile was so inviting
(Remember) Then she touched my cheek
(Remember) With her fingertips
(Remember) Softly
Softly we met with a kiss

Whatever happened to
The girl that I once knew?
The girl that said she'd been true
Oh, whatever happened to
That night I gave it to you?
What will I do with it now?


Oh, no

Uncle Salty told me stories of a lonely
Baby with a lonely kind of life to lead
Her mammy was lusted, Daddy he was busted
They left her to be trusted 'til the orphan bleeds

But when she cried at night, no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane

Uncle Salty told me when she was just a baby
That she'd get by and maybe someday she'd see
But soon she found her mother's love for all the others
The pushers and the shovers was the life to lead

But when she cried at night, no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane, ow!

Ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh yeah, yeah yeah


Now she's doing any for money and a penny
A sailor with a penny or two or three
Hers is the cunning for men who come a-running
They all come for fun and it seems to me

That when she cried at night, no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane

Ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window

[Song 38: Kings and Queens]
10 ContributorsKings and Queens Lyrics
Long ago in days untold
Were ruled by lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold
They dared to bare their wombs that bleed
Kings and queens and guillotines
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive

Oh I know I lived this life afore
Somehow know now truths I must be sure
Tossing turning nightmares burning dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships the Viking spits the blood of father's land
Only to deceive

Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries
Déjà vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die

Screams of no reply they died
Screams of no reply and died
Lordy, lord and then they died
Lord, no then they died



Live and do or die
Long ago were days I told...Lord they died
Kings and queens and guillotines
Live and no reply they died
Long ago were days I told
Kings and queens and guillotines

It surely opened his eyes

Well, she ate it

Voices tried deceivin'
With lies to show the lady the way
At first she stopped and turned
And tried to walk away

Lady was deceiver

The snake was he and she just climbed right up his tree

The street is cold, the dawn is gray
My heart says no but my head says stay
My work is finished, or so I've been told
You can't part the three of us, once we got a hold
I forgot my name
I took a shot on the chin
I'm rearranging my game
Tell by the shape I'm in
In the line of fire, you know what to say
They gave us no choices, just one shade of gray
My legs keep moving, don't seem to stray
But I know each step we take, they're one step away

I found the secret, the key to the vault
We walked in darkness, kept hitting the walls
I took the time, to feel for the door
I found the secret, the key to it all

I got the Nouveauree
And dragged it home to bed
I traded you for me
I took it all and said
I find my own fun, sometimes for free
I got to pay it to come looking for me
Walking on Gucci, wearing Yves Saint Laurent
Barely stay on, cause I'm so God damn gaunt

I found the secret, the key to the vault
We walked in darkness, kept hitting the walls
I took the time, to feel for the door
I found the secret, the key to it all

Checkmate honey, beat you at your own damn game
No dice honey, I'm livin' on a astral plane
Feet's on the ground, and your head's goin' down the drain
Oh, heads I win, tails you lose, to the never mind
When to draw the line
A Indian summer, Carrie was all over the floor
She was a wet nap winner, and rarely ever left the store
She'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right outa me
Oh, pass me the vial and cross your fingers, it don't take time
Nowhere to draw the line
Hi ho silver, we were singin' all your cowboy songs
Oh, you told Carrie, and promised her you wouldn't be long
Heads I win, tails you lose, lord it's such a crime
No dice honey, you the salt, you're the queen of the brine
Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got ta choose
Where to draw the line

Checkmate, don't be late
Take another pull
That's right impossible
When you got to be yourself
You're the boss of the toss
The dice, the price
Grab yourself a slice
Know where to draw the line

You got a heart-beatin' rhythm from the subterranean
I really love you little girl
I don't need to explain

I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl
Like a double shot of lovin' so fine
I've been lovin' you since you was a child, girl
'Cause you and me is two of a kind

Ah, like deja vu I feel like I've been here
Or somewhere else but you've been always near
It's you that's in my dreams I'm beggin' for
But I woke up when someone slammed the door
So hard I fell out of bed
Screamin' mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread
And the moral of the story I can testify
I get stoned on you girl
That's the best reason why

I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl
Like a double shot of lovin' so fine
I've been lovin' you since you was a child, girl
'Cause you and me is two of a kind

Podría quedarme despierto solo para escucharte respirar
Mirarte sonreír mientras estas dormida
Mientras estas lejos y soñando
Podría pasar mi vida en esta dulce rendición
Podría quedarme perdido en este momento para siempre
Donde cada momento que paso contigo es un momento que atesoro
No quiero cerrar mis ojos
No quiero quedarme dormido
Porque te extranaría, bebé
Y no quiero perderme ni una sola cosa
Porque aún soñando contigo
El sueño más dulce que jamás he tenido
Aún te extrañaría, bebé
Y no quiero perderme ni una sola cosa
Acostado cerca de ti sintiendo tu corazón latir
Y me pregunto que estas soñando
Preguntándome si soy yo a quien estás mirando
Luego beso tus ojos y agradezco a Dios que estemos juntos
Y sólo quiero quedarme contigo
En este momento para siempre
Por siempre y para siempre
No quiero cerrar mis ojos
No quiero quedarme dormido
Porque te extranaría, bebé
Y no quiero perderme ni una sola cosa
Porque aún soñando contigo
El sueño más dulce que jamás he tenido
Aún te extrañaría, bebé
Y no quiero perderme ni una sola cosa
No quiero perderme una sonrisa
No quiero perderme ni un beso
Bien, sólo quiero estar contigo
Justo aquí contigo, Justo así
Sólo quiero abrazarte fuerte
Siento tu corazón tan cerca del mío
Y quédate aquí en este momento
Por todo el resto del tiempo, Sí
No quiero cerrar mis ojos
No quiero quedarme dormido
Porque te extranaría, bebé
Y no quiero perderme ni una sola cosa
Porque aún soñando contigo
El sueño más dulce que jamás he tenido
Aún te extrañaría, bebé
Y no quiero perderme ni una sola cosa
No quiero cerrar mis ojos
No quiero quedarme dormido
Porque te extranaría, bebé
Y no quiero perderme ni una sola cosa
Porque aún soñando contigo
El sueño más dulce que jamás he tenido
Aún te extrañaría, bebé
Y no quiero perderme ni una sola cosa
No quiero cerrar mis ojos
No quiero quedarme dormido, Sí

[Song 48: One Way Street]
16 ContributorsOne Way Street Lyrics
Hey look yonder
What's that I see
Well that old bogus honey
Coming after me
I thought you told her
I was out of town
I wonder how she know'd
I was hanging around
Say, listen baby
Don't go wasting your time
You keep a-comin' 'round
You'll hear the same old line
You got a thousand boys
You say you need 'em
You take what's good for you
And I'll take my freedom

Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)

I thought I knew her
My cagey lady
How could my sunshine
Be so damn shady
She'll say she loves to talk
A conversation
But I'm the one
Who makes my situation
It's one way city, mmh
And I thought I knew
It's such a pity, honey
I'm dancing for you

Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)

(Ha ha ha, you know what I'm talking about baby)
(I've seen that butterfly you tattooed on your pants)
(I'm gonna ge' me some of that yeah-heh-heh!)

There's nothing over here
I never showed you
I made it pretty clear
I'm glad to know you
You know your brother Spike
He's on the level
But you always looking
Like you're mad at the devil
Don't say I copped a 'tude
It's all forgotten
It's just you're much too rude
Your fruits are rotten
You know I work so hard to keep it alive
Now all I hear from you
Is nothing but jive

Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)
Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way

You're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet

11 ContributorsMake It Lyrics
Good evening people, welcome to the show
Got something here I want you all to know
When life and people bring on primal screams
You got to think of
What it's going to take to make your dreams

Make It
Don't break it
I said make It
Don't break it
If you do then you feel like the world's coming down on you

You know that history repeats itself
What you just done, so has somebody else
You know you do, you've got to think up fast
You've got to figure what it's going to take to make it last

Make It
Don't break it
I said make It
Don't break it
If you do then you feel like the world's coming down on you

Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catching the blues
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to lose
You're only paying your dues

Dues is the price that you gotta pay
And if you don't they'll get you anyway
Although you know what you've been going through
You're on the brink so think what it takes to...

Make It
Don't break it
I said make It
Don't break it
If you do then you feel like the world's coming down on you

Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catching the blues
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to lose

Down to who knows who, just to socialize
I'm waiting for my girls, when you call my eyes (Ooh)
You got no way to make a man, honey
You got to understand
I'm your man, child, lord of the thighs

Well, well, Lordie my God
What do we got here? (Haha)
She's flashing across the floor
Make it perfectly clear
You're the bait, and you're the hook
Someone 'bound to take a look
I'm your man, child, lord of the thighs


You must have come here to find it
You've got the look in your eyes
Although you really don't mind it
I am the lord of your thighs


You must have come here to find it

Although you really don't mind it

[Song 51: Shut Up and Dance]
12 ContributorsShut Up and Dance Lyrics
Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
Don't get deep, shut up and dance

A love has got a-me down
A tear just hit a-the ground
So I started writing you this song
But the words I wrote came out all wrong
Yeah, but it's all right

Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
Don't get deep, shut up and dance

When you can't define a-the crime
A-then life ain't worth a dime
When they take away everything you got
And they rub your nose in the funky spot
Not without a fight

Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
Don't get deep, shut up and dance

When you work your fingers to the bone
Now what does that get you - nothing
In a crowd of people
You're still alone
You hope that tells you something
The road to heaven is paved in hell
And it makes you wonder
Why we're here at all
Check out the shape of your circumstance
He wears the dress and she wears the pants
Here comes Jill and she needs romance
But you can't do jack, so shut up and dance!


Sex is like a gun
You aim, you shoot, you run
When you're splittin' hairs with Mr. Clean
It's like gettin' head from a guillotine
And the night has just begun

Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!
Don't get deep, shut up and dance

Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
Don't get deep, shut up and dance
Shut, shut, shut, shut, shut up!
Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
Don't get deep, shut up and dance

Up in smoke you've lost another lover
As you take your hit off your last cigarette, yeah

And you don't give a huh
Until the best part of you starts to twitch

Then you wind up like a dog in a ditch
Because love is like a wrong turn
On a cold night, yeah

But you ain't got no case

Freak out! I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
Because love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
The gal was fine as calamine but not
Enough to scratch a seven year itch
'Cause love is like the last licks
Outta Hendrix, yeah
Ain't that a bitch, yeah

Then you feel so out of place
Lickin' up the arsenic
From the same old lace
You know the stuff is poison
But you got to have a taste

Freak out! I'm alone now

Because love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
You think you're high and fine as wine
Then you wind up with your face in a ditch

I'm going under, rats are in the cellar
Going under, skin's turning yellow
Nose is runny, losing my connection
Losing money, getting no affection

New York City blues
East side, west side news
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you
Can believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart

I'm safe complaining, because everything's rotten
Goin' insanin', and everything's forgotten
Feeling cozy, rats are in the cellar
Cheeks are rosy, skin's turning yellow
Loose and soggy, looking rather lazy
See my body, pushing up a-daisies

New York City's dues
East side, west side news
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you
Can believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart

Throw me in the slam

I wake up and wonder how everything went wrong
Am I the one to blame?
I gave up and left you for a nowhere-bound train
Now that train has come and gone
I close my eyes and see you lying in my bed
And I'm still dreaming of that day

What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me
And now that I'm alone all I have is emptiness that comes from being free
What could have been love will never be

An old friend told me that you found somebody new
Oh, you're finally moving on
You think that I'd be over you after all these years
Yeah, but time has proved me wrong
Cause I'm still holding on

What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me
And now that I'm alone all I have is emptiness that comes from being free
What could have been love will never be

We've gone our separate ways
Say goodbye to another day
I still wonder where you are
Are you too far from turning back?
You were slippin through my hands and I didn't understand

What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be
Didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me
And now that I'm alone all I have is emptiness that comes from being free
What could have been love will never be

What could have been love will never be
What could have been love
What could have been love

What could have been love

Because if you do what you've always done
You'll always get what you always got
Uh, could that be nothing?

What goes on when the lights go out
Or who pulls in when I pull out
And what's a one eyed trouser trout?
I was so short sighted
Now the wrong been righted
I feel so delighted
I get so excited
Skin and bones, it ain’t such a pity
If you think I'm vain, better shut you lip

Choke that smoke, honey crack the whip

That sets your heart on fire
And if you let her stuff get into you
It will be all that you desire
When you make love to a sweet tantric priestess
Drink in the bliss of delight
But I'm not afraid when I dance with her shadow
This time I'm gonna get it right

That's cause they know that they're so well endowed
I am not much on Fannie's conversation
Or care too much about her operation
But every time Pandora come my way
I get high, can't explain the sensation
To get it on I got to watch what I say
Or I'll catch hell from the women liberation
Sweet Pandora

Smelling like a flora
Open up your door for me

Mama crack a smile for me
Just for me
Now I ain't what you'd call a city slicker
Or claim to fame to be a slity licker

But every time Pandora come my way

To get it on I got to watch what I say

Open up your door for me

You got nothing else to lose
If ya only lose your mind
When pleasure that is shallow
Causes trouble to be deep
You've been dusted with the devil
While he sweeps you off your feet
Huh

I'll tell you little secret
Make you want to jump and shout
When you talk to me in circles
Take your foot out of your mouth
It's hard enough to make it
When you're living on the street
And you hate to be a wise guy
When your feet are in concrete
Oh, sleeping with the dogs
And you wake up with the fleas
Honey, don't get mad, get even, yeah

Don't get mad, get even, yeah
Don't get mad, get even, yeah
Don't get mad, get even

[Song 66: S.O.S. (Too Bad)]
12 ContributorsS.O.S. (Too Bad) Lyrics
Stagecoach lady, hourglass body
Making things glow in the night
Well, she would if she could, and she'd be good if she would only
Tell her lover she be out tonight

Because I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad, can't get me none of that!

Salt Lake City, salt-licking bitties
Bogies turn, stinking of gin
Well my daddy was hard, his face was pretty scarred
From kicking ass and playing poker to win

Because I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad, can't get me none of that!
It's too bad


And it's too bad
Can't get me none of that!

Loose sold lady, my mama Katie
Chivalry was born at her feet
Well she should have thought twice
When pa showed his dice
The night they put my daddy to sleep

Because I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad, can't get me none of that!
It's too bad, Lord, it's too bad!
I said it's too bad, Lord, it's too bad!
I said it's too bad, it's too bad!
You know it's too bad, it's too bad!

6 ContributorsSunshine LyricsA rocking ballad with a strong Alice in Wonderland influence.
I sold my soul for a one night stand
I followed Alice into Wonderland
I ate the mushroom and I danced with the queen
Yeah, we danced in between all the lines
I followed daylight right into the dark
Took to the Hatter like a walk in the park
But then I met her, yeah, she felt so right
No child of the night, yeah, was she

They called her sunshine
The kind that everybody knows, yeah, yeah
Sunshine
She's finer than a painted rose, yeah, yeah
Sunshine, yeah

Her kind of love's what I adore
What kind of trouble am I in for?
My kind of Heaven lies at Hell's back door
And I got more than I need

'Cause I need sunshine
The kind that everybody knows, yeah, yeah
My sunshine
She's finer than a painted rose, yeah, yeah
Sunshine, yeah


I got the karma but it don't come free
I'll chase that rabbit up an old oak tree
The caterpillar's tryna cop a plea
But the smoke ain't got nothing on me

I got to have my sunshine
The kind that everybody knows, yeah, yeah
The sunshine
She's finer than a painted rose, yeah, yeah

5 ContributorsGirls of Summer Lyrics
When winter hush turns summer pink
In half the time it takes to blink
But it all depends on what you think
About the girls of summer
When all you think of all day long
Is a pretty face inside a song
With a thought like that you can't go wrong
About the girls of summer
Oh yeah... (Do you know... everybody's talking 'bout)

Some girls are all about it
Some girls they love to let it fly
Some girls can't live without it
Some girls are born to make you cry

Over and over again

My favorite thing that drives me wild
Is when a city girl walks a country mile
For the boy she loves God bless the child
Inside the girls of summer
Oh yeah... (Do you know... everybody's talking 'bout)


Yeah... over and over again
Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah

They get you climbing the walls
They get you caught in their spell
They get you speaking in tongues
Could this be Heaven or Hell
To fall in love twice a day
Is such a sweet price to pay
Se - vous - play
The best things about life are free
The pussywillow up your tree
To the one who climbs
They'll always be the girl... yeah


Some girls can't live without it
Some girls got twenty reasons why

Over & over & over & over & over

You say one thing then you do another
You've got it all wrong so you blame it on your mother
You're kicking the dog because you can't get the cat
You know it ain't cool but you like it like that
Everybody talking about what it is what it ain't
Kiss on the devil and you piss off a saint
But it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
You say you don't need nothing but you've got to have it all

I want to know... what kind of love are you on?

Jelly roll Jane, rolling on the rug
Toking on a lover like a brand new drug
Do the same thing every damn day
Do the same thing, do the same thing
Never seem to get enough

I want to know... what kind of love are you on?
I've got to know... what kind of love are you on?

When Jack took Jill up that hill
She charged his ass a quarter
Well he flipped his lid, uh, cause what she did
Oh, she shouldn't hadn't oughta
Rocking in a cradle with a high school vamp
Screaming at a homey like an old tube amp
Up, down, sideways, going in and out of phase
Everybody asks me why I kiss the girls and make them cry

I want to know... what kind of love are you on?
I wan to know... what kind of love are you on?
I've got to know... what kind of love are you on?

Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, what a woman
How are you feeling?

Know I tried, I tried so hard to please her
She'd give me a look if I beg to tease her
There's nothing you can say, nothing you can do
No way you can try to coochie coo
She might be gone tomorrow, oh Lordy what you going to do?


And I tried with an open hand and a heart of sorrow
Hoped that everything would be alright
Don't save too much loving for tomorrow
Get out all your loving here tonight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na


And I tried with an open hand and a heart of sorrow
Hoped that everything would be alright, alright, alright
Don't save too much loving for tomorrow
Get out all your loving here tonight

And there's nothing you can do, nothing you can say
No way you can try to change her way
She might be gone tomorrow, oh throwing it all away

I took a course in Hallelujah
I went to night school for de blues
I took some stuff they said would cool ya
But nothing seemed to light my fuse
But that's all in the past
Like a check that's in the mail
She was a tall whiskey glass
I was an old hound dog
That just loved to chase his tail

Until I met a Blind Man
Who taught me how to see
A Blind Man
Who could change night into day
And if I can
I'm going to make you come with me
Because here come the sun
And we'll be chasing all the clouds away

Some things are never what they seem
My heaven's turned into a landslide
Thank God I woke up from that dream

I met a Blind Man
Who taught me how to see
Blind Man
Who could change night into day
And if I can
I'm going to make you come with me
Because here comes the sun
And we'll be chasing all the clouds away
The bee's chase honey
And drink all the flowers dry
We'll be saving us a little money
And if that doesn't do it, yeah
I know the reason why

Don't make no sense lighting candles
There's too much moonlight in our eyes

I met a Blind Man
Who taught me how to see

Who could change night into day
And if I can
I'm going to make you come with me

Because here come the sun
Ain't no surprise
Ain't no doubt about it

New York was such a pity
But at Max's Kansas City we won
We all shot the shit at the bar
With Johnny O' Toole and his scar
And then old Clive Davis said
He's surely gonna make us a star
I'm going to make you a star
Just the way you are
But with all his style
I could see in his eyes
That we is going on trial
And it was no surprize
The boys kept kicking ass
As usual time would tell
But some bitch in the choir
Throw water on the fires of hell
She loved to show and tell
Lord, she loved to tell
But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial
And it was no surprize

Midnight lady, situation fetal
Vaccinate your ass with your phonograph needle
I say look here, friend of mine
You scratch like you need calamine
Flamingo boots, soles a creaking
Still in love and Puerto Rican too
Riding on wheels of hell
Smoking our axle grease
Oh, the backstage is rocking
And we're copping from the local police
That's right, the local police
Or the justice of peace
But with all our style
You could see in our eyes
That we is still on trial
And it was no surprize

Got my foot inside the door
Knock knock, knock knock, knock

Bad times go away
Come again some other day

Will keep the blues away

Could ever make a mountain fly
If Japanese can boil teas
Then where the fuck's my royalties...aar

And people, they don't seem to care
And sorry just don't cut it, yeah

It hits you like the fangs from a rattlesnake bite

But if we do it right at the speed of light
There's the back seat of my car, caviar

Now I'm feeling low down even slow seems way too fast
And now the booze don't work and the drugs ran out of gas

I got the fever, fever, fever, fever

I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass
Yeah we're all here 'cause we're not all there tonight

And when I woke up I was all alone
Makin' love to the Crack of Dawn
So yo, I beg your pardon sir

Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear
As long as I'm in heaven honey I don't care
You look so good baby look so fine

Chip away, that's what I'm gonna do
Sweet little mama, I wanna get next to you

Tryin' to look so hard
All decked out in your antique dress
While the boys all promenade
Even a rock will crumble
If you strike it night and day
If hammer I must, I'm gonna get through your crust
Gonna chip that stone away

Chip away, chip away at the stone
And I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away, that's what I'm gonna do

[Song 89: The Farm]
12 ContributorsThe Farm Lyrics
It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train
It's far, far away, behind the moon, beyond the rain
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore
Oaahh!

A-there's a cockroach in my coffee
There's a needle in my arm
A-and I feel like New York Cittay
A-get me to the farm

A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

I got terminal uniqueness
I'm an egocentric man
I get caught up in my freakness
But I ain't no Peter Pan
Get me to the farm

A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Get me

Buckle up straight jack
Sanity is such a drag
Jellybean thorazine
Transcendental jet lag
Sanity I ain't gotta
Feeling like a piñata
Sucker punch
Blowing lunch
Motherload
Pigeonholed
I'm feeling like I'm going to explode

Yeah, I wanna shave my head
I want to be a Hare Krishna
Tattoo a dot right on my head
And the Prozac is my fixer
I am the livin' dead
Follow the yellow brick road
Follow the yellow brick road

A-take me to the farm
A-take me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

[Song 90: Lightning Strikes]
6 ContributorsLightning Strikes Lyrics
The boys and Dukes are ready to rumble
The word on the street some heads are gonna tumble
Blades gonna flash when the street gangs clash
In this avenue tonight

When the lightning strikes

Zip gun Johnny's finger is itching
Oh the lid's gonna blow up in hell's kitchen
It's an eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
They're so ruthless when they fight

When the lightning strikes, ooh

And it's a free for all in the parking lot
Tell me who will rule the street
And the night explodes
When the cops bring down the heat

And the chains they crash like thunder
While the weak ones all retreat
Gotta draw first blood
Or they'll read your funeral rights

When the lightning strikes

Um, it's dog eat dog when you're meeting your rival
In the combat zone it's a means of survival
Gonna get last licks on a suicide blitz
On a cloak and dagger night

When the lightning strikes

Ooh, it's a free for all in the parking lot
Over who'll rule the street
And the night explodes
When the cops bring down the heat

And the chains they crash like thunder
While the weak ones all retreat
Gotta draw first blood
Or they'll read your funeral rights


When the lightning strikes
When the lightning strikes
When the lightning strikes
Can't you hear the thunder
When the Lightning Strikes
Can't you hear the thunder
When the lightning strikes
Can't you, can't you, can't you hear the thunder
When the lightning strikes
Can't you, can't you, can't you hear the thunder
When the lightning strikes
Can't you, can't you, can't you hear the thunder
When the lightning strikes
Can't you, can't you, can't you hear the thunder
When the lightning strikes

7 ContributorsSpaced Lyrics
Spaced in time, child of nine
Doing 20 years on the way
Fire and steel, Earth unreal
Find another planet to stay
Papa died, ma survived
Telling me about her ordeal
And the soul she could not feel
'Cause they made her so unreal

Lightning years, disappears
20 million years on my brain
Synthesize, overrides
Trying to keep from going insane
And my soul, I cannot feel
'Cause they made me so unreal

Spaced enough to know I feel there's nothin' out there
Spaced enough to know I feel I really don't care
Spaced enough to feel I'm really losing my mind

And I'm never never never never ever going back
I'm off the track
No one even knows I'm alive
Spaced, without a trace
Waiting for the word to arrive
I'm the last man to survive

Spins a web, sweet surprise
Catches thieves, just like flies
Look out! Here comes the Spider-Man!
Is he strong? Listen, bud!
He's got radioactive blood
Can he swing from a thread?
No escape from his spiderweb
Look out! There goes the Spider
In the chill of night
At the scene of the crime
Like a laserlight
He arrives just in time
Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Doing the impossible and why because he can
Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Doing what he gotta get according to the plan, look out!
Life is a great big bang-up
Wherever there's a hang-up
You'll find the Spider-Man!

Been there and back again

And at steeplechase, she used to wet his dreams
She combs her hair, that flaming jewel
Streaked with Clorox bleach
Coney getting down and dirty
Snorting up the beach

And she'd be screaming (Coney)
And she'd be dreaming (Coney)
Go get them Coney

Neath the city, eating ground round
Underground is pretty gritty
I turned the screw she held the light
That's when I knew she was a

Sight for sore eyes
She was a sight for sore eyes
She was a sight for sore eyes
She was a sight for sore eyes

Playing no fair, sleeping under stairs
Downtown's a pity, taking fair square
Never where it's pretty gritty
I turned the screw she held the knife
Oh holy Jesus

She's a sight for sore eyes
(Oh she's a nitty nitty nitty)
You a sight for sore eyes
(Oh...she's a nitty gritty)

Turn in style
Walk a mile for your titty
Naked foul while under there
Underwear that's pretty gritty
Hey, don't you know people
She's a love lust hussy
She left, oh, she rust me
Dear old girl

She was a sight for sore eyes but she was sitting pretty
Sight for sore eyes she was a nitty gritty
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes

Peeled back and parted
Even in the car
It was delight or demise
I'm living like a leopard king

Sight for sore eyes
She was a sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes
Sight for sore eyes

When your heart is breakin
When your faith has been shaken
When the road you're takin
Takes you nowhere at all

When it all, seems to all go wrong
Remember, nobody can always be strong
We all fall down

I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go through it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall down

When your dreams are shattered
When you feel broken and battered
When every step on the ladder
Takes you nowhere but down

And you lose ground, like you can't hold on
Remember, nobody can always be strong
We all fall down

I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go through it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall
I will lift you, high above the rain
I'll be with you, we all feel the pain
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall down

Everyone breaks
You'll get hurt sometimes, in this life
You fly so high, you crash and burn sometimes
And I want you to know, you are not alone
We all fall down (we all fall down)

I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go through it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall
I will lift you, high above the rain
I'll be with you, we all feel the pain
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall

I will catch you (I will get you)
I won't let you
So don't feel left out, we all fall down

Her cauldron begs for one more bone
And so my love, this story's told

But the girl keeps coming apart
I feel sedated
Boxed up and crated
Because the girl, she's coming apart

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Let it get me down
Don't let it get my down

So there she was
Buns up and kneelin'
I was a wheelin and a dealin'
My ace in the hole so to speak

2 ContributorsBeautiful Lyrics
A friend of mine was talking
I was ear jacking, eaves dropping
Down on my knees
So I could hear what she was saying
As I got closer
To her fire, her desire
Was to lead me on and on and on
And it was like
Beautiful!
We're free again, we're outta here
Beautiful!
You be my friend
Let's disappear
Now I got to thinking
Bout the high speed dirty deed
It's what I want, what you need
I think you best believe it
Call it what you will
But you still gotta know
We can skin it, we can sit it
Yeah, so baby let's begin it
Saying

Beautiful!
We're free again, we're outta here
Beautiful!
You be my friend, let's disappear
Beautiful!
Do all the things we never tried
Beautiful!
Just spread your wings and let it fly

Whoa whoa
(Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

7 ContributorsBright Light Fright Lyrics
It's the dawn of the day and I'm crashed and I'm smashed
As it is I'm feeling like my chips are cashed
All of my clothes strewn all over the room
The crisis at hand is I'm all out of zoom

I got the sunlight blues
I can't find my shoes
The only thing on TV
Is the good morning news

The tricks of the night keeping me in a daze
We'll open a bottle and I'll pull down the shades
Glance in the mirror, back into bed
We'll get up the same time to party again

I got the sunlight blues
I can't find my shoes
The only thing on TV
Is the good morning news

Bright Light Fright, Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright, go give me  the night
Bright Light Fright, Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright, go give me  the night

I got the sunlight blues
I can't find my shoes
The only thing on TV
Is the good morning news, woo


Bright Light Fright, Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright, go give me  the night
Bright Light Fright, Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright, go give me  the night

I got the sunlight blues
I can't find my shoes
The only thing on TV
Is the good morning news

And I'm gonna break

Somethin' gotta give
Tell me when to turn the screw
Does the noise in my head bother you?

Feels like flesh but tastes unreal

Was sittin' on your interface

[Song 113: Critical Mass]
5 ContributorsCritical Mass Lyrics
Arriving in boats, black hooded coats
Tormentors climbed into my room
I crawled under my bed, covered my head
But they're flushing me out with a broom
The leader, she's small, pinned my ass to the wall
For my seeds or she'd be losing her past
Time after time, she'd be reading my mind
But she never got the feeling to last

Celebrate, celebrate, celebrite it
This is the critical mass

So far so good, I heard the other say
So good so far, they're taking' me away
I drink to you, your mind, her ass
We'll take a drink and break the glass

Celebrate, celebrate, celebrite it
This is the critical mass

Now the tallest of two, with a brush full of blue
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall
So I tell her for fun, that it's really well done
But she just isn’t listening at all
She points to my heart, telling me if I'm smart
I'll practice and phase
Out and admit, when the shoe doesn't fit
And I went screaming out down the hall

Really need it
Really need your love
Really need your love
Need your love need your love love love love love love love love love love
Just then I heard a pounding on the door
We're all here, sang the voice of twenty more
I drink to you alas
We'll take a drink and break the glass

Celebrate, celebrate, celebrite it
This is the critical mass

Time in space, is taking me away
Time erase, don't know the time of day
Time in space, is taking me away
Time erase, don't know the time of day
Time in space, is taking me away
Time erase, don't know the time of day

6 ContributorsCan’t Stop Lovin’ You Lyrics
I fell from holy Moses mountain
Where love’s a slippery slope
And all the others I've been hangin with
A-never gave me too much room
And then one day she came to me
Love at first sight, head to toes
I love her wild, my mountain child
And that’s just how she goes
And here she got

Hey, I can’t stop loving you
Cause it’s all I want to do
Yeah the world needs more of this
Tell me what you put into that kiss
Now keep that coming on
Let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you’re all I wanna do
Cause I can’t stop loving you

Got me a good old time and cowboy
He got my picture on the fridge
And the first time that he kissed me
We was high up on the ridge
And when we came down from the mountain
On a ride with my mckean
And for all it costs, for getting lost
There ain’t no better sin
Here we go again

Hey, I can’t stop loving you
Cause it’s all I want to do
Yeah the world needs more of this
Tell me what you put into that kiss
Now keep that coming on
Let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you’re all I wanna do
Cause I can’t stop loving you

When I wake up and see your face
All that jump in a picture lace
And that there’s nowhere else I would rather be
Then all tied up in this Rhapsody in Blue

Hey, I can’t stop loving you
Cause it’s all I want to do
Yeah the world needs more of this
Tell me what you put into that kiss
Now keep that coming on
Let me hear my favorite song
Yeah you’re all I wanna do
Cause I can’t stop loving you

[Song 115: LUV XXX]
4 ContributorsLUV XXX Lyrics
There is nothing wrong your perception of the reality
Do not attempt to adjust the illusion
We control the harmonics
We control your emotions
We will move you to the left
We will move you to the right
We can reduce the volume to a whisper
Or increase it to a deafening roar
Now is the time to submit quietly
We control all you hear and feel
You are about to enter a great adventure
And experience the odd and mystery
From your ultimate fantasies, to your deepest fears
From which you may never return

Hello! Hello! Hello!
Come on, come on, come over
Hello! Hello! Hello!
Until the storm blows over

Love three times a day, love your life away
Love three times a day, and get yourself back into the jam
Love three times a day, there ain't no other way
It's in your DNA, let everybody know who you am

Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye!
Nice of you to stop over
Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye!
Before you do all over

Love three times a day, lock yourself away
Hate is so passe, and get yourself back into the jam
Love three times a day, no naivete
It's in your DNA, and tell them that you came with the band
It's the same old same old, pudding in the taking
If you really need a lover, honey, call my name
You can lose your mind looking for a pearl
Like you're looking for a diamond in a rhinestone world
There's one kinda lover that's a just my style
That's a downtown baby with an uptown smile
Top hat glovers, kissing lipstick girls
Kissing high heel lovers with the serious swirls

Love three times a day, love your life away
Love three times a day, and get yourself back into the jam
Love three times a day, there ain't no other way
It's in your DNA, let everybody know who you am

There's no other lover in the whole wide world
That could love me like a lover yeah but this kinda girl
Had a way that she loved that nobody else could
In a way that she could love that everybody understood
But too bad for you when you ain't got no
When you be getting out of jail, we're going to all have fun
Where's your game face, baby? Don't chaa look so sad!
I'm the best damn lover that you ever, ever had!
Love three times a day!
I'm a cha-ching lover, I'm the cat's meow
I ain't never going to stop, and I never know how
It's like you done a lotta living, in too few years
You don't want to get drown in somebody else's tears
Love three times a day!

Hot monkey sex on a hot tin roof
You be higher than a shot of a million proof
It's the same old same-old pudding in the tain
If you really need a lover
Honey, call... my... NAAAAAME!

At the plant we proved them wrong
We traded in our soul tonight and sold them for a song
And if Satan had a lady friend, her name was Mary Jane
I never wondered why she tried to drive us quite insane
And how we got that golden fleece
From tokin on that pipe of peace

There is a God cause I got me a

This girl that I knew
She loved me and blew me away
We made love, no doubt
But she never went out of her way
Yeah

I keep wonderin', I keep wonderin' why
Do the wings of your butterfly
Lightnin' thunder
I keep wondering why

Hey, I think you need an attitude adjustment
Knock-down drag out
I got to make myself a latitude adjustment
With or without

I was rather naive
So I didn't believe when you said
"Our love is in jail"
Honey, you hit the nail on the head

Well, I keep wonderin', I keep wonderin' why
Do the wings of your butterfly
Lightnin', thunder
It ain't no wonder why

Hey, I think you need an attitude adjustment
Knock-down drag out
Don't you ever, baby, wonder where the lust went
With or without


Now I know what it is
A-cause I know what you are
No more cryin' eyes, my friend
Excuse fuckin' moi
No more wonderin'
I got news for you

Hey, I think you need an attitude adjustment
Knock-down drag out
I gotta make myself a latitude adjustment
I'm headin' south

Yeah, I think you need an attitude adjustment

[Song 118: Luv Lies]
4 ContributorsLuv Lies Lyrics
Ahh when you cross that line that you know you can't erase
To fall in lust, not love, ain't no sin at all
And tell me when your with your best friend's friend, do you still feel out of place?
No thanks, I took that ride
God only knows I tried believing

I imagine everyone sometimes
Would cross their heart and hope to die to tell "I love you" lies
I imagine everyone survives
For giving up all that you got to tell "I love you" lies

First time you look for love, you find you don't know jack
Yeah, so much for mind games you play to win
'Cause first you lose your heart's desire, then you get it back
But ignorance ain't bliss
There's so much more behind the kiss I'm feeling

I imagine everyone sometimes
Would cross their heart and hope to die to tell "I love you" lies
I imagine everyone survives
For giving up all that you got to tell "I love you" lies

When loneliness and paranoia feeds me
God help the person who needs me


If ignorance is bliss, then take me off the list, I'm leaving

I imagine everyone sometimes
Would cross their heart and hope to die to tell "I love you" lies
I imagine everyone survives
For giving up all that you got to tell "I love you" lies

Looking for a friend of mine
Waiting to salute the flag
Talking to some he/she
Sliding over next to me
Man, she said, this life is a drag
It's a shaky situation
And I'm hanging on my will
And I get no satisfaction
From a hundred dollar bill
But I got what i came for
And I'll do it until i drop
You do what you want to do
I ain't never going to stop
You say you got something that
Makes you feel good
And you can't stop messing with it
All your life you've been
So misunderstood
Because you can't stop messing with it
Sitting by the seashore
Dreaming about a little more
Circling the classifieds
Nine seven six
Man I need another fix
I'll never have to kiss the bride

Yeah, the city is a war zone
This country gone to hell
And the beer cans in the alley
From the rich folks on the hill
They're screaming hallelujah
But I don't give a damn
Because I got my own religion
Yeah, it's right here in my hand
You say you got something that
Makes you feel good
And you can't stop messing with it
All your life you've been
So misunderstood
Because you can't stop messing with it

You say you got something that
Makes you feel good
And you can't stop messing with it
All your life you've been

Now you can't stop messing with it

Now you can't stop messing with it

Got to get it up, get it up, come on Nancy

You know you really want to
Love me until the sun

4 ContributorsDevil’s Got A New Disguise LyricsAn outtake that later baptized an Aerosmith compilation.
If you see Kay, you got to revel
No angel wings more like the devil
She was so hot, so cool and nasty
Believe it or not here's what she asked me
'If you need love with no condition
Let's Do the Do honey I'm on a mission

Ain't no mistaking, my body's shaking
My soul's been taken
By a Devil with a New Disguise
The girl's so witching, my backbone's twitching
Because down in Hell's kitchen
The Devil's got a New Disguise

If you see Kay, tell her I love her
She did me in but I'll recover
She said love was her desire
All that she touched she set on fire
She was so diss - I couldn't slay her
She blew a kiss - I threw the dagger


She came from the wrong side of town
Everytime she got off she gets knocked back down
She's Heaven materialized
She's giving me Hell but it ain't no suprise
She's a bit uncivilized

Hey
Give my heart a break
You say it's you that loves me more
And then you kick and slam your door
Hey
While you're on your way
I want to thank you for the ride
And pull the thorn out of my side

And call me your baby
I kiss away the tears you cried
And then you go and leave me
Pissed off and alone
It's all about your sweet thing
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes
Yeah, what it takes to make this love survive

Another last goodbye

You crash and burn
As the pages turn
In your black book full of names
And then you thaw your frozen heart
Out in somebody else's flames
And it's a low down dirty, dirty shame
Don't let this love slip through the cracks
I miss your claw marks on my back


Another last goodbye
(Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah)

I believe I've always been in love with you
Though we got caught up in the sway
Never knowin where we left
Been off the hook and out of hand
Sometimes I feel that love is a crime
Cause I remember, yeah, the very first time


Another last goodbye

Callin' on dreams from within

So be it, I need it, long hair, blue eyes
She drives me crazy

Until you open up your heart to receive
Cause if the love you got's that same old crime
We're talking tenderness that's so hard to find
And I'm getting behind you


Do you remember them times talking in your sleep
With a pocket full'a rubbers you never could keep
From your best friends lover you dreamt about then
When you pulling up the covers the voices in your head
Say if you want it bad
Don't ever let it slip away

Cause if it's love you want and tenderness... yeah


Oh... lay it down
Gonna lay it down tonight
Gonna come around tonight
You got to lay it down

[Song 129: Avant Garden]
5 ContributorsAvant Garden Lyrics
I had a friend who spoke of fate and he
Knew of another place in space and time
He told of how me and my lady
Could look but we would never find
Said if you please, I beg your pardon
Sometimes the things you see, they just ain't so
Your life can be an avant garden
'Cause loves what makes your garden grow

The sun leads the way (Sun leads the way), the moon lights the sky (Moon lights the sky)
I see you and I lying in my avant garden
I dream of the day (Dream of the day) when our worlds collide (Our worlds collide)
We won't be denied here inside our avant garden

Sometimes my life ain't what it seemin'
Right from the start, it's what your heart's believin'
Could all this just be lucid dreamin'?
But dreams just ain't enough for me

The sun leads the way (Sun leads the way), the moon lights the sky (Moon lights the sky)
I see you and I lying in my avant garden
I dream of the day (Dream of the day) when our worlds collide (Our worlds collide)
We won't be denied here inside our avant garden

You know it just ain't right to deal with other's shite
No one should ever be so broken hearted
Don't ever be afraid 'cause when you got it made
Yeah, you don't even have to try


So I'll be waitin' in your garden
Watching all your flowers grow

The sun leads the way (Sun leads the way), the moon lights the sky (Moon lights the sky)
I see you and I lying in my avant garden
I dream of the day (Dream of the day) when our worlds collide (Our worlds collide)
You'll know we've arrived here inside our avant garden
Yeah, yeah


The sun brings the rain (Sun brings the rain) the moon needs the sky (Moons needs the sky)
I see you and I lyin' in my avant garden
Beware of the lies, a word to the wise
There's sweet cherry pies and truth inside our avant garden

2 ContributorsCryin’  Lyrics
There was a time
When I was so broken hearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
Now listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm trying to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dying cause I let you
Do what you do - down on me

Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same

It's down on me
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm trying to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dying cause I let you
Do what you do - down on me

Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, love, sweet love, ain't love
'Til you give your heart away

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' just to let you
Do what you do what you do down to me

Baby, baby, baby

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' cause I let you
Do what you do down to , down to, down to, down to

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' to forget you
Your love is sweet

Oh, she's on fire
Oh, she's on fire

Hot to trot, she's a bit insane
Little bit a pleasure
With a little bit a pain
I got to be smoking
So I know without a doubt
Where there's smoke there's fire
So I got to boot it out

Say oh, she's on fire
Oh, she's on fire

Homely child with a hang down lip
Starved for love and companionship
Little by little, catching up to me
She's more of a woman
Then I thought she'd be to me...yeah
Hungry girl, she's the skinniest thing
She's saying the word, I'm losing sting?
She's on fire
She hung my head in a guillotine
She's my flame, she's a wetting my dream
She's on fire

Oh, she's on fire
Oh, she's on fire
Oh, she's on fire

3 ContributorsFace Lyrics
Behind the walls of my temptation, that's where it all began
She tied me up with my frustration and snapped my rubber band
I remember her sweet patchouli she absolutely adored
It's all about with who you're hanging and she gave me too much rope

She's a queen of my delusion
She's my zen from way back when
And because of my confusion
Is a face without a name

She lived on Lucky Charms and coffee
And Cracker Jacks surprise
She had me all reborn and then she killed me with her eyes

She's a queen of my delusion
She's my zen from way back when
And because of my confusion
Is a face without a name (Face without a name)
Huh, huh, huh
Yeah, yeah

Try and get a little bit there's really nothing wrong with it if no one sees you
What you gonna say when I don't know anyone blame it on the damn amnesia?
Forgotten love don't got away, she's still a name without a face (Oh yeah)

We did a little nip and tuck then
She whispered to my brain
She said let's fuck then I forgot her name

She's a queen of my delusion
Shes my zen from way back when
And because of my confusion (Face without a name)
Yeah, I've come to that conclusion
And she comes to me at all (Comes to me at all)
And because of my confusion (Face without a name)
Is a face without a name (Face without a name)

I didn't know that she'd know (She'd know, she'd know)
She stoned me
I think I've got it bad and I can't let it go
I thought I knew me much better

Autumn and cashmere, all orange and green
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
Creme de gardenia and black Vaseline
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
It's so not fair

Completely inside my head imagine pretending
She's the book that I've read with a beautiful ending
It really drives me mad, I can't leave her alone
'Cause I won't let me forget her

Rose colored glasses you know what that says
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
Her sweet molasses all mine, pasque frez
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
Yeah, yeah


Totally out of control
She owned me

Sweet almond eyes just to see and be seen
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
She tasting like cherries, sweet love's grenadine
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
Makes love like a rabbit to my velveteen
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
A 10 with a smile like a young Norma Jean
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous

Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
You gotta dance to the tune of Bolivian Ragamuffin
Out take's short breaks
Love her til the earth quakes
Standing on the seashore looking at the city
See the street light, dog bite your lady on the titty
At the wax museum everybody cares to see themselves
As others care to see you but nobody wants to be you baby
Corporate, cabbage head
Try and get a salad made
Hold my pickle, hold your lettuce
Special orders don't upset us
Kickstand face, looks so evil like Knievel
Never make third base like a tongue in my old lady
Like a squatez vous and a domo arigato
Tip my hat to you rock a roller obbligatto
Stage show come in stride
Smoke a bone I'm feeling fine
Girls in heat will try and get us
Hash in bones won't upset us

He need cash....Kick in the pants
Wanting for....Got to dance
Say it ahh....To you to give us the chance

Ain't gonna to do it...ain't gonna to do it

You're a no good heart breaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
I don't know why I let you do these thing to me
My friends keep telling me that you ain't no good
They don't know that I would leave you if I could

I guess I'm on tight
And I'm stuck like glue
'Cause I ain't never
I ain't never
I ain't never, no, no
Loved a girl the way that I
I love you

Sometimes I know I thought
You would run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose
The way you treat me is shame
How could you hurt me so bad
Baby, you know that I'm the best thing that you ever had
Kiss me once again
Don't you never never say that we are through

Because I ain't never
Never
Never, no, no
Loved a girl the way that I
I love you

I can't sleep at night I can't eat a bite
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got your hooks in me

I ain't never loved a girl
I ain't never loved a girl
Ain't never loved a girl that hurt me so bad
What am I going to do about it
I tell you I'm going to hold on to her
I'm going to hold on to her

[Song 142: Street Jesus]
5 ContributorsStreet Jesus Lyrics
You better listen to me, brothers and sisters
The day of reckoning will begin

Hey have you heard the news?
Somebody stole my shoes
And I can smell the booze
How indiscreet
And though I had a plan
After that thief outran
Into another man
Who had no feet
I swear to god that day
That guy with no feet say
"You got to walk my way"
"That's how it's planned"
That's when I thought, "good grief"
J-Just ain't my belief
Until I saw the holes
Inside his hand

Street Jesus
Street Jesus

Come on, come on, what you think about life?
Demon in heaven gotta carry a knife
You said to me, "no, that ain't the plan"
With a smile on his face and the holes in his hand
Wise man tell ya what they're reading from a scroll
But things kinda change when the story gets told
They tell it like it is to everybody they meet
Just to sing it in the church what they're preaching in the street

Placate and vacate your mind
Too late to make hate you'll find

Street Jesus
Street Jesus

Good God Almighty, s'posed to be about love
You must've wished upon me by kissing the glove
I'm a high-stepping lover, sharp as a knife
I'm a pink flamingo on a great long life
A wise man, poor man, beggar man too
You bet your bottom dollar but whatcha gonna do?
I can make up daylight jealous of the night
I try to play the game but I never get it right!

Placate and vacate your mind
Too late to make hate you'll find

When you wonder what's up
With your half empty cup
Say tell him "don't give up"
"Reach for the stars"
You think you're so street wise
Just pray and close your eyes
Until we colonize
The moon and stars
But wouldn't it be great
If we could wipe the slate
When we all live in hate
And all this fear
So please don't call me "sir"
If your whole life's a blur
And Mr. Bartender
Another beer
Sometimes it's hard trying to keep up the pace
The train kept a rolling when you're trying to win the race
If you don't believe me, wanna stay in the game
You gotta know who from the heavens came
They tell it like it is to everybody they meet
Cause they're singin in the church what they're preachin in the street
If you wanna give 'em hell then you tell it from the steeple
But I'd rather be a priest so I can scream it to the people

Placate and vacate your mind
Too late to make hate you'll find
You won't get too many tries
Love is the love of my life

Street Jesus
Street Jesus

You're outta your head (Yeah)
So outta your head (Yeah)
Stay outta your head
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah)
Stay outta your head (Yeah)
Stay outta your head
You better get with it 'cause you're so without it
You're outta your head (Yeah)
So outta your head (Yeah)
Stay outta your head

Somewhere, somewhere underneath the rainbow
Somewhere, somewhere underneath the rainbow
Somewhere, somewhere underneath the rainbow

[Song 150: Push Comes to Shove]
5 ContributorsPush Comes to Shove Lyrics
Can you be in love
When you live alone
Push come to shove
When you're bitching on

Now look at every
I'm tonne on you without a doubt
Said the music does the talking
But all you heard is talk about

The girls are left behind
When forty women all spend time
With me and the boys
And the toys, yeah

Rosie said she was fine for two
With blonde hair, by crack it
Miles of blue
Soogie, she was on my side
Because she and Nancy
Ah they took me for a ride

The girls are left behind
When forty women all spend time
With me and the boys
And the toys, yeah

Talk about it
Walk about it
Talk about it
Talkabubi
Talk about it
Talk about it
Dedumdudidudi

Can you be in love
When you live alone
Push come to shove
When you're bitching on

She looked, well, about 35 to me
When mine was still coming on to you
But I was covered back, back then
Because me and the boys
And the Toys in the Attic
Her sister, she was lank a fin
Never tought I'd given in
Her candle of youth was burning low
But me and the boys
Knew something had to go

The girls are left behind
When forty women all spend time
With me and the boys
And the toys, yeah
Dededudidudu

Talk about it
Walk about it
Talk about it
Talkabubi
Talk about it
Talk about it
Dedumdudidudi

Can you be in love
When you live alone
Push come to shove
When you're bitching on
Can you be in love
When you live alone
Push come to shove
When you're bitching on
Huh!


Can you be in love
When you live alone
Push come to shove
When you're bitching on
Can you be in love
When you live alone
Push come to shove
When you're bitching on
Can you be in love
When you live alone
Push come to shove
When you're bitching on
