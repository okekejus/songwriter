The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away


I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

(I always hated that third verse)
*Laughter*
It was a nice short version
Do you wanna- uh, pick it up?
I't's alright (It's good)
(We got a short version)
It might have that other verse on it in another take
Well, I'll tell you what... Let's... uhm...
Well, if I feel like my song's a song... *Laughter*
It don't care... (There you go!)
I don't care if it's short
And I feel like my song's a song
A pleasure! Two minutes... I've recorded songs two minutes
(They were huge hits!)
Have you got, uh, time on that?

I hear the train a-comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby, my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well, I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher

The ring of fire
The ring of fire


I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down

And it burns, burns, burns

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Well, go on down to Jackson, go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand, you big-talkin' man, and make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, go to Jackson, go comb your hair
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson
See if I care

When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow (Hah)
All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson, you turn-a loose-a my coat
'Cause I'm goin' to Jackson
"Goodbye," that's all she wrote

But they'll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you 'round town like a scolded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Japan Fan

Well now, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson, and that's a fact
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson
Ain't never comin' back

"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
One of the four beasts saying, 'Come and see'
And I saw, and behold a white horse"

There's a man goin' 'round takin' names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reachin' down
When the man comes around

The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singin'
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
Voices callin', voices cryin'
Some are born and some are dyin'
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

Till Armageddon, no shalam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise men will bow down before the throne
And at his feet, they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around

Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singin'
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
Voices callin', voices cryin'
Some are born and some are dyin'
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around

"And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts 
And I looked, and behold a pale horse:
And his name that sat on him was Death
And Hell followed with him"

"If you're goin' to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride"

You can run on for a long time

Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angels' feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, "John, go do My will!"

Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Well, you may throw your rock, and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down

Early one morning, while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine, and I shot my woman down
I went right home, and I went to bed
I stuck that loving .44 beneath my head
Got up next morning, and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine, and away I run
Made a good run, but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

Laid in the hot joints, taking the pills
In walked the Sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, "Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"
"Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant, just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more"

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train, and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next morning, 'bout a half past nine
I spied a Sheriff coming down the line
Hocked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, "Come on you dirty hack into that district court"

Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read, "In the first degree..."
I hollered, "Lordy, Lordy, have mercy on me"
The judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Come all, you've got to listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey, and let that cocaine be

"These men have receptions
Matlock A50632, and Batshelter A39879
They have receptions"
Is that gonna be on the album?
Yeah
I doubt that

Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the time

I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak-of-lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black

I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred-thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side

Well, there's things that never will be right, I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Until things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black

27 ContributorsBig River LyricsThe song peaked at #4 and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks on the Billboard Country Charts. Recorded on the 12th of November, 1957 in Memphis and released as Sun Single #283.
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I followed you, big river, when you called

Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river
A freighter said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the Gulf
She loves you, big river, more than me


Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

You said one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, and we're doing it again

You say love is a temple, love the higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you've got
When all you've got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you've got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

It’s been covered by multitudes,
including the Finnish death metal band Children of Bodom:

And Blues Brothers:
An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny, and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard, and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
"If you want to save your soul from Hell, a-ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today, or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies"

Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky

And they're coming after me

Ain't no grave

Well, look down yonder, Gabriel
Put your feet on the land and sea
But Gabriel, don't you blow your trumpet
Until you hear from me

There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

Well meet me, Jesus, meet me
Meet me in the middle of the air
And if these wings don't fail me
I will meet you anywhere

Ain't no grave

Can hold my body down

Well meet me, Mother and Father
Meet me down the river road
And Mama, you know that I'll be there

Can hold my body down

Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The Judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

Now the scaffold is high, and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd but she shed not a tear
But some times at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
I still miss someone
Oh, I never got over those blue eyes

I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is hard and steep
But beauteous fields arise before me
Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep
I'm going there to see my Mother

I'm just going over Jordan

Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights of town
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
'Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry

Soon your sugar daddies will all be gone
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me, but I'm gonna tell you, "Bye, bye, bye"
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry

You're gonna cry, cry, cry, and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten, and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no, and then you'll ask me, "Why, why, why?"
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry

You're gonna cry, cry, cry, and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

For two long years my head hurt bad
So the doctor checked me and he shook his head
He said, "I'm sorry to tell you but your body's outlived your brain"
He said, "I know this doctor in New York son
And he'll fix you up right with a brand new one"
So the head doctor met me when I stepped down off the train
He said, "We had this bank robber killed last night
His body's shot but his brain's alright
I'll give you a transplant boy, and it'll be okay"
I got my new brain in and I was feeling great
I went right back to Nashville with no headache
But something strange happened when I walked in the bank one day
I said "Stick 'em up everybody, I'm robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Don't nobody move and don't nobody reach for that door
A lady said, "Why, you're Johnny Cash!"
I said, "No ma'am, I'm the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York"
Now the other night, Roy Acuff called me
He said, "John, I'd like for you to do the Opry"
So I went out on the stage, but I couldn't sing
I got into half a verse of "I Walk The Line"
And something snapped in that head of mine
I yelled, "Stick 'em up! Gimme your money, your watches, and rings"
Well I called New York and talked to that brain quack
I said, "Doc, I've got to have my old brain back"
He said, "I'm sorry there Mr. Cash, but I can't do that"
He said, "I put your brain in a chicken last Monday
He singing your songs and making lots of money
And I got him signed to a ten year recording contract"
Now friends, if you see me walking down the street
Remember what you see ain't necessarily me
And if I try to hold you up, don't pay me no mind
But when you got ten bucks that you can blow
You ought to catch that Johnny Chicken Show
He's doin' fairs and concert dates all up and down the line

I said "Stick 'em up everybody, I'm robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Don't nobody move and don't nobody reach for that door
A lady said, "Why, you're Johnny Cash!"
I said, "No ma'am, I'm the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York"

Well, I don't pay any income tax
You don't pay tax on money you steal
But you ought to catch that Johnny Chicken Show
Chicken In Black
Mm...

Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from dragging me down
Gonna stand my ground, and I won't back down

Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
Hey, I will stand my ground, and I won't back down

Well, I know what's right, I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushing me around
But I stand my ground, and I won't back down

Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
Hey, I will stand my ground, and I won't back down

No, I won't back down

[Song 22: One Piece at a Time]
32 ContributorsOne Piece at a Time Lyrics
Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
And went to Detroit, working on assembly line
The first year, they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs
Every day, I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes, I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day, I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now, getting caught meant getting fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'd know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around

So the very next day, when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day, I got me a fuel pump
And the next day, I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts and bolts and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home
Now, up to now, my plan went alright
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts, all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help from an adaptor kit
We had that engine running just like a song
Now the headlights, they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch, all three of 'em come on
The back end looked kind of funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said, "Honey, take me for a spin"
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughing for blocks around
But up there at the courthouse, they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up, it took the whole staff
And when they got through, the title weighed sixty pounds

I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around

Uh, yeah, Red Ryder?
This is the Cotton Mouth in the Psycho-Billy Cadillac, come on
Huh? This is the Cotton Mouth
And negatory on the cost of this machine, there, Red Ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory and picked it up
It's cheaper that way
Uh, what model is it?
Well, it's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56, '57, '58, '59 automobile
It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67, '68, '69, '70 automobile

31 ContributorsI Hung My Head LyricsA Johnny Cash’s cover of Sting’s hit “I Hung My Head”, off American IV.
American IV: The Man Comes Around is the last studio album released by Cash when he was still alive.
Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead

I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head in my hands
The sheriff, he asked me
"Why had I run?"
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead

I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
"Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find"
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead

I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy
For soon I'll be dead

I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head

If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
If you were a carpenter
And I were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby
If a tinker was my trade
Would I still find you?
I'd be carrying the pots you made
Following behind you

Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow

If I were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color blouse
And your soft shoe shining?
If you were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
I'd not miss my color blouse
And my soft shoe shining

Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow

If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me?
I'd answered you, "Yes I would"
And would you not be above me
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby

Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow

Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more

You say you're looking for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothing more

Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean

I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching

15 ContributorsFurther On (Up the Road) LyricsTrack #5 of American V: A Hundred Highways (2006).
The song is a Johnny Cash’s version of Bruce Springsteen’s “Further On (Up the Road)” from the critical acclaimed album The Rising.
Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
Where the gun is cocked as the bullet's cold
Where the miles are marked in the blood and the gold
I'll meet you further on up the road
Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
My lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing
I got a song to sing, it keeps me out of the cold
And I'll meet you further on up the road

Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Where the way is dark and the night is cold
One sunny morning, we'll rise, I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road

Now I've been out in the desert, just doin' my time
Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign
If there's a light up ahead, well brother, I don't know
But I got this fever burnin' in my soul

Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
One sunny morning, we'll rise, I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road

[Song 28: Get Rhythm]
23 ContributorsGet Rhythm Lyrics
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and' roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

A little shoeshine boy he never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bending low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from getting the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
He popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all your trouble from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues


Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and' roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was going to jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a working that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a popping and he said again

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
But does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get the blues

I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench, an old man was sitting there
I said "Your old court house is kind of run down", he said
"Naw, it'll do for our little town"
I said "Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit"
And that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it
He said "Have a seat", and I sat down
"Is this the first time you've been to our little town?"
I said "I think it is", he said
"I don't like to brag
But we're kind of proud of that ragged old flag
You see, we got a little hole in that flag there
When Washington took it across the Delaware
And it got powder burned the night that Francis Scott Key
Sat watching it writin' "Say Can You See"
And it got a bad rip in New Orleans
With Packingham and Jackson tugging at its seams
And It almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the Texas flag but
She waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E. Lee, Beauregard and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag
On Flanders Field in World War I
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp, and low, a time or two
She was in Korea, Vietnam
She went where she was sent
By her Uncle Sam
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
And now they've about quit waving back here at home
In her own good land here she's been abused
She's been burned, dishonored, denied and refused
And the government for which she stands
Is scandalized throughout out the land
And she's gettin' thread bare, and she's wearing thin
But she's in good shape for the shape she's in
'Cause she's been through the fire before
And I believe she can take a whole lot more"
So we raise her up every morning
We take her down every night
We don't let her touch the ground and we fold her up right
On second thought, I do like to brag
'Cause I'm mighty proud of that ragged old flag

Like an orange bolt of lightning
Passing everything in sight
I'm the best pal the Duke boys' ever had
I'm thunder on the highway looking bad, bad, bad
I'm a knight
Like the kind in shining armor
With my polished body gleaming
I'm a fighter and a charmer
If trouble comes your way just ask for me
My friends all know me as the General Lee
I'm the General Lee
A piston pumpin' steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blowing red lights flashing everywhere
We'll cross the field and we'll be runnin' free
They'll eat dust with compliments of me
The General Lee
I'm a hero
And that's how I'll make you feel
When you're riding shotgun with me
And the law is at your heels
I'm glory bound and when the chase is done
I'll take off through the mountains and have fun, fun, fun

I've got style
Tearing through the curves
With my flag waving proudly to the people that I serve
I'm number 1 and I'll always be
The pride of the South they call the General Lee
I'm the General Lee
A piston pumpin' steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blowing red lights flashing everywhere
I'll jump that pond and we'll be running free
And they'll go swimming compliments of me

6 ContributorsCocaine Blues LyricsEarly one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head
Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Laid in the hot joints taking the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willie Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hop that shot your woman down
I said yes sir, my name is Willie Lee
If you got a warrant, just read it to me
Shot her down because she made me sorе
I thought I was her daddy but she had five morе
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on train and it took me back
I had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Got up next morning about a half past nine
Spied a sheriff coming down the line
Hopped and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, come on you dirty hop into that district court

Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before that jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered, lordy lordy, have mercy on me
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down
Come on you hops and listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be

Well, you're my friend
And can you see
Many times we've been out drinking
Many times we've shared our thoughts
But did you ever, ever notice
The kind of thoughts I got?
Well, you know I have a love
A love for everyone I know
And you know I have a drive
To live, I won't let go
But can you see its opposition
Comes rising up sometimes?
That its dreadful end-position
Comes blacking in my mind

And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
Did you know how much I love you?
Is a hope that somehow you
Can save me from this darkness

Well, I hope that someday, buddy
We have peace in our lives
Together or apart
Alone or with our wives
And we can stop our whoring
And pull the smiles inside
And light it up forever
And never go to sleep
My best unbeaten brother
This isn't all I see

Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Did you know how much I love you?
Is a hope that somehow you
Can save me from this darkness

A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home, Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said, "Your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down,"
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home, Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

"Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home, Bill
Don't take your guns to town,"

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself at last he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mother's words

"Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home, Bill
Don't take your guns to town,"

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered around
And wondered at his final words

"Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home, Bill
Don't take your guns to town,"

This is story song about a special kind of patriot.
Ira Hayes
Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Until the white man stole the water rights
And the sparkling water stopped
Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Ira Hayes returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance?

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Then Ira started drinking hard
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!
He died drunk early one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died

Sometimes it tries to kid me
That it's just a teddy bear
And even somehow manage to vanish in the air
And that is when I must beware of the beast in me

That everybody knows
They've seen him out dressed in my clothes
Patently unclear if it's New York or New Year
God help the beast in me

The beast in me

Well they're building a gallows outside my cell
And I've got 25 minutes to go
And the whole town's waiting just to hear me yell
I got 24 minutes to go
Well they gave me some beans for my last meal
With 23 minutes to go
But nobody asked me how I feel
I got 22 minutes to go
Well I sent for the Governor and the whole dern bunch
With 21 minutes to go
And I called up the mayor but he's out to lunch
I got 20 more minutes to go
Then the sheriff said boy I'm gonna watch you die
With 19 minutes to go
So I laughed in his face and I spit in his eye
With 18 minutes to go

Now here comes the preacher for to save my soul
With 13 minutes to go
And he's talking about burning, but I'm so cold
12 more minutes to go
Now they're testing the trap and it chills my spine
11 more minutes to go
And the trap and the rope aw they work just fine
With 10 more minutes to go
Well I'm waiting on the pardon that'll set me free
With 9 more minutes to go
But this is for real so forget about me
With 8 more minutes to go

With my feet on the trap and my head on the noose
5 more minutes to go
Won't somebody come and cut me loose
4 more minutes to go
I can see the mountains I can see the skies
With 3 more minutes to go
And it's too dern pretty for a man to don't want to die
With 2 more minutes to go
I can see the buzzards I can hear the crows
1 more minute to go
And now I'm swinging and here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

[Song 39: She Used To Love Me A Lot]
13 ContributorsShe Used To Love Me A Lot LyricsIt’s originally a song recorded by American country music artist David Allan Coe.
Cash’s version was brought up to light in 2014.
I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon Cafe
I started to keep going but something made me stop
She used to love me a lot
She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in and I'd give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot
I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said "where have you been? It's been a while"
She was glad to see me, I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said goodbye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

I remember how good it was back then
And I said "it's not too late to start again
We could spend the night together, take up where we left off"
She used to love me a lot

But I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
"Yes I'm in need of something, but something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot"

I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said goodbye
She just left me standing there, I've never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot

17 ContributorsThe Wreck of the Old ’97 LyricsThe song is about a real train wreck in 1903 when engineer Joseph (“Steve”) Broady was running the 97 line at high speed to stay on schedule between Monroe and Spencer, Virginia. The 97 ran “fast mail” and… Read More They gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia
Saying Steve you're way behind time
This is not 38 this is old 97
You must put her into Spencer on time
He turned around and said to his black greasy fireman
"Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Old Mountain
Watch old 97 roll"
And then a telegram came to Washington station
This is how it read:
It said, "That brave engineer that has run old 97
Is lying down in Danville, dead"
He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
So now all you pretty ladies you better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Don't you speak hard words to your true lover husband
He may leave you and never return

[Song 41: Hey Porter]
21 ContributorsHey Porter Lyrics
Hey porter, hey porter!
Would you tell me the time?
How much longer will it be 'til we cross
That Mason-Dixon Line?
At daylight, would ya tell that engineer
To slow it down?
Or better still, just stop the train
'cause I want to look around

Hey porter, hey porter!
What time did you say?
How much longer will it be 'til I
Can see the light of day?
When we hit Dixie, will you tell that engineer
To ring his bell?
And ask everybody that ain't asleep
To stand right up and yell

Hey porter, hey porter!
It's getting light outside
This old train is puffing smoke
And I have to strain my eyes
But ask that engineer if he
Will blow his whistle please
'Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves
And I feel that Southern breeze

Hey porter, hey porter!
Please get my bags for me
I need nobody to tell me now
That we're in Tennessee
Go tell that engineer to make
That lonesome whistle scream
We're not so far from home
So take it easy on the steam


Hey porter, hey porter!
Please open up the door
When they stop the train, I'm gonna get off first
'cause I can't wait no more
Tell that engineer I said thanks a lot
And I didn't mind the fare
I'm going to set my feet on Southern soil
And breathe that Southern air

Wanted man in California

Or Georgia by the sea
Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be
If you ever see me coming and if you know who I am
Don't you breathe it to nobody because you know I'm on the lamb
Wanted man by Lucy Watson
Wanted man by Jeannie Brown
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson
Wanted man in this next town
I've had all that I wanted of a lot of things I've had
And a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad
I got sidetracked in El Paso
Stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way in Juarez with Juanita on my lap
Went to sleep in Shreveport
Woke up in Abilene
Wondering why I'm wanted at some town half way in between
Wanted man in Albuquerque
Wanted man in Syracuse
Wanted man in Tallahassee
Wanted man in Baton Rouge
There's somebody set to grab me
Anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight
You might get a glimpse of me

Wanted man in California
Wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City
Wanted man in Ohio
Wanted man in Mississippi
Wanted man in old Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man

[Song 43: Give My Love to Rose]
22 ContributorsGive My Love to Rose LyricsAlthough the song originally appeared on Johnny Cash Sings Hank Williams, it is in fact, a Johnny Cash original.
I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said
He said, "They let me out of prison out in Frisco
For ten long years I paid for what I done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son"

"Give my love to Rose please, won't you, mister?
Take her all my money, tell her, "Buy some pretty clothes"
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose"

"Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
'Cause it ain't right that she should live alone
Mister, here's the bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now, don't forget to give my love to Rose"

"Give my love to Rose please, won't you, mister?
Take her all my money, tell her, "Buy some pretty clothes"
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose"

With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down

Some glad morning when this life is o'er
I'll fly away
To that home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh glory

When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To that land where joy will never end
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away

Oh, I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away

How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?

That's the only thing we got left that'll float
It's already over all the wheat and the oats
Two feet high and rising

How high's the water, mama?
Three feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Three feet high and rising

Well, the hives are gone
I've lost my bees
The chickens are sleeping
In the willow trees
Cow's in water up past her knees
Three feet high and rising

How high's the water, mama?
Four feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Four feet high and rising

Hey, come look through the window pane
The bus is coming, it's going to take us to the train
Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain
Four feet high and rising

How high's the water, mama?
Five feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Five feet high and rising

Well, the rails are washed out north of town
We got to head for higher ground
We can't come back till the water comes down
Five feet high and rising
Well its five feet high and rising

[Song 48: Dark as the Dungeon (At Folsom Prison)]
14 ContributorsDark as the Dungeon (At Folsom Prison) LyricsOh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Until the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day...
(Ha ha, no laughing during this song please... It's being recorded, I know. Hell, don't you know it's recorded?)
...Like a friend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
"Thank you very much, thank you very much. I'm sorry about that little interruption there, but I just want to tell you that this show is being recorded for an album release on Columbia Records and you can't say 'hell' or 'shit' or anything like that. How's that grab you, Bob?"

Hey, look a-yonder comin'

And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy
And get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues

"Say man, when you going back to Florida?"
"When am I goin' back to Florida? I don't know, don't reckon I ever will."
"Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?"
"Well, I don't care if I do-die-do-die-do-die-do-die."

Hey talk about a-ramblin'
She's the fastest train on the line
Talk about a-travellin'
She's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Rollin' down the seaboard line

Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses fallin'
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide
But come yet back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so
But if you come, when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an "ave" there for me
And I will know, though soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me
And I will rest in peace until you come to me

[Song 51: Rock Island Line]
18 ContributorsRock Island Line Lyrics
Now this here's a story about the Rock Island Line
Well, the Rock Island Line, she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there, and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well, you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well, a train driver, he pulled up to the tollgate
And the man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said

I got livestock
I got livestock
I got cows
I got pigs
I got sheep
I got mules
I got all livestock

Well, he said, "You're alright, boy, you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through," so he went on through the tollgate
And as he went through, he started picking up a little bit of speed
Picking up a little bit of steam
He got on through, he turned and looked back at the man he said

Well, I fooled you
I fooled you
I got pig iron
I got pig iron
I got all pig iron

Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line, it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road
Well, if you ride it, you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

Looked cloudy in the west and it looked like rain
'Round the curve come a passenger train
North bound train on a southbound track
He's alright a-leaving, but he won't be back

Well, the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line, it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road
Well, if you ride it, you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

Oh, I may be right and I may be wrong
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well, the engineer said before he died
That there were two more drinks that he'd like to try
Conductor said, "What could they be?"
A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea

Well, the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line, it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road
Well, if you ride it, you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Song 52: My Grandfather’s Clock]
7 ContributorsMy Grandfather’s Clock LyricsMy grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short, never to go again
When the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short, never to go again
When the old man died
My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound
And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped, short, never to go again
When the old man died
It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come
Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped, short, never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short, never to go again
When the old man died

As I walked out on Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
All wrapped in white linen, as cold as the clay
Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong"
Then go write a letter, and send it ti my gray haired mother
And please send the same to my sister so dear
But please not one word of all this would you mention
If my mother should as for my story to hear
There is another more dear than a sister
She'll bitterly weep
And if some other man ever wins her affection
Don't mention my name and my name will pass on
"Just beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong"
Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Six dance-hall maidens to sing me a song
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin
Roses to deaden the clods when they fall

"We beat the drum slowly, we play the Fife lowly
We bitterly wept as we bore him along
Down in the green valley, we lay the sod o'er him
He was a young cowboy and we know he'd done wrong
First to the card-house and then down to Rose's
And there stands his marker we made to this day

[Song 54: Big Iron]
9 ContributorsBig Iron LyricsTo the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came ridin' from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
He was an Arizona Ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from their windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
Was about to meet his death

There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
The big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
The big iron on his hip

Belinda was mine until the time that I found her
Holdin' Jim
And loving him
Then Sue came along, loved me strong, that's what I thought
Me and Sue
But that died, too
Don't know that I will but until I can find me
A girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
A solitary man

I've had it to here - being where love's a small word
A part time thing
A paper ring
I know it's been done having one girl who loved me
Right or wrong
Weak or strong


Don't know that I will but until love can find me
And a girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
A solitary man

I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people, that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud

Daddy sang bass, mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm going to join the family circle at the throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass, mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But, I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

Daddy sang bass, mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
'Cause singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm going to join the family circle at the throne
Oh no, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass, mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

[Song 57: (Ghost) Rider in the Sky]
5 Contributors(Ghost) Rider in the Sky LyricsAn old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry
Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay
Ghost Riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies
Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay

Ghost Riders in the sky
Ghost Riders in the sky
Ghost Riders in the sky

It all began when they took me from my home
And put me on Death Row
A crime for which I am totally innocent, you know

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

I hear stories from the chamber
Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
He died upon the cross
Might I say, it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told
My kill-hand's
Tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist
In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold
It's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away
Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hopin'
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief
A life for a life
And a truth for a truth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way that's helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lie

I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got another journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me want to stay
And my one regret is leaving you behind

But if it proves to be His will that I am first to cross
And somehow I've a feeling it will be
When it comes your time to travel likewise, don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see

And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow water, reaching for your hand

Through this life we've laboured hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes

So I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come, then we'll see paradise

And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow water, reaching for your hand

I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow water, reaching for your hand, hmm

I've wept for those who suffer long
But how I weep for those who've gone
Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong
But keep on killing
It's in the soul to feel such things
But weak to watch without speaking
Oh what mercy sadness brings
If God be willing

There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

Fire rages in the streets
And swallows everything it meets
It's just an image often seen
On television
Come leaders, come you men of great
Let us hear you pontificate
Your many virtues laid to waste
And we aren't listening

There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

What do you have for us today
Throw us a bone but save the plate
On why we waited until so late
Was there no oil to excavate
No riches in trade for the fate
Of every person who died in hate
Throw us a bone, you men of great

There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

It's buried in the countryside
It's exploding in the shells at night
It's everywhere a baby cries
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

A picking, singing folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall
Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist
This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage
Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license
Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered
To hear the folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear said, "Oh dear"
Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixing politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions
Keep them to yourself
Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
And the guy in the rear got drafted

[Song 62: The Ballad of Boot Hill]
11 ContributorsThe Ballad of Boot Hill Lyrics
Here lies Les Moore
Four slugs from a .44
No less, no more

Out in Arizona, just south of Tucson
Where tumbleweeds tumble in search of a home
There's a town they call Tombstone where the brave never cry
They live by a sixgun, by a sixgun they die
It's been a long time now since the town was a boom
The jailhouse is empty, so's the Palace Saloon
Just one look will tell you that this town was real
A secluded old dirt road leads up to Boot Hill
Walk up to the fence there and look at the view
That's where they were hanging, 1882
It's easy to see where the brave men have died
Rope marks on the oak tree are now petrified
At night when the moon shines so far away
It gets mighty lonesome looking down on their graves
There lies Billy Clanton, never wanted to kill
But he's there with the guilty way up on Boot Hill

Boot Hill

[Song 63: So Doggone Lonesome]
15 ContributorsSo Doggone Lonesome Lyrics
I do my best to hide this lowdown feeling
I try to make believe there's nothing wrong
But they're always asking me about you, darling
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone

If they ask me, I guess, I'd be denying
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart, they'd hear it crying
"Where's my darling, when's she coming home?"

I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
Well, I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining through
And then I get so doggone lonesome

Time stands still when you're a-waiting
Sometimes I think my heart is stopping too
One lonely hour seems forever
Sixty minutes more to wait for you

But I guess I'll keep waiting 'til you're with me
'Cause I believe that loving you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
If I can't have you with me tonight

Well, I know I'll keep on loving you cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind, but I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others, but I know I'd love you still
'Сause I get so doggone lonesome

[Song 64: A Thing Called Love]
13 ContributorsA Thing Called Love Lyrics
Six foot six he stood on the ground
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love
He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
Because of love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
That's stronger than love

Most men are like me, they struggle and doubt
They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with living to worry about
A little word like love
But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I thank God that the world's been blessed
With a thing called love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
That's stronger than love

There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
In my life, I love you more

I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been riding on a Tennessee stud
Had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud
Drifted on down into no man's land
I crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's foe
'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud
I rode right back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and I whipped her Pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was riding on a Tennessee mare
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little horse colt playing 'round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud

12 ContributorsDelia’s Gone Lyrics“Delia’s Gone” is one of several traditional song versions about the murder of Delia Green, who was shot on Christmas Eve, 1900 by 15-year-old Mose Houston. It was recorded four times by Johnny Cash.

Delia, oh, Delia
Delia all my life
If I hadn't have shot poor Delia
I'd have had her for my wife
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
I went up to Memphis
And I met Delia there
Found her in her parlor
And I tied her to her chair
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
She was low down and trifling
And she was cold and mean
Kind of evil make me want to
Grab my sub machine
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
First time I shot her
I shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

But jailer, oh, jailer
Jailer, I can't sleep
'Cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
So if you woman's devilish
You can let her run
Or you can bring her down and do her
Like Delia got done
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

(Prettiest girl we've ever seen)

There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
How those eyes could flash at you
(How those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung around her by the score
But she loved the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(Prettiest girl we've ever seen)

She was tops in all they said
It never once went to her head
She had everything it seems
Not a care, this teenage queen
(Not a care, this teenage queen)
Other boys could offer more
But she loved the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(You should be a movie queen)

He would marry her next spring
Saved his money, bought a ring
Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out
(Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door
Working at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(See you on the movie screen)

Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town
(But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(Saddest girl we've ever seen)

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train
(Left it all and caught a train)
Do I have to tell you more
She came back to the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store

(Now this story has some more
You'll hear it all at the candy store)

[Song 69: What Is Truth]
14 ContributorsWhat Is Truth Lyrics
The old man turned off the radio
Said, "Where did all of the old songs go?"
"Kids sure play funny music these days!"
"They play it in the strangest ways."
Said, "It looks to me like they've all gone wild."
"It was peaceful back when I was a child"
Well, man, could it be that the girls and boys
Are trying to be heard above your noise?
And the lonely voice of youth cries
"What is truth?"

A little boy of three sitting on the floor
Looks up and says, "Daddy, what is war?"
"Son, that's when people fight and die."
The little boy of three says, "Daddy, why?"
A young man of seventeen in Sunday school
Being taught the golden rule
And by the time another year has gone around
It may be his turn to lay his life down
Can you blame the voice of youth for asking
"What is truth?"

A young man sitting on the witness stand
The man with the book says - "Raise your hand!"
"Repeat after me, I solemnly swear"
The man looked down at his long hair
And although the young man solemnly swore
Nobody seems to hear anymore
And it didn't really matter if the truth was there
It was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair
And the lonely voice of youth cries
"What is truth?"

The young girl dancing to the latest beat
Has found new ways to move her feet
The young man speaking in the city square
Is trying to tell somebody that he cares
Yeah, the ones that you're calling wild
Are going to be the leaders in a little while
This old world's waking to a new born day
And I solemnly swear that it'll be their way
You better help the voice of youth find
What is truth?

And the lonely voice of youth cries
What is truth?

There are some people who say we cannot tell
Whether we are saved or whether all is well
They say we only can hope and trust that it is so
Well, I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (Saved my soul)
The very moment He forgave me (Made me whole)
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within (Peace within)
Satan can't make me doubt it (I won't doubt it)
It's real and I'm gonna shout it (I'm gonna shout it)
I was there when it happened a
And so I guess I ought to know

I don't care who tells me salvation is not real
Though the world may argue that we cannot feel
The heavy burden's lifted and the vile sins go
I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (Saved my soul)
The very moment He forgave me (Made me whole)
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within (Peace within)
Satan can't make me doubt it (I won't doubt it)
It's real and I'm gonna shout it (I'm gonna shout it)
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know

On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

I told the undertaker
"Undertaker, please drive slow
For this body you are hauling
How I hate to see her go"

Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

Heaven help me be a man
And have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

You ask me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will every day
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll find another
I don't know, I can't say
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

Saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
I asked if I could have one when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs and she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
My very first pistol was a cap-and-ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
It loads a mite slow and I soon found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
Then I went and bought myself a Colt .45
Called a Peacemaker but I didn't know why
I never knew why and I didn't understand
'Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
I never knew why, I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

I got into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating and I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
You been out riding fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasing you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the things that you can't get

Desperado, oh, you aren't getting any younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're driving you home
And freedom, oh freedom
Well, that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking
Through this world all alone

And don't your feet get cold in the winter time
The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Isn't it funny how the feeling
Goes away

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences, and open the gate
It may be raining, but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late

Another guy gives you the eye and there you go

There you go, you're gone again
I should have known I couldn't win
There you go, you're by his side
You're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie

Because I love you so I take much more than I should take
I want you even though I know my heart is gonna break
You build me up and for a while I'm all aglow
Then your fickle heart sees someone else and there you go

There you go, you're gone again

There you go, you're by his side
You're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie

[Song 76: The Legend of John Henry’s Hammer]
12 ContributorsThe Legend of John Henry’s Hammer Lyrics
John Henry's Papy woke him up one midnight
He said before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you, listen boy
Said learn to ball a jack, learn to lay a track, learn to pick and shovel too, and take my hammer, it'll do anything you tell it to
John Hery's mammie had about a dozen babies, John Henry's papie told tale about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money, he said I'll pay you quarter at a time, startin' tomorow, that's the pay for a steel driver on this line
Then the section foreman said hey hammer swinger, I see you brought your own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do?
And he said, I can turn a jack, I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too
(can you swing a hammer boy?)
Yes sir, I'll do anything you hire me to
Now ain't you something so high and mighty with your muscles, just go ahead pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer
He said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do
With a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a day for driven steel
(sweat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings)
I was born for driven steel
Well John Henry hammered in the mountain, he'd give a grunt and he'd give groan with every swing, the women folks for miles around, heard him and come down, to watch him make the cold steel ring, Lord what a swinger, just listen to that cold steel ring
But the bad boss come up laughing at John Henry, said you full of vinegar now, but you bout through, were gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin, then what's all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry, gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you
John Henry said I feed four little brothers, and my baby sister's walking on her knees, did the Lord say that machines awtta take the place of living, and what's a subsitute for bread and beans, I ain't seen it, do engines get rewarded for their steam
John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner now, had thirty minutes to rest before the bell, the mine boss hollered get up whoever you are and get a pick ax, give me enough coal to start another hill, and keep it burning, mine me enough to start another hill
John Henry said to his captain, a man ain't nothin but a man, but if you bring that steam drill round, I'll beat it fair and honest, I'll die with my hammer in my hand, but I'll be laughing, cuz you can't replace a steel driven man
There was a big crowd of people at the mountain, John Henry said to the steam drill how is you, pardon me mister steam drill, I suppose you didn't hear me, I said how you, well can you turn a jack, can you lay a track, can you pick and shovel too, listen this hammer swingers talkin' to you
2000 people hollered go John Henry, then somebody hollered the mountain's caving in, John Henry told the captain, tell the kind folks not to worry, that ain't nothin but my hammer suckin' wind, keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle I intend
Captain tell the people move back further, I'm at the finish line and I ain't no drill, she's so far behind you ain't got the brains to quit it, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills, Lord Lordy, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills
Well John Henry had a little woman, I believe the lady's name was Polly Ann, yeah that was his good woman, John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home, he layed down to rest his weary back and early next morining he said come here Polly Ann come here sugar, ya know I believe this is the first time I ever watched the sun come up that I couldn't come up with it
Take my hammer Polly Ann and go to that rail road, swing that hammer like you seen me do it, and when your swinging with the lead men, they'll all know they'll all know your John Henry's woman, but tell them that's not all I can do, tell em I can hoist a jack, and I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too, ain't no machine can, that's been proved to you
There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house, the section hands laid him in the sand, trains go by on the rails John Henry laid, they slow down and take off their hats, the men do, when they come to the place where John Henry's laid, rests on his back, some say mornin steel driver you sure were a hammer swinger, then they go along pickin up speed, clickty clack, clickty clack, down there lies a steel driven man oh Lord, down there lies a steel driven man, down there lies a steel driven man oh Lord, down there lies a steel driven man

[Song 77: Father and Son]
4 ContributorsFather and Son Lyrics
It's not time to make a change
Just relax and take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

How can I try to explain
When I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, the same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
There's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go

It's not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

All the times that I cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
If they were right, I'd agree
But it's them you know not me
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go

Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a Robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That means he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry


The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Song 79: Highway Patrolman]
13 ContributorsHighway Patrolman Lyrics
My name is Joe Roberts, I work for the state
I'm a sergeant out on Perenville barracks number 8
I've always done an honest job, honest as I could
Got a brother named Frankie, Frankie isn't no good
Well, ever since we were young kids, it's been the same come down
I'd get a call on the short wave, Frankie's in trouble downtown
Well, if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away
But sometimes when it's your brother, you look the other way

Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played "The Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's straying, like any brother should
Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no good

Well, Frankie went into the army back in 1965
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife
But them wheat prices kept on dropping, until it was like we's getting robbed
Frankie came home in '68, and me, I took this job

Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played "The Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's straying, teach him how to walk that line
Man turns his back on his family, ain't no friend of mine


The night was like any other, I got a call about a quarter to nine
There was trouble at a roadhouse out on the Michigan line
There was a kid on the floor, looking bad, bleeding hard from his head
There was a girl crying at a table, "It was Frankie," she said
I ran out and I jumped in my car, then I hit the lights
I must have done about a hundred and ten to Michigan County that night
It was down by the crossroads, out by Willow Bank
Seen the Buick with Ohio plates, behind the wheel was Frank
Well, I chased him through them county roads, until the sign said Canadian border five miles from here
Pulled over to the side out the highway, watched the taillights disappear

Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played "The Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's straying, like any brother should
Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no good

When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all

And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls, so hard
I will comfort you

I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on, silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come, to shine
All your dreams are on their way

See how they shine
Oh, If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind

[Song 81: The Cremation of Sam McGee]
6 ContributorsThe Cremation of Sam McGee LyricsThere are strange things done in the midnight sun
By the men that toil for gold
The Arctic trails have their secret tales
That would make your blood run cold
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights
But the queerest they ever did see
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
That I cremated Sam McGee
Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows
Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows
He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell
Though he'd often say in his homely way, "I'd sooner live in hell."
On a Christmas Day, we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail
You talk of your cold! Through the parka's fold, it stabbed like a driven nail
If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze 'til sometimes we couldn't see
It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee
And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow
And the dogs were fed, and the stars overhead were dancing heel and toe
He turned to me, and "Cap," says he, "I'll cash in this trip, I guess
And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request."
Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of a moan:
"It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold 'til I'm chilled clean through to the bone
Yet it ain't being dead - it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains."

Well, a pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail
And we started on at the break of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale
And he crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee
And before nightfall, a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee
With a corpse half-hid that I couldn't get rid, I hurried, horror-driven
There wasn't a breath in that land of death and because of a promise given
It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say, "You may tax your brawn and brains
But you promised true and it's up to you to cremate my last remains."
Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code
In the days to come, though my lips were numb, in my heart, how I cursed that load
In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, 'round in a ring
Howled out their woes to the homeless snows - O God! how I loathed that thing
And every day, that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow
And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low
And the trail was bad, and I felt half-mad, but I swore I would not give in
And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin
'til I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;
It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a thrice it was called the "Alice May."
And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum
Then, "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my crematorium."
Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire
Some coal I found that was lying 'round, and I heaped the fuel higher
Well, the flames just soared and the furnace roared - such a blaze you never did see
And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee

Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so
And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow
It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why
And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky
I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear
But the stars came out and they danced about before I ventured near
I was sick with dread, but I bravely said, "I'll just take a peek inside
I guess he's cooked and it's time I looked," then the door I opened wide
And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar
And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said, "Please close that door
It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm
And since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, this is the first time I've been warm."
There are strange things done in the midnight sun
By the men that toil for gold
The Arctic trails have their secret tales
That would make your blood run cold
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights
But the queerest they ever did see
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
That I cremated Sam McGee

I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at
Got the number "Thirteen" tattooed on my neck
When the ink starts to itch, then the black will turn to red

Never had me a name
They just gave me the number when I was young

Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well
The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell
Bad luck wind been blowing at my back

I was born in the soul of misery
Never had me a name

I ride an old paint, I lead an old Dan
I'm off to Montan' for to throw the hooley-ann
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw

Ride around, little dogies, ride around slow
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go

Bill Jones had two daughters and a song
One went to Denver, the other went wrong
His young wife died in a pool room fight
But he tries to keep singing from morning 'til night

Ride around, little dogies, ride around slow
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go

When I die, take my saddle from the wall
Strap it on my pony, lead him out of the stall
Throw my bones on his back, turn our faces to the west
And we'll ride the prairie that we love the best

Ride around, little dogies, ride around slow
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go

But the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Staring at the wall

In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Namin' their wedding day
Namin' their wedding day
As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm going to be the first
I'm going to be the first
Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Because there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall

Well there's never been a man who shook this camp
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide
I know it was suicide

[Song 86: Tennessee Flat-Top Box]
13 ContributorsTennessee Flat-Top Box Lyrics
In a little cabaret in a south Texas border town
Sat a boy and his guitar and the people came from all around
And all the girls from there to Austin
Were slipping away from home and puttin' jewelry in hock
To take the trip, to go and listen
To the little dark-haired boy that played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle and he never cared to make a dime
But give him his guitar and he'd be happy all the time
And all the girls from nine to ninety
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him don't stop
And hypnotized and fascinated
By the little dark-haired boy that played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Then one day he was gone and no one ever saw him 'round
He'd vanished like the breeze and they forgot him in the little town
But all the girls still dreamed about him
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked
And then one day on the Hit Parade
Was a little dark-haired boy that played a Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

We sailed on the ship John B, my grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night, got into a fight

So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, I feel so homesick I want to go home

The first mate, he got drunk, broke up the people's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone, why don't you leave me alone?
Well, I feel so homesick I wanted to go home
Then the cook, he caught the fits, threw out all of my grits
Then he took and ate up all of my corn
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, this is the worst trip since I have been born

So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, I feel so homesick I want to go home

And then sweeping up to glory

Where rivers of delight shall ever roll

Come all you rounders if you wanna hear
The story about a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the roller's name
On a 6-8 wheeler course he rode to fame
Caller called Casey about half past four
He kissed his wife at the station door
He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said, "This is the trip to the Promised Land"

Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leaning out the window
Taking a trip to the Promised Land

Through South Memphis Yards on a fly
Rain been a-falling and the water was high
Everybody knew by the engine's moan
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
Well, Jones said, "Fireman, don't you fret"
Sim Webb said, "I ain't a-giving up yet"
We're eight hours late with the southbound mail
Be on time or we're leaving the rails

Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leaning out the window
Taking a trip to the Promised Land

Dead on the rail was a passenger train
Blood was a-boiling in Casey's brain
Casey said, "Hey, look out ahead
Sim, jump, Sim, jump or we'll all be dead"
With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake
North Mississippi was wide awake
IC Railroad official said
"He's a good engineer to be a-laying dead"

Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leaning out the window
Taking a trip to the Promised Land

Headaches and heartaches and all kind of pain
Are all a part of a railroad train
Sweat and toil, the good and the grand
Are part of the life of a railroad man

Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leaning out the window
Taking a trip to the Promised Land

It's midnight at a liquor store in Texas
Closing time another day is done
When a boy walked in the door and points a pistol
He can't find a job, but Lord, he's found a gun
He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
Then he lets the old man run out in the street
Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazing
Already he can feel a great relief

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

He pictures the arrival of the cruisers
Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
He knows that when they're shooting at this loser
They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

The evening news carried all the details
He dies in every living room in town
In his own a bottle's thrown in anger
And his father cries, he'll never live this down

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

You can see it in the movies and the paper and the TV news
Somebody's army is always on the move
There's going to be a battle the lines have been drawn
They have got guns and tanks and planes
The wells are gone dry and the water is bad and the air is acid rain
There's war after war and rumors of war from the east
There's a rumbling in the ground and they are talking about the beast
Good mothers cry cause the rivers run high
With the blood of too many sons
Some people say peace is on the way
But the worst is still to come

Because the prophets wrote about it
And Jesus spoke about it
And John got to take a look
And he told us what he saw when it's easy to see
It's going by the book

There's armies in the cities and the missiles stand ready for flight
A pale horse rides like the wind across the night
And that rumbling in the desert like thunder getting closer
Are the trumpet's getting ready to blow
There's going to be a shout that will wake the dead we better be ready to go

Took them twenty-five years to welcome me back

Many a good man I saw fall
And even now, every time I dream
I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream

Drive on, it don't mean nothing
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man, drive on
It don't mean nothing, drive on
I remember one night, Tex and me
Rappelled in on a hot L.Z
We had our 16's on rock and roll
But with all that fire, I was scared and cold

I was crazy and I was wild
And I have seen the tiger smile
I spit in a bamboo viper's face
And I'd be dead but by God's grace

Drive on, it don't mean nothing
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man, drive on
It don't mean nothing, it don't mean nothing, drive on

It was a real slow walk in a sad rain
And nobody tried to be John Wayne
I came home but Tex did not
And I can't talk about the hit he got

But I got a little limp now when I walk
And I got a little tremolo when I talk
But my letter read from Whiskey Sam
You're a walking, talking miracle from Vietnam

Drive on, it don't mean nothing
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man, drive on
It don't mean nothing, it don't mean nothing, drive on

Everybody take a look, see I'm doing fine
Then load my box on the 309


Hey sweet baby, kiss me hard
Draw my bath water, sweep my yard
Give a drink of my wine to my Jersey cow
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for my journey now
On the 309, on the 309
I hear the sound of a railroad train
The whistle blows and I'm gone again
It will take me higher than a Georgia pine
Stand back children, it's a 309


A chicken in the pot and turkey in the corn
Ain't felt this good since jubilee morn
Talk about luck, well I got mine
Asthma coming down like a 309
Write me a letter, sing me a song
Tell me all about it, what I did wrong
Meanwhile I will be doing fine
Then load my box on the 309

Jim, Jim
I wore a tie today
The first that I ever wore
You have said that I look like a dummy
Out of a dry goods store

Oh, Jim, Jim, the preacher said a lot of things
But I didn't hear a word he said
My mind kept wandering
Back down the trail
Back to the good times we had

Riding herd through the sun and the rain
Panning for gold on the cuff
We did everything in the books, I guess
And a lot that they never thought up

Oh, Jim, Jim, so you're riding on ahead
Well, if that's how it's going to be
When you reach those streets paved with gold
Jim, take a claim out for me

We did everything we could do for ya, Jim
But your fever just wouldn't go down

So we put you on a wagon, Jim
And this morning we got you back to town

But when we got here, you were gone, Jim
And there wasn't anything anybody could do

They dressed you up in a fancy suit and a necktie
And so, today, we wore one too

Riding herd through the sun and the rain
Panning for gold on the cuff
We've did everything in the book I guess
And a lot that they never thought up
Oh Jim, Jim, so you're riding on ahead
Well if that's how its going to be
When you reach those streets paved with gold
Jim, stake a claim out for me

[Song 98: Cocaine Carolina]
5 ContributorsCocaine Carolina Lyrics
Morning found me lying on a floor in New Orleans
Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans
Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina
Met her on an ocean liner, called her Cocaine Carolina
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two
God knows how much I adored her, I just never could afford her
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

So goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky
Lexington was famous for it's bluegrass and its hills
Carolina, we should get up, don't you know we'll have to split up?
Maybe I should go to California

So goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

So goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?
Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?
Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money

I was all torn up and nervous cause I knew that you'd be gone
I knocked and crossed my fingers while I waited
And I couldn't hold the teardrops when I walked away alone
It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go
I'd been runnin' 'round in circles like a baby
I was in a daze because I loved you so, I couldn't see
I was broken in a million little pieces
When I saw enough to realize, you didn't care for me
It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, so forget her
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go, let her go, boy
Let her go

The first time ever I saw your face, I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless sky, my love
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move through my hands
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command
And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I know our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love

The first time ever I saw your face

[Song 101: Country Boy]
14 ContributorsCountry Boy Lyrics
Country boy, ain't got no shoes
Country boy, ain't got no blues

Well, you work all day
While you're wanting to play
In the sun and the sand
With a face that's tan
But at the end of the day
When your work is done
You ain't got nothing but fun

Country boy, ain't got no ills
Country boy, don't owe no bills

You get a wiggly worm
And then you watch him squirm
While you put him on a hook
And then you drop him in a brook
And if everything's gonna turn out right
You're gonna fry fish tonight

Country boy, you're lucky free
Country boy, I wish I was you and you was me


Country boy, got work to do
Country boy, in the morning dew

You got to cut the weeds
You got to plant the seeds
There's many a row
You know you gotta hoe
But when it's quittin' time
And your work is through
There's a lot of life in you

Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
Country boy, up a holler log

Well, he comes in a run
When you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two
And your dog and you
When you get your rabbit
You'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried

Country boy, you got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes

From the feet it came down and ran to the ground
Between heaven and hell, a teardrop fell
In the deep crimson dew, the tree of life grew

And the blood gave life to the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price that set the captives free
And the numbers that came through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree and were redeemed by the blood
From the tree streamed a light that started the fight
'Round the tree grew a vine on whose fruit I could dine
My old friend Lucifer came, fought to keep me in chains
But I saw through the tricks of six-sixty-six

And the blood gave life to the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price that set the captives free
And the numbers that came through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree and were redeemed by the blood
From his hands it came down, from his side it came down
From his feet it came down and ran to the ground
And a small inner voice said "you do have a choice"
The vine engrafted me and I clung to the tree

He hadn't cried for years and for years
Napalmed babies and movie love stories
For instance, could not produce tears
As a child he had cried as all children will
Then at some point, his tear ducts ran dry
Grew to be a man, it all hit the fan
Things got bad but he couldn't cry
His dog was run over, his wife up and left him
After that he got sacked from his job
Lost his arm in a war, was laughed at by a whore
Ah, but still not a sniffle or sob
His novel was refused and his movie was panned
His big Broadway show was a flop
He got sent off to jail, you guessed it, no bail
Oh, but still not a dribble or drop
In jail he was beaten, bullied and buggered
And made to make license plates
Water and bread was all he was fed
Not once did a tear stain his face
Doctors were called in, scientists too
Theologians were last and practically least
They all agreed sure enough, this was no cream puff
But in fact an insensitive beast
He was taken from jail and placed in a place
For the insensitive and the insane
He made a lot of friends and he played a lot of chess
And he wept every time it would rain
Once it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
And he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried
On the forty-first day, he passed away
He just dehydrated and died
He went up to heaven, located his dog
After that, he rejoined his arm
Below, all the critics, they took it all back
Cancer robbed the whore of her charm
His ex-wife died of stretch marks, his ex-employer went broke
The theologians were finally found out
Right down to the ground, the old jailhouse burned down
And the earth suffered perpetual drought

Just around the corner there's heartache
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues

I walk and cry while my heartbeat
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
The sun never shines through this window of mine
It's dark at the Home of the Blues

Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest memories
Memories so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die

So if you just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me, misery loves company
You're welcome at the Home of the Blues

Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest memories
Memories so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die

Just around the corner there's heartache
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues

Yeah, you're gonna find me at the Home of the Blues

[Song 105: If I Told You Who It Was]
11 ContributorsIf I Told You Who It Was Lyrics
I was down in music city 'bout a week ago
I wanted to see the brand old Loper show
So I held a cap and I headed down to Opryland
They said they sold their last ticket the day before
So I kinda just hung around the backstage door
And down the steps she came, man oh man
My favourite female country star
She waved her fans and headed for her car
Her tire, unlike her body, was very flat
She said, could you change my tire
I said your wish is my desire
As she raised the lid, I grabbed her bumper jack
She said I sure do appreciate you changing my tire

If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
You'd think I was making it up
She said it was our little secret and by golly
I'm gonna keep it
Anyway you wouldn't believe it
If I told you who it was

She said you need a lift and I said well
You can drop me of at the York motel
So we headed down Briley parkway in the town
I told her I got all your records ma'am
She smiled and said well I be damned
She said, you're kind of cute fella, wanna mess around
When we got to my room just the people lied
I said sure wish I could've heard you sing tonight
She smiled at me and said what do you wanna hear?
Well if I was one of them country music folks
I'll tell you, she'd sure get my vote for the best performance of the year

If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
You'd think I was making it up
She said it was our little secret and by golly
I'm gonna keep it
Anyway you wouldn't believe it
If I told you who it was

Well I tell you this much
When I put my arms around her and squeezed her real tight
She looked up at me with those big beautiful eyes
Took a deep breath and a sigh and said:
"Howdy I'm just so proud to be here!"

If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
You'd think I was making it up
She said it was our little secret and by golly
I'm gonna keep it
Anyway you wouldn't believe it
If I told you who it was

[Song 108: As Long As the Grass Shall Grow]
11 ContributorsAs Long As the Grass Shall Grow Lyrics
As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow

The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquois nation
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line, you'll find their reservation
After the US Revolution, Cornplanter was a chief
He told the tribe these men they could trust, that was his true belief
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land

As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow

On the Seneca reservation, there is much sadness now
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how
Across the Allegheny River, they're throwing up a dam
It will flood the Indian country, a proud day for Uncle Sam
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin
It will drown the Indian graveyards, Cornplanter can you swim?
The earth is mother to the Senecas, they're trampling sacred ground
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down

As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow

The Iroquois Indians used to rule from Canada way south
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way
They laughed in his face and said no deal, Kinzua Dam is here to stay
Congress turned the Indians down, brushed off the Indian's plea
So the Senecas have renamed the dam, they call it Lake Perfidy

As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow

Washington, Adams, and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring
The treaties are safe, we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling?
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake, it's rising all the time
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy, in winter it will fill
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow
The father of our country must be wrong, what's an Indian anyhow?

As long as the moon shall rise (Look up)
As long as the rivers flow (Are you thirsty?)
As long as the sun will shine (My brother, are you warm?)
As long as the grass shall grow

If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains around my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as there's a ghost that you can't see

If I could read your mind, love
What a tale your thoughts would tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstores sell
When you reached the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
You won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take!

I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back

If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
If you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just trying to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back

Anyway, this song was written by our friend Glen Sherley, and... (applause) I hope I do your song justice, Glen Sherley. We'll do our best..."

Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free

There's a grey stone chapel here at Folsom
A house of worship in this den of sin
You wouldn't think that God had a place here at Folsom
But he saved the soul of many lost men
Now this grey stone chapel here at Folsom
Stands a hundred years old made of granite rock
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom
But the door to the house of God is never locked

Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free

There are men here that don't ever worship
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray
But I've got down on my knees in that grey stone chapel
And I've thanked the Lord for helping me each day
Now this grey stone chapel here at Folsom
It has a touch of God's hand on every stone
It's a flower of light in a field of darkness
And it's given me the strength to carry on

Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free

Don’t call my name out your window, I’m leaving

Don’t send your kinfolk to give me no talking

That you be saying all along
Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut
Till I’m gone
Don’t give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan
Understand your man
I'm tired of your bad mouthing
Understand your man
Now, you can give my other suit to the Salvation Army
And everything else I leave behind
I ain't taking nothing that'll slow down my traveling
While I'm untangling my mind
I ain't going to repeat what i said anymore
While I'm breathing air that ain't been breathed before
I'll be as gone to as a wild goose in winter
Then you'll understand your man
Meditate on it
Understand your man
You hear me talking now
Understand your man
Remember what i told ya

Come all you rounders if you wanna hear
The story about a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the roller's name
On a 6-8 wheeler course he rode to fame
Caller called Casey about half past four
He kissed his wife at the station door
He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said, "This is the trip to the Promised Land"

Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leaning out the window
Taking a trip to the Promised Land

Through South Memphis Yards on a fly
Rain been a-falling and the water was high
Everybody knew by the engine's moan
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
Well, Jones said, "Fireman, don't you fret"
Sim Webb said, "I ain't a-giving up yet"
We're eight hours late with the southbound mail
Be on time or we're leaving the rails

Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leaning out the window
Taking a trip to the Promised Land

Dead on the rail was a passenger train
Blood was a-boiling in Casey's brain
Casey said, "Hey, look out ahead
Sim, jump, Sim, jump or we'll all be dead"
With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake
North Mississippi was wide awake
IC Railroad official said
"He's a good engineer to be a-laying dead"

Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leaning out the window
Taking a trip to the Promised Land

Headaches and heartaches and all kind of pain
Are all a part of a railroad train
Sweat and toil, the good and the grand
Are part of the life of a railroad man

Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leaning out the window
Taking a trip to the Promised Land

Flesh and blood
Beside a Singin Mountain Stream
Where the Willow grew
Where the Silver Leaf of Maple
Sparkled in the Morning Dew
I braided Twigs of Willows
Made a String of Buckeye Beads
But Flesh And Blood needs Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
I leaned against a Bark of Birch
And I breathed the Honey Dew
I saw a North-bound Flock of Geese
Against a Sky of Baby Blue
Beside the Lily Pads
I carved a Whistle from a Reed
Mother Nature's quite a Lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood needs Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
A mockingbird sang just for me
And I thanked him for the Song
Then the Sun went slowly down the West
And I had to move along
These were some of the things
On which my Mind and Spirit feed
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need

And when this Day was ended
I was still not satisfied
I knew ev'rything I touched
Would wither and one day die
And Love was all that would remain
And grow from all these Seed;

And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need

Heading south from Caroline

I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Just a kid, acting smart
I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry
When that evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
'TIl my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that gal of mine
I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Crazy Horse sent out the call to Sitting Bull and Gall
And the General, he don't ride well anymore
Now, Custer split his men ― well, he won't do that again
'Cause the General, he don't ride well anymore
Twelve thousand warriors waited, they were unanticipated
And the General, he don't ride well anymore
It's not called an Indian victory but a bloody massacre
And the General, he don't ride well anymore
There might have been more enthusing if us Indians had been losing
But the General, he don't ride well anymore
General George A. Custer, oh, his yellow hair had luster
But the General, he don't ride well anymore
For now the General's silent, he got barbered violent
And the General, he can't ride well anymore
Oh, the General, he don't ride well anymore

[Song 119: A Satisfied Mind]
9 ContributorsA Satisfied Mind Lyrics
How many times have you heard someone say
"If I had his money, I could do things my way?"
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

Once I was winning in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

When life has ended and my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there's no doubt
But there's one thing for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

How many times have you heard someone say
"If I had his money, I could do things my way?"
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

[Song 120: Remember the Alamo]
8 ContributorsRemember the Alamo Lyrics
And a hundred and eighty were challenged by Travis to die
By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was nigh
Any man that would fight to the death crossed over
But him that would live, better fly
And over the line went a hundred and seventy nine

Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below!
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo

Bowie lay dying, but his powder was ready and dry
Flat on his back, Bowie killed him a few in reply
And young David Crockett was singing and laughing
With gallantry fears in his eyes
For God and for freedom, a man more than willing to die


And then they sent a young scout from the battlements, bloody and loud
With the words of farewell from a garrison valiant and proud
Grieve not, little darling, my dying, if Texas is sovereign and free
We'll never surrender and ever with liberty be

[Song 121: I Love You Because]
9 ContributorsI Love You Because Lyrics
I love you because you understand dear
Every little thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand dear
But most of all I love you because you're you

No matter what may be the style or season
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you because you're you

I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time I'm walking by your side
I love you because the future's brighter
The glow to happiness you've opened wide

No matter what the world may say about me
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you because you're you

[Song 122: Train of Love]
10 ContributorsTrain of Love Lyrics
Train of love's a-coming
Big black wheels a-humming
People waiting at the station
Happy hearts are drumming
Trainman, tell me maybe
Ain't you got my baby?

Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

Now stop your whistle blowing
'Cause I've got ways of knowing
You're bringing other people's lovers
But my own keeps going
Train of love's deceiving
When she's not gone, she's leaving

Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

Train of love, now hasten
Sweethearts standing waiting
Here and there and everywhere
They're gonna be embracing
Trainman, tell me maybe
Ain't you got my baby?

Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

Train of love's a-leaving
Leaving my heart grieving
But early or late, I sit and wait
Because I'm still believing
We'll walk away together
Though I may wait forever

Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

5 ContributorsI Saw a Man Lyrics
Last night I dreamed an angel came
He took my hand, he called my name
He bid me look the other way
I saw a man, I heard him say

He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw
The nail-scarred hands
That bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there

My life my heart I gave
My soul was in his care

When I awoke my heart beat so and in the dark I saw a glow
This was no dream he turned my way

Again I heard my Savior say

[Song 124: Trouble in Mind]
4 ContributorsTrouble in Mind LyricsTrouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun is gonna shine 'round my back door someday
I'm going down to the river
I'm gonna take me a rocking chair
And if the blues don't leave, I rock on away from here
Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living, I feel like I could die
Trouble in mind, I'm blue
My poor heart is healing slow
I've never had such trouble in my whole life before
I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
And let that 2:19 special ease my troubled mind
Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

[Song 125: Sixteen Tons]
7 ContributorsSixteen Tons Lyrics
Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bone
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said "Well, a-bless my soul"

You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning, it was drizzling rain
Fighting and trouble are my middle name
Raised in the canebrake by an old mama lion
Can't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me coming, better step aside
A lot of men didn't and a lot of men died
The one fist of iron and the other of steel
If the right one don't a-get you
Then the left one will

You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I have been ungrateful
I've been unwise
Restless from the cradle
Now I realize
It's so hard to see the rainbow
Through glasses dark as these
Maybe I'll be able
From now on, on my knees

Oh, I am weak
Oh, I know I am vain
Take this weight from me
Let my spirit be unchained

Old man swearing at the sidewalk
I'm overcome
Seems that we've both forgotten
Forgotten to go home
Oh, have I seen an angel?
Oh, have I seen a ghost?
Where's that rock of ages
When I need it most?

Oh, I am weak
Oh, I know I am vain
Take this weight from me
Let my spirit be unchained

8 ContributorsFlushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart Lyrics
From the backdoor of your life you swept me out dear
In the bread line of your dreams I lost my place
At the table of your love I got the brush off
At the Indianapolis of your heart I lost the race

I've been washed down the sink of your conscience
In the theater of your love I lost my part
And now you say you've got me out of your conscience
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart

In the garbage disposal of your dreams I've been ground up dear
On the river of your plans I'm up the creek
Up the elevator of your future I've been shafted
On the calendar of your events I'm last week

I've been washed down the sink of your conscience
In the theater of your love I lost my part
And now you say you've got me out of your conscience
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart

2 ContributorsAs Long As the Grass Shall Grow (American Recordings) Lyrics
I met you in the shadows and your face was all aglow
I remember it so well, though it was many years ago
We both knew something happened without a lot to say
But we had other lives and so we went our separate ways
But our hearts communicated and every time we passed
We were gradually building something that would forever last

As long
(As long)
As the moon
(As the moon)
Shall rise
(As the moon shall rise)
As long
(As long)
As the rivers
(As the rivers)
Flow
(As the rivers flow)
As long
(As long)
As the sun
(As the sun)
As the sun will shine
As long
As the grass
Shall grow

My heart was calling for you when one night you came along
We danced around each other but then we sang our song
Our harmony was shaky, and the pitch not very true
But then, you gave in to me and I gave in to you
We had to fight the world and we fought with all we had
We vowed to be together through the sweet times and the bad

As long
(As long)
As the moon
(As the moon)
Shall rise
(As the moon shall rise)
As long
(As long)
As the rivers
(As the rivers)
Flow
(As the rivers flow)
As long
(As long)
As the sun
(As the sun)
Will shine
As long
As the grass
Shall grow

I hear you whisper every night: "May I have this dance?"
And though I'm not light on my feet I always take the chance
We've gone through many storms and often walked through fire
But always our loving faith took us higher and higher
We know the mystery of life, it's love hard and long
(I love you)
I love you and I always will. As long...

As long
(As long)
As the moon
(As the moon)
Shall rise
(As the moon shall rise)
As long
(As long)
As the rivers
(As the rivers)
Flow

I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my Dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord - I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[Song 131: The Frozen Logger]
3 ContributorsThe Frozen Logger LyricsAs I sat down one evening within a small cafe
A forty year old waitress to me these words did say:
"I see that you are a logger, and not just a common bum
'Cause nobody but a logger stirs his coffee with is thumb
My lover was a logger, there's none like him today;
If you'd pour whiskey on it he could eat a bale of hay
He never shaved his whiskers from off of his horny hide;
He'd just drive them in with a hammer and bite them off inside
My lover came to see me upon one freezing day;
He held me in his fond embrace which broke three vertebrae
He kissed me when we parted, so hard that he broke my jaw;
I could not speak to tell him he'd forgot his mackinaw
I saw my lover leaving, sauntering through the snow
Going gaily homeward at forty-eight below
The weather it tried to freeze him, it tried its level best;
At a hundred degrees below zero, he buttoned up his vest
It froze clean through to China, it froze to the stars above;
At a thousand degrees below zero, it froze my logger love

They tried in vain to thaw him, and would you believe me, sir
They made him into axeblades, to chop the Douglas fir
And so I lost my lover, and to this cafe I come
And here I wait till someone stirs his coffee with his thumb."

You've cut out your dancing
And you never see a show
Friends come by to pick you up
And you hardly ever go
It seems your head is in the clouds above
You've got the ways of a woman in love

I walked by your house tonight
And hoped that I might see
The guy who's got you in a spin
I wish that guy was me
I don't know why it's you I'm dreaming of
You've got the ways of a woman in love

Many is the night I've stayed awake and cried
Now you'll never know how much you hurt my foolish pride

I recall your kisses
The times I held you tight
Now when I come to see you
You're sitting in the light
Missing all the things that we dreamed of
You've got the ways of a woman in love

Many is the night I've stayed awake and cried
You've got the ways of a woman in love

[Song 133: Cat’s in the Cradle]
13 ContributorsCat’s in the Cradle LyricsCash’s cover of the Harry Chapin song made famous by Cat Stevens
A child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talking before I knew it
And as he grew he'd say, I'm going to be like you dad
You know I'm going to be like you

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you coming home dad? I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, Thanks for the ball come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw? I said, Not today
I got a lot to do. He said, That's okay
He walked away but his smile never dimmed
He said, I'm going to be like him, yeah, you know I'm going to be like him

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you coming home dad? I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

Well he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while
He shook his head and then he said with a smile
What I'd really like dad is to borrow the car keys
See you later can I have them please

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you coming home dad? I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

Now, I've retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, I'd like to see you if you don't mind
He said, I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time
My new job's a hassle, and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you dad
It's been sure nice talking to you

As I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me

2 ContributorsBeans for Breakfast Lyrics
I couldn't hear you for the TV
I didn't know you said goodbye
I saw your cancelled check for the airfare
Didn't know flying got so high

Beans for breakfast once again
Hard to eat 'em from the can
I've run out of clean utensils
I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man

I heard the crows outside my window
Guess it's me they're talking about
The fire you lit has burnt to cinders
Every good thing's fizzled out

Beans for breakfast once again
Hard to eat 'em from the can
Wish you'd come back and wash the dishes
I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man

Caught a cold with the windows open
Crow droppings on my window sill
Probably got histoplasmosis
Got no gun or I would kill them crows

Beans for breakfast once again
Hard to eat 'em from the can
Plastic forks are a dime a dozen
I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man

Finally made it to the mailbox
Felt so bad I thought I'd die
All I got was a bill from my doctor
Well, I guess flying ain't so high

Beans for breakfast once again
Hard to eat 'em from the can
Blue tick mattress cold and greasy
I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man

The house burned down from the fire
That I built in your closet by mistake
After I took all them pills
But I got out safe in my duck head overalls

Beans for breakfast once again
I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
Hum

Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
Can he do to you the things that I do?
I can take you higher

It's like someone took a knife, edgy and dull
Dug a six-inch valley in the middle of my skull

At night, I wake up with the sheets soakin' wet
And a freight train runnin' through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh, I'm on fire
Oh, I'm on fire

Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?

9 ContributorsMean Eyed Cat Lyrics
I gave my woman half my money at the general store
I said, "Now buy a little groceries and don't spend no more"
But she paid ten dollars for a ten-cent hat
And bought some store-bought cat food for that mean-eyed cat

When I woke up this morning and I turned my head
There wasn't a cotton-picking thing on her side of the bed
I found a little old note where her head belonged
It said, "Dear John, honey, baby, I'm long gone"

When I heard a whistle blowing and the big wheels a-turning
I was scared as I could be
I put on my overalls and I headed for town
Gonna bring her back with me

I asked the man down at the station if he'd seen her there
I told him all about her pretty eyes and long blonde hair
He spit his tobacco and said, "I'll be dad blamed"
"I believe I did see her leaving on the eastbound train"

I bought a round-trip ticket on the eastbound train
I was broke as I could be
But when I come back, I gotta buy another ticket
Gonna bring her back with me

Well, I got off the train somewhere in Arkansas
And I worked up the guts to call my mother-in-law
She said, "I'll tell you where she is if you act right
She's working four-to-twelve at Trucker's World tonight"

Well, when I walked in, she saw me and she took off her apron
And she grabbed her going-home hat
She bought a ticket with her tips, now we're curled up on the sofa
Me and her and that mean-eyed cat

They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knees to Idols made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the Fourth Man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn
Now the prophet Daniel tells about
Three men who walked with God
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Before the wicked king they stood
And the king commanded them bound and thrown
Into the fiery furnace that day
But the fire was so hot that the men were slain
That forced them on their way
Now when the three were cast in and the king rose up
To witness this awful fate
He began to tremble at what he saw
In astonished tones he spake
Did we not cast three men bound
Into the midst of the fire
Well, Lo, I see four men unhurt
Unbound and walkin' down there;

There's Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
And the fiery coals they trod
But the form of the Fourth Man that I see
Is like the Son of God;

It happened one day at December's end
Some neighbors called on an old-time friend
And they found his shop so meager and lean
Made gay with thousand bows of green
And Conrad was sitting with face a-shine
When he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine
And he said, "My friends, at dawn today
When the cock was crowing the night away
The Lord appeared in a dream to me
And He said, "I'm coming, your guest to be."
So I've been busy with feet astir
Strewing my shop with branches of fir
The table is spread and the kettle is shined
And over the rafters the holly is twined
And now I'll wait for my Lord to appear
And listen closely so I will hear
His step as He nears my humble place
And I open the door and I'll look on His face
Then his friends went home and left Conrad alone
For this was the happiest day he had known
For long since, his family had passed away
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas Day
But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas Guest
This Christmas would be the dearest and best
So he listened with only joy in his heart
And with every sound he would rise with a start
And look for the Lord to be at his door
Like the vision that he had had a few hours before
So he ran to the window after hearing a sound
But all he could see on the snow-covered ground
Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn
But old Conrad was touched and he went to the door
And he said, "Your feet must be cold and sore
I have some shoes in my shop for you
And I have a coat to keep you warmer, too."
So with grateful heart, the man went away
But Conrad noticed the time of day
And he wondered what made the dear Lord so late
And how much longer he'd have to wait
Then he heard another knock and he ran to the door
But it was only a stranger once more
A bent old lady with a shawl of black
With a bundle of kindling piled on her back
But she asked for only a place to rest
A place that was reserved for Conrad's Great Guest
But her voice seemed to plead "Don't send me away
Let me rest for a while, it's Christmas Day"
So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup
And told her to sit at the table and sup'
But after she had left he was filled with dismay
For he saw that the hours were slipping away
And the Lord had not come as He said He would
And Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood
When out of the stillness he heard a cry
"Please help me and tell me where am I?"
So again he opened his friendly door
And stood disappointed as twice before
It was only a child who had wandered away
And was lost from her family on Christmas Day
Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad
But he knew he should make this little girl glad
So he called her in and he wiped her tears
And he quieted all her childish fears
Then he led her back to her home once more
Then as he entered his own darkened door
He knew that the Lord was not coming today
For the hours of Christmas had all passed away
So he went to his room and he knelt down to pray
And he said, "Lord, why did you delay?
What kept you from coming to call on me?
I wanted so much your face to see."
Then softly in the silence a voice he heard
"Lift up your head, I have kept my word
Three times my shadow crossed your floor
Three times I came to your lonely door
I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet
I was the woman you gave something to eat
I was the child on the homeless street
Three times I knocked, three times I came in
And each time I found the warmth of a friend
Of all the gifts, love is the best
I was honored to be your Christmas Guest

[Song 144: Highwayman]
13 ContributorsHighwayman LyricsI was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive
I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still
I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around, I'll always be around
And around and around and around and around
I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again
And again and again and again and again

[Song 145: Banks of the Ohio]
7 ContributorsBanks of the Ohio Lyrics
I asked my love to take a walk
Take a walk, just a little ways
And as we walked along we talked
Of when would be our wedding day

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others' arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others' arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried, "Oh, Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity"
I took her by her golden curls
And drug her down to the riverside
And there I threw her in to drown
And I watched her as she floated down

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others' arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

And going home between twelve and one
I cried, "Oh, Lord, what have I done?"
I've killed the only girl I love
Because she would not marry me

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others' arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

[Song 146: Wabash Cannonball]
10 ContributorsWabash Cannonball Lyrics
From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
She climbs a flowery mountains other the hills and by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all
She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
She's from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the courts throughout the land
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

[Song 147: Swing Low, Sweet Chariot]
9 ContributorsSwing Low, Sweet Chariot Lyrics
Well, I looked over Jordan, and what did I see?
Coming for to carry me home
There was a band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

I'm sometimes up, and I'm sometimes down
Coming for to carry me home
But but I know my soul is heavenly bound
Coming for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

If you get there before I do
Coming for to carry me home
Tell all my friends that I'm a-coming too
Coming for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

And now they're coming for to carry me home

[Song 148: The Baron]
7 ContributorsThe Baron Lyrics
Wish I had of known ya
When you were a little younger
'Round me you might have learned a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little stronger
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do

As he walked into the poolroom
You could tell he didn't fit
In his hand-made boots, custom suit, pearl handled shooting stick
Tonight there'd be a showdown
Then everyone would know
Who shoots the meanest game around
The Baron or Billy Joe
Billy Joe looked edgy, about to lose his cool
But the Baron's hands were steady
As the two began to duel
Yeah, he was like a general
On a battlefield of slate
And he would say to Billy Joe
Each time he sunk the eight, he'd say

Wish I had of known ya
When you were a little younger
'Round me you might have learned a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little stronger
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do

Now Billy Joe was busted
But he hadn't felt the sting
And from the far end of the table
He threw his Mother's wedding ring
And he said, "You won my money
But it ain't gonna do the trick
I'll bet this ring on one more game
Against your fancy stick"
The Baron's eyes got foggy
As the ring rolled on the felt
And he almost doubled over
Like he was hit below the belt
Twenty years ago
It was the ring his wife had worn
And he didn't know before he left
That a son would soon be born
It sounded just like thunder
When the Baron shot the break
But it grew quickly quiet
As he lined up the eight
Then a warm hand touched his shoulder
And it chilled him to the bone
When he turned and saw the woman
Who had loved him for so long
The game was never finished
The eight ball never fell
The Baron calmly picked it up
And put it on the shelf
Then he placed the ring in the hands that held him long ago
And he tossed that fancy shooting stick to his son Billy Joe
And he said

Well, wish I had of known ya
When you were a little younger
'Round me you might have learned a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little stronger
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do

[Song 149: I Got Stripes (On a Monday)]
2 ContributorsI Got Stripes (On a Monday) LyricsOn a Monday, I was arrested (uh huh)
On a Tuesday, they locked me in the jail (oh boy)
On a Wednesday, my trial was attested
On a Thursday, they said guilty and the Judge's gavel fell
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains
They're about to drag me down
On a Monday, my momma come to see me
On a Tuesday, they caught me with a file
On a Wednesday, I'm down in solitary
On a Thursday, I start on bread and water for a while
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains
They're about to drag me down
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains
They're about to drag me down

Hey, this microphone's got a screw loose here
Somebody come screw this microphone?
What I say?
Just a minute, lemme fix this son of alright

[Song 150: Can’t Help but Wonder Where I’m Bound]
7 ContributorsCan’t Help but Wonder Where I’m Bound Lyrics
It's a long and dusty road, a hot and a heavy load
And the folks I meet aren't always kind
Some are bad and some are good
Some have done the best they could
And some have tried to ease my troubled mind

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

I've been wandering through this land just doing the best I can
Trying to find what I was meant to do
And the people that I see look as worried as can be
And it looks like they are wondering too

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

We, I had a little girl one time, she had lips like sherry wine
And she loved me until my head went plumb insane
But I was too blind to see she was drifting away from me
And my good gal went off on the morning train

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

If you see me passing by and you sit and you wonder why
And you wish that you were rambling too
Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor, lace them up and bar the door
Thank your stars for the roof that's over you

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound
