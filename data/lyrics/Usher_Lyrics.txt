From the game she was spittin' in my ear, you would think that she know me (Know me)
I decided to chill (Okay)
Conversation got heavy (Hey)
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
Watch out! (Oh)

She was sayin', "Come get me" (Come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, "Baby, let's go" (Let's go)
When I told her, I said

Yeah, yeah
Shawty got down low, she said, "Come and get me"

Got me thinkin' that it might be a good idea to take her with me (With me)
'Cause she's ready to leave (Ready to leave now; oh, let's go)
Now I gotta keep it real now (Yeah)
'Cause on a one-to-ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (Hey)
'Cause I don't know if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me (Hey, hey, hey)
The way she get low

She asked for one more dance
And I'm like, "Yeah, how the hell am I supposed to leave?" And I said (Let's go, bring the beat back)

If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (Yeah)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (What)
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in they birthday suit (Yeah)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag' and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin', then I put 'em on foot patrol (Let's go, ow)
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand?
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah)
Ludacris fill cups like double Ds (Yeah)
Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed, that say

Yeah, yeah
Shawty got down low, she said, "Come and get me"
Yeah, yeah
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me

Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn

It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time comin', but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn (Yeah), let it burn (Ooh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through (Yeah)
Let it burn (Let it burn, woah), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now, it's too late
I know she ain't comin' back
What I gotta do now (Now) to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to (Oh)
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't (Cause the party ain't)
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn, oh), gotta let it burn (Oh)
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through (Know it's through)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn (Ooh, girl, I)

I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burnin'?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

You will always be my boo (Come on)

Do you remember, girl?
I was the one who gave you your first kiss
'Cause I remember, girl
I was the one who said, "Put your lips like this"
Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
Girl, I was there when you were my baby

It started when we were younger, you were mine (My boo)
Now, another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (My boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (It's alright, girl, that's okay)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (My boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (My boo, that's my baby)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (I can't hide it, my boo)
And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo

Yes, I remember, boy
'Cause after we kissed, I could only think about your lips
Yes, I remember, boy
The moment I knew you were the one I could spend my life with
Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
I was there
And you were my baby

It started when we were younger, you were mine (You were mine; My boo)
Now, another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (Yes, in here; My boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (It's alright now, it's okay; My boo)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (You were mine, my boo; My boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (It's still in your eyes; My boo)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (It's alright now, it's okay; My boo)

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all, at all

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax

Yeah
Ursher, baby
This is for the A

Shawty, I don't mind
If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you comin' home
Girl, I don't mind

The ballers in here tonight, they gon' buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon' make it colossal in here
'Cause shawty, you thinkin' them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas, they crowdin' around you like they seen Beyoncé in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

Shawty, I don't mind
If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you comin' home
Girl, I don’t mind

When you get off of work I'll be ready to go in the 'Rari
And when we get home we'll have us our own private party in here
So I don’t worry at all about the things they do or say
I love you anyway
You can twerk while in a split, you rackin' up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin', I'm proud to call you my bitch
They'd be lookin', but they can't touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doin' what you're doin'

Shawty, I don't mind
If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you comin' home
Girl, I don't mind

(It's ya boy, Juicy J)
I’m just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

Shawty, I don't mind
If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me
You gotta make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you comin' home
Girl, I don't mind

Watch this

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh, oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Yeah, yeah)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do (No)
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions (This is part two, oh, oh)
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (Tell it all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (I don't know, I don't know)
But to give you part two of my confessions

Sitting here, stuck on stupid, tryin' to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racin' to her place
Talking to myself, preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't wanna come near me
I said, "One second, baby, please hear me"

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Chick on the side, oh, I)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed (So gone, so gone) and I don't know what to do
(What to do) I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (Cried, when I got it)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (Didn't know what to do)
But to give you part two of my confessions (But I need to tell you, baby)

This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do

Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ooh

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

(You) You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone (Oh, yeah), hang up and you call right back
(Oh, you) You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (You can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her, "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies, say, "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"

See, I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

You got it, you got it bad (Hey, hey, no, no)
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back

Oooooh, ooooh
Ooooh, ooh ooooh
Ooh ooooh
Oooooh, ooooh, ooooh

Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long
Girl, I been doing you so wrong
And I want you to know that
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long
Girl, I been doing you so wrong
And I want you to know that...

Every time I was in L.A., I was with my ex-girlfriend
Every time you called, I told you, "Baby, I'm working"
(No!) I was out doing my dirt
(Oh!) Wasn't thinking 'bout you getting hurt
(I) was hand-in-hand in the Beverly Center like, man
Not giving a damn who sees me
So gone, so wrong
Acting like I didn't have you sitting at home
Thinking about me
Being the good girl that you are
I bet you probably believe you got a good man
A man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself, it ain't good
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else

Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride (Wooooooaaaah)
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long (Yeah)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Yeah yeah)
And I want you to know that
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride (Ooh ooh yeah)
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad (All bad)
And I just wanna confess (Yeah yeah)
It's been going on so long (So long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (So wrong)
And I want you to know that...

If I could turn back the hands of time and start all over, I would
Instead of everything being all bad, baby, everything'll be all good
I don't wanna lose you
But I know what I'm telling you ain't gon' make you wanna stay
You probably just wanna run away
I'm mad enough to punch me in my face
I've been living like an idiot and I deserve every bit of it
I know today is the day that I end all the lying and the playing and the bullshit, girl
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry
But I can no longer walk around with this stress on my chest
I confesssssss...

Everything that I've been doing is all bad (Everything)
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride (Wooooooaaaah)
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long (So long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Too wrong)
And I want you to know that (Want you to know)
Everything that I've been doing is all bad (All bad)
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess (Ooh ooh ooh)
It's been going on so long (So long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong
And I want you to know that...

Stevie, break it down
Oh oh, oh oh
Dear baby
Oh, baby
Don't leave me, baby


(Everything that I've)
Everything that (been doing) I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just (it's all bad) wanna confess
It's been going on so long (Going on so long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Doing you so wrong)
And I want you to know that
Everything (all bad, all bad) that I've been doing is all bad (All bad)

Ain't none good, it's all bad (Oh baby)
And I just wanna confess (Oh baby)
It's been going on so long
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Oh, no baby)
And I want you to know that (So bad, so bad)

Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got somethin' to tell you
Listen

See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See, this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent, she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

But you remind me of a girl that I once knew (Oh, oh)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Whenever I look, I look)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (Won't believe, won't believe, won't believe it, baby, uh, oh no, no)
This is why I just can't get with you

Thought that she was the one for me
'Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexin' everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

You remind me of a girl that I once knew (No, no no no, no, ah yeah)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Have a bad look, I look at you)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (She put me through, yeah)
This is why I just can't get with you (Uh)

(I know, yeah)
I know it's so unfair to you (Ha! It's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you (Whoa, oh I)
Wish I knew (Wish I knew how to separate the two)
You remind me (You remind me)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ah, oh...

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Gotta let you go)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (Said I had, huh)
This is why I just can't get with you (Gotta let you go)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (You remind me, of a girl, hey)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Hey! Oh! Oh! You wouldn't believe it)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (All the shit she put me through)
This is why I just can't get with you (No no)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (You remind me of a girl that, that I once knew, oh no no)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Oh no, no, no, no)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you (You wouldn't believe )
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (Uh, baby I'm sorry, I gotta let you go, oh whoa, no)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Baby I'm sorry, I gotta let you go, no, no, no)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (Oh no, oh no)
This is why I just can't get with you (You remind me)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (Of a girl that I once knew, yeah, yeah, yeah)
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (All the things she put me, me through, yeah)
This is why I just can't get with you

See her face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

She got me throwing Spades Ace with that mouth
I guess only time gon' tell
You gotta give me dirty love
I guess I'm down too
When I can't find any words I lie
Look up and see the stars in a perfect line
The feeling of love is a global thing

So tell me how you feel (how you feel)
Knowing I see the world when I look in your eyes
Your kisses are Duracell, they keep me energized
Tired of going back and forth, baby I'm hypnotized
You gotta a nigga on the love on the low though
I'm looking at you and I swear it's been a long road
A great ass, a better mind, what a combo
You know you pretty and you winning with the convo
She kinda tipsy, we been drinking, she's a light weight
She love the way I'm pull them panties in the right way
But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling
I just love the times when I'm beside ya
Holding me down cause you're my rider
I look in your eyes and I get higher
There's nothing in this world I hold tighter
Without you I feel uneven

Make every day our love season
Baby girl you know you're my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
(You gotta give me that)
I put that on the Bible
(You gotta give me that girl)
You're the only thing that I want
Give me that feeling
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
I call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible
I'ma love ya till my time's gone
You gotta give me dirty love

I've been here and trust me, I've seen it all before though
I told my ex for me relationships a no-no
And here I am thinking we perfect like a photo
You looking at me like right now you need some mo', mo'
I know you ready and willing but that ain't my place
I know you wanna settle down, all on your face
Feeling starting to get too familiar
So cover up this broken love treason

Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
I call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible
You're the only thing that I want

Call you bae that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivalsI put that on the Bible
I'ma love ya till my time's gone

You say I see ya side by side
Like a visionary, I can't see me falling
(Nothing's changed)
Like a dictionary, I can't read through all this
(Eyes wide open)
I still fall blind I don't know how this will end
Let's go back to the beginning
Let's cover up this broken love treason

Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible

Suggest little nice things I should do

Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Oh yeah)
You make me, you make me

Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowin' it should've been you
And what's sad is that I love her, but I'm fallin' for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Say what you do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Ah, yeah)
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Yeah-hey)
You make me, you make me

At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go (Gotta let her go)
And if she may not understand it while all of this is goin' on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me (You make me wanna)

(Hey) You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Oh)
(Oh, you make, make, make me)
You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Ooh, oh, babe)
You make me wanna (Go on, babe, do your thing)
You make me wanna (Ooh, ooh-ooh yeah)
(Come along wit' it, you're makin' me, you're makin' me)

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Say what you do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Ah, yeah)
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Yeah-hey)
You make me, you make me (You're makin' me)
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ooh, you're makin' me, you're makin' me, you're makin' me)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Oh)
You make me, you make me (You make me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Wanna leave the one I'm with)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (You make me, you make me do)

Yo, Keith, you was right

You say you're searchin' for somebody that'll take you out and do you right
Well, come here, baby and let Daddy show you what it feel like
You know all you gotta do is tell me what you're sippin' on
And I promise that I'm gonna keep it comin' all night long

Lookin' in your eyes while you on the other side
And I think that, shawty, I got a thing for you
Doin' it on purpose, windin' and workin' it
I can tell by the way you're lookin' at me, girl

I wanna make love in this club (Hey)

You can leave them with my homies, let them know that I got you
If you didn't know, you're the only thing that's on my mind
'Cause the way I'm starin' at you got me wanna give it to you all night

Looking in your eyes while you on the other side
I can't take it no more, baby, I'm comin' for you

It's goin' down on aisle three, I'll bag you like some groceries
And every time you think about it, you gon' want some more of me
'Bout to hit the club, make a movie, yeah, rated R
Pulled up like a trap star, that's if you had your regular car
You ever made love to a thug in the club with his ice on?
87 Jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes on
On the couch, on the table, on the bar, or on the floor
You can meet me in the bathroom
Yeah, you know I'm trained to go

Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touchin' like this
I know you're scared, baby, they don't know what we doin'
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl, and I swear
I'ma give it to you non-stop
And I don't care who's watchin'
Watchin', watchin'
In this club, on the floor
Baby, let's make love

I wanna make love in this club (Hey)

Yeah, yeah
Oh, remix

Now, baby girl, there ain't nothin' more that I can say
You know by now, I want it more than anything
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody
I know you want it (Yeah)
But I'm hesitatin' (Why?)
You must be crazy, I got a man, you got a lady
I know, we here together, so this must be somethin' special
'Cause you could be anywhere you wanted

But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
Don't be shy, come let your boy get in
So you can tell all of your friends
You was on the remix, like...

In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin', I ain't stoppin'
Baby, I don't give up
In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin'
Baby, I don't give up in this club

Baby, you know I'd be down
But we can't have all these people starin', standin' around
This right here is only for your eyes to see
But you gettin' carried away, sayin' we can do it wherever
The way you touchin' me like no other
I'ma make you feel insane
Tryin' your hardest to make me give in
But I'ma be down to give you whatchu wantin' if you keep it up
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up
And I don't want security rollin' up on us (I got you)
I'm not hesitatin', I just don't wanna rush
You could be anywhere you wanted

But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
I guess if I mess around and let you get in
You gon' tell all of your friends
You was on this remix, like...

In this club, in this club
Fellas, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up

Baby, I don't give up in this club

Ahem, shawty want a thug
It started with a hug
And the rest went like this
I gave her neck, a kissy-kiss
She gave my neck a kiss back
I said, we could do it like a stack
I mean, we could do it like a G
On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty, we could get it on
I'm like, "Shout out to the DJ for playin' this song"
Girl, we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doin' a dance move
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl
Haha, and it started with a hug
But now we makin' love in this club
And we not gonna stop just because
The people in the crowd are watchin' us
But we don't give a damn what they say
And this is the, the remix, baby

Come a little closer to Daddy, put it on you
Need you to know what happens here, stays here
And I'm ready and willin', almost got to go
Got you standin' at attention, keep it on the low
Ain't nobody watchin', don't worry, they can't see us
I know I got you hot, now let me in
You in the club or the car, wherever you are
Run and tell the DJ, run it back on replay

In this club, in this club
Fellas (Ladies), can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin', I ain't stoppin'
Baby, I don't give up
Now, run and tell all of your friends
You gotta hear this remix, like...

Should I take you home?
I don't mean to keep you waiting
But I just gotta know if you're ready

She say she wanna take her skirt off, be my guest
I decided to take my shirt off and show my chest
And we've been sipping on that Merlot
So you know what's next
Working intermissions, switching positions
We so explicit, oh...

You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl, I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game, mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Quit talking 'bout it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

I'll be anticipating
What you would do to me
What you gon' do to me?
Sex education
Hands on when you're with me
Can you handle me?

She say she wanna take her skirt off, be my guest

Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Quit talking 'bout it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

Got on all my ice, talking cash shit
Been balling all my life, Lamborghini's, fast whips
She down to ride and deserves a boss who down to provide
We run the streets, but on G5's, I'm talking fly
Boots and blue jeans, Cartier, newer rings
You with a big boy, so we do the big things
Had to valet park it, Chanel hoodie on
Looking like Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I'm wanted
She on my wanted poster, Ciroc in my mimosa
I'm balling like LeBron, we shopping in Milan
The 458 Ferrari, I park it on the lawn
I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb
The sex is so explosive, her stuff is supersonic
She my new addiction, I swear, I'm through with chronic
Rozay and Usher Raymond, girl, we the hottest
Rocking the most ice, I said we the hottest

You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
I can't wait to get you home

Usher, baby
Yeah, yeah
Did it again
And this time, I'ma make you scream (Usher)
Yeah, man

I see you over there, so hypnotic
Thinking 'bout what I'd do to that body
I'd get you like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Got no drink in my hand, but I'm wasted
Getting drunk off the thought of you naked
I get you like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby

And I ain't tryin' to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

If you wanna scream, “yeah”
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream (Yeah, c'mon)

Kill the lights, shut them off, you're electric
Devil eyes telling me come and get it
I'll have you like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Girl, tonight, you're the prey, I'm the hunter (Hunter)
Take you here, take you there, take you under
Imagine me, whispering in your ear that I wanna
Take off all your clothes and put something on you

And I try to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

If you wanna scream, “yeah”, oh
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby, yeah
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream

I'ma make you scream loud
La da, scream, la da (Usher)
La da, la da, la da, da da da
Hey, somebody scream out with me, oh

If you wanna scream, “yeah”
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you want it done right (Right)
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream (Scream, scream, scream)

We ain't good good, but we still good
We ain't good good, but we still good

I hate that we didn't make it to forever
Probably ain't gettin' back together
But that don't mean that I can't wish you better
We ain't good good, but we still good
I realize that I can't be your lover
Let's just keep it honest with each other
I'll be happy for you when you find another
We ain't good good, but we still good

Who knew it'd be like this?
Usually my exes turn to enemies
But this is different
'Cause we done got closer now that you ain't with me (Oh)
All that love that we had
Ain't no way we gon' forget that
And your family love me like I'm family
You know where you stand with me
So when they ask, tell 'em

Right one, right place, wrong time
Can't say we didn't try
But you always been a real one
Even though we ain't together
It was real love, and baby, it's still love

I hate that we didn't make it to forever
Probably ain't gettin' back together
But that don't mean that I can't wish you better (Oh-oh)
We ain't good good, but we still good

All them plans you made for me to be your missus
All the stacks that you done spent on me at Lenox
It don't go forgotten, but we're happier apart than locked in (Locked in)
No smoke with me, I promise, boy, I don't do drama
It didn't work, but I hope you find another
I wish you peace, I wish you good sex, and good sleep
Find the girl of your dreams
'Cause I sleep well at night knowin' this ain't meant to be (Oh)

Right one, right place, wrong time
Can't say we didn't try
All good things come to an end
So let's just learn the lessons and find lovin' again

I hate that we didn't make it to forever
Probably ain't gettin' back together
But that don't mean that I can't wish you better
We ain't good good, but we still good
I realize that I can't be your lover (Lover)
Let's just keep it honest with each other (Other)
I'll be happy for you when you find another
We ain't good good, but we still good

No matter who you with, I wanna see you happy (On God)
Yeah, it didn't work out but that don't mean you should attack me (21, 21)
We enjoy the five-star meals, but you was with me for the Zaxby’s (Facts)
Holdin' me down from the start (21), I used to be broke, I was ashy (21)
I hate we didn't tie the knot, but shit, that's how life go (Oh God)
You always would say that I might blow (21)
Got rich and I paid for your lipo' (21)
I know the person you is (Yeah)
That's why I still wanna be friends (On God)
If you wanna open up a new salon, I still help pay for the wigs (Straight up)
And I help with the lease (On God)
You know I ain't never been cheap (21)
Relationships don't always last, but let's not turn it to beef (21)
I come through from time to time and have you grabbin' them sheets (21)
That's if you want to, I'm just playin', girl, stop smackin' your teeth (21, 21)

I hate that we didn't make it to forever
Probably ain't gettin' back together (You know)
But that don't mean that I can't wish you better (Don't mean I can't wish you better)
We ain't good good, but we still good (We still good)
I realize that I can't be your lover (No)
Let's just keep it honest with each other
I'll be happy for you when you find another (Another)
We ain't good good, but we still good

'Cause I'm about to have a menage with his lady
And some freaks at the bar who like fucking with a star
I told her

If you're coming with me, really coming with me
You go get some girls and bring them to me
If you're coming with me, really coming with me
You let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak
Be my little freak, be my little freak

And now you in the corner, kissing on a girl
I'm about to have a menage with these here ladies
Look at those freaks at the bar, yeah, they looking for a star

Excuse me, little mama, but you could say I'm on duty
I'm looking for a cutie, a real big old ghetto booty (Big ol')
I really like your kitty cat, and if you let me touch her
I know you're not a bluffer, I'll take you to go see Usher (Yeah, man)
I keep a couple hoes, like Santa, I keep a vixen
Got that Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen
I'm hotter than a hundred degrees
A lot of bread, no sesame seeds
If I'm in your city, I'm signing them tig-ole-bitties

The girls want a Minaj, yeah, they wetter than a rainman
Usher, buzz me in, everybody loves Raymond

You go get some girls and bring them to me

It's like whatever I do (Ooh)
Just can't get through to you (Ooh, ooh)
I'm never gonna tell nothing wrong (Ooh, ooh)
Listen (ooh)

Now, now she loved me, shawty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately, I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave, but you lied to me when you said that
"Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back"

I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains... (Moving mountains)
It's like moving mountains... (Moving mountains)
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Ooh, ooh
Be, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her
We rarely even ever say a word
I really want to give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man I'm tired
Every kiss that I miss
Girl, you know I'm trying
You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say
"I love you", and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
'Cause we will never be the same, ooh
I've been standing in gas and you have been the flame

I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to get through
Gotta move this mountain
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains... (Moving mountains)
It's like moving mountains... (Moving mountains)
Baby, why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?

This must be a slow death that I'm traveling on
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holding on
See, no matter what it takes
I've gotta get it together, baby, yeah
And these hills that I'm traveling up
She ain't showing me love
I'm down on my love
Oh, I'm down, whoa

I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains (Moving this mountain, ayy)
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving a mountain
Steady trying to move this mountain
So, baby, why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be? Ooh, ooh

Baby, baby
Whoa, yeah

Which means I downgraded to a human being
You was born a Goddess, I made you my queen
Which mean we upgraded to Louis the thirteen
Hot tottie, her poppy like Cognac
Her momma like herb tea, we birthed a couple of sacks
And as the tea steeped, I creeped all in her tee-pee
We did it Indian style, had the girls speaking
In tongues, she like young, you hung, what you done done
Stop it, before you wake up my mom, I might (Ah)
And now that you arrived, it’s time that I go
I'm so cold, I'm so cold

28 ContributorsTell Me Lyrics
I just wanna
I just wanna take my time, my time, my time with you
Oooh, oooh

We're here alone while the thunder is roaring
And the windows are blowing
'Cause it's storming and pouring tonight
I put my hand on your chest
I can feel your heart
And it's beating kinda fast, so is mine
In this moment of silence, you look me in the eyes
Nothing is verbalized, but so much is said
I need you so much
The more I'm away from you, the more of you I want
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
(I need you)

I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna really make love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah
Baby, I'm a man that believes in what it is

We're going to a whole 'nother level
When we do it, it's so true
And it's so much more than sexual tonight
When we're connected, every touch, every kiss is perfected
It's like when we finally found what we been looking for
It gets better and better with time
This is deeper than love
The more of you I have, the more of you I want
Oooh, oooh
(Oh, I need you, baby)
Oooh, oooh
(Woah)

I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna really make love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah
Baby, I'm a man that believes in what it is

Oooh, oooh
Hey, hey
Oh baby, can we go deeper?
Deeper than the surface
Further than that

I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna really make love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah

Woman and man, fight so hard
But when the two become one, we work out problems
And we fix I, whenever we get body to body
Body to body, body to body
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)
(I want you)
When you so wet and I'm so hard
And when the two become one, it's like, oh my God
And then we feeling like our spirits want to leave our body
Leave our body, leave our body
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)
(I want you)

Until your soul lets me in
I want to

Woman and man, fight so hard
But when the two become one, we work out problems
And we fix it, whenever we get body to body
Body to body, body to body
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)

When you so wet and I'm so hard
And when the two become one, it's like, oh my God
And then we feeling like our spirits want to leave our body

What's up, baby?
I'm so glad I got you here
I'm so in love with you
And I don't ever wanna lose you
I wanna take this to the next level
I hope you ready

Now that you're here
I got something to say, baby
I think that you should know
You're doing the most, sugar (Sugar)
So don't worry 'bout the situation (Situation)
I'd never let you go

Can you handle it, can I go there, baby, with you?
We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle?

Wooooo, baby
You say all the time you only want the best of my love
Now I can see that there's only one way to tear it up, yeah
I'm willing to tell you everything I let stand between us
But what if I tell you too much?

What about you, babe?
Will you tell me all the freaky things you are?
Before I do, need you to know
If we make it through, our love will grow
Ahh ah-oh, imagine how amazing things would be

Can you handle it, can I go there, baby, with you?
We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle?
I can handle it, I can go there, baby, with you

We gon' set it out, we gon' work it out
Baby, can you handle?

Wooooo, ah yeah baby
I fear sometimes in my mind
That you won't wanna stay with my love
Oh baby, if I can be sure
Inside out that you know exactly the man that comes to see you
I'll go deep as I can
Giving you the rest of my love
But what if I tell you too much?

So much to explore
So much we have yet to discover
I ask myself, "Should I go there?
Should I do it?" (Yeah, oh, oh oh)
Can I give it to you fully?
Can you handle it?

Can you handle it, if I go there, baby, with you? (Can I go there?)

Baby, can you handle?
I can handle it, I can go there, baby, with you
We gon' set it out, we gon' work it out

Wait for it, wait for it

Wait for it, wait for it

Theodosia writes me a letter every day
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
Well he can keep all of Georgia
'Cause Theodosia, she's mine

Love don't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep lovin' anyway
We laugh and we cry and we break
And we make our mistakes
If there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
I'm willing to wait for it
Then, I'm willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it

My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher, preacher, preacher, preacher
But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya, teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
My mother was a genius, genius, my father commanded respect, respect
When they died they left no instructions, just a legacy to protect

Death don’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
Yeah, we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
If there’s a reason I’m still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it
Then I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it...

(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am the one thing in life I can control
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am inimitable, I am original
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am not falling behind or running late
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am not standing still, I am lying in wait
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
Everyone faces an endless uphill climb
You got something to prove, you got nothing to lose
Everyone’s pace is relentless, you waste no time, time
What is it like in his shoes?

Life don't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
Taking me, taking me, taking...
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
But I know there's a reason I'm alive
So many have died
And I'm still waiting for it
I'm willing to wait for it

Life don’t discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
If there’s a reason I’m still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it (Yes I am)
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it

I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it

No, for real, don't play like that
Are you, are you serious?

Every time I was in L.A., I was with my ex-girlfriend
Every time you called, I told you, "Baby, I'm working"
(No!) I was out doin' my dirt
(Oh!) Wasn't thinkin' about you gettin' hurt
(I) was hand-in-hand in the Beverly Center, like, man
Not givin' a damn who sees me
So gone (I know)
So wrong (Just listen)
Acting like I didn't have you sittin' at home
Thinkin' about me
Bein' a good girl that you are
I bet you probably believe you got a good man
A man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself, it ain't good
But it would be the worse if you heard this from somebody else
(Oh no)

I know you hate me
I know I hurt you
But there's more

Oh, oh, oh, papers
Oh, oh, oh, papers

I can't get to work on time
Can't believe the words to her I just said
But who the hell argue and fight like dogs at 6 in the morning?
I know it's gonna be some more shh... tonight, oohh
Our pastor's calling, telling me I done went too far
And I'm seen around town and my friends can't recognize me
'Cause I took a chance on love
It's like I'm dying (oooh dying)

For you, I gave my heart and turned my back against the world
'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl
I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man that I never thought I'd be
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
I can't deny how much I love you, I done gave up everything I had to
As hard as it is, I'm afraid I gotta say
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
Oh, oh, oh, papers
Oh, oh, oh, papers

I'm losing my mind, can't figure out who's wrong or right
I know it's you I love, but then, I also know it's you I don't like
You claim you hate who I was, but that's the reason you here now
You think I don't know what's up, but sweetheart, that's what ruined us
I ain't afraid to say I got needs, but the only time you here for me
Is when the bottles popping and everything is sweet
But I, I'm tired of sleeping in the other room spending them long nights
Trying to figure out what in the hell in my heart I ain't do right

For you, I gave my heart and turned my back against the world
'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl
I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man that I never thought I'd be
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
I can't deny how much I love you, I done gave up everything I had to
As hard as it is, I'm afraid I gotta say
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
Oh, oh, papers
Oh, oh, oh, papers

(Ready, ready, ready, ready)
All my fellas up in here
If you had enough and you're ready to sign, say
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)
I'm ready, yes I am
All my ladies, if you sick and tired
And you're ready to sign, say
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)
Oh, I can't keep living this life, I said, I'm leaving for the last time I'm
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)

I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man that I never thought I'd be
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
I can't deny how much I love you, I done gave up everything I had to
As hard as it is, I'm afraid I gotta say
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl

19 ContributorsMore Lyrics
Watch me as I dance under the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out more, more
'Cause I create the feeling that keep them coming back
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep them coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up

If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite
Put em in the air, if you more, and more
'Cause I can't wait to feel it
I go hard, can't stop
But if I stop, just know that I'ma bring it back
Never quitting, don't believe in that

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up

If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Oh, oh
Oh, gonna push it to the limit, give it more
Oh, oh
Oh, gonna push it to the limit, give it more

If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Oh, oh
Oh, gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Out there doing what I'm doing
Or tryna do what I'm doing
But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh? Come on

I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, "Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly?"
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want (You can get mad if you want to)
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it—

My way (My way)
My way (Oh, oh)
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way
My way (Oh, oh)
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

Bad ass, señoritas, two-seaters with kicks
New kicks, all in the mix (That's right)
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catching bricks don't concern me (Haha, yo)
So forget it, little midget
My mind on seven digits
Before I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it (Yo, yo, yo, yo)
I'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots (What?)
Saying "You can't front" (And you can't front)
So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat
And what I do? Be the Major League
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door (Yeah)
Shotgun in my drop, having fun with the Don
System bassing, conversation (See what I mean?)
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, "Give it to me now, baby"

My way (Ooh)
My way (Do it, do it)
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way (My way)
My way (Oh woah)
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

Don't check me (Check me)
It was your girl who let me (Let me)
Take it this far, then, ooh wee (Ooh wee)
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
And I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gonna give it up
She likes it—

My way (Ooh)
My way (My way, my way, my way)
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it (She keeps running back to me)
My way (Oh woah, yeah)
My way
What I say, goes (Goes)
And I'm in control (I'm in control, I'm in control)
My way (Oh, my way)
My way (Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy)

How the fuck you choke then don't choke
Then do it both from the side? Hey
Now you're layin' there breathless
A sign of instant rush

All this lickin' your lips, goin' back and forth
Gaped open, back arched, and rude

I just love that glue
That slides down you whenever we start touchin'
It gets all on you, all on me from fucking
That's when that glue done got you
Hey

Say you never had a challenge

So tell me does, does that mean that you faked all your orgasms, baby?
Ooh, I'm gon' make sure, absolutely sure tonight

Grab my neck, put it on my face
Them open lips told me to get inside
Then you told me to come around the other way, ooh
I guess that's how you act when you really want somebody (Ooh)

They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Leave it till it's gone
I'm just sayin' that what don't kill
Only makes you strong
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

Let's go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb
I can feel you now

Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well, is that really insanity
Or just a loser's game? Ha
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

Some things never change, here we go again, yeah
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

Just go numb
You never know until you let go
We all go numb
I can feel you now (Numb)

I can feel you now
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
But you can't feel it, do you?

Shake it off, then you go, I don't care anymore (Numb)

Sexy, women, women
Sensuous, sexy, voluptuous, hah
It don't matter, baby
If you got it, you got it
Seduce me baby, seduce me

Just to get my attention, send a note and a drink
When we made eye connection, she nodded and winked
On this note it said, "It's 'bout time we get together
Let's dance now, hook up later, we can do whatever"
She had confidence, it's all part of the game
'Cause to her, who I'm with don't really mean a thing
She knew what I liked and now I'm thirsty for more, baby

Seduction
Sensuous, sexy, erotic
How you working your body
You gon' make me do it, do it to you
Seduction
You thought out your best to get me out of control, baby
More I play around with you
Make me wanna get down with you (down)
Down with you (down), down with you (down, down)

Baby, you got my attention, what you gon' do with it? (Ha ha)
Baby, turn around, stick it out, I wanna see it
She'll make the first move, smooth, intoxicating
She crazy (I like it, I'ma be honest)
I'm fighting not to lose control
I'm feeling a little tension, don't know whose watching
Getting big (in too deep, and I can't stop it)
You're making it (HARD) for me to stay
(HARD) to walk away
(HARD) don't wanna play no more
(HARD) ohh, I can't take it, baby

How you working your body

Make me wanna get down with you (down)
Down with you (down), down with you (down, down)

Baby, whatever you want, girl, you got it
Long as you're satisfied
'Cause it's so hard to resist
Ooh, your body got me on fire
Got vivid thoughts in my mind
The positions that I'm gonna try
But is it worth all the hurt?
Should I risk it just for one night?
Once I give in
She's gonna win
Either way I lose

I'm trying to chill, but she got me on the spot
She's so cocky and the way that she watching me
Got me feeling hot, uh
Shorty know that I got a girl and I really can't break the rules
Plus paparazzi snapping shots
And it's hard for me to shake these fools
So do I one: put it on her, work my way to the front?
Do I two: play my part and chill, don't try to pull no stunts?
Or maybe three: (yeah) chase the cat 'cause she's sending me on the hunt
Nah, bump that, I ain't no punk
I'ma give the shorty what she want
Watch this

Seduction (ready to go)
Sensuous, (taking you up on what you said earlier) sexy, erotic
How you working your body (when we danced)
You gon' make me do it, do it to you
Seduction
You thought out your best to get me out of control, baby
More I play around with you
Make me wanna get down with you (down)
Down with you (down), down with you (down, down)

Everything you do is everything I know
No need to pretend, we both know what you want
Say you gotta good thing, he don't have to know
Everything you and I do, only I know it
We could make this easy
I know you don't need me, this ain't that kind of thing
It's more of a fling
That's why when you leave

I don’t want no one coming through
Don't act like this body yours
What I do in my downtime
Is what I do in my downtime
We connect, we wanna feel
That shit don't have no meaning
But what you do in your downtime
Is what you do in your downtime
That's everything I know
Girl that's everything I know
Yeah, yeah, that's everything I know
That's the only thing I know

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Left the country just to spend the weekend here to fuck me
What is not the only thing that's coming
All your friends are calling you
Like "OMG your such and such is lucky"
It's touching my soul
But little does anyone know, yeah
I've been working, I ain't perfect
I don't need you to tell me "it's yours"
You know what it is I adore
And something about it that inspires me to hit it more
You told me you coming, well shit I'll just buzz you in
Keys are still under the mat by the door
Ignore the mess
My crib ain't the cleanest from company I had the evening before, yeah

I ain't the only one coming through
Don't act like this body yours
What I do in my downtime
Is what I do in my downtime
We connect, we wanna feel
That shit don't have no meaning
But what you do in your downtime
Is what you do in your downtime
That's everything I know
Girl that's everything I know
Yeah, yeah, that's everything I know
That's the only thing I know

Diving into an ocean
Subtly talking about oral sex
Questioning the commitment in his relationship
I know you think I'm afraid
To take a chance
And go to the deep end
(Usher, baby)
Turn the lights on

These waters can get a little busy
But I got experience (Yeah)
Don't mind trekking through the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me, babe
Shedding all your innocence

I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise, girl, I ain't afraid

It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
And I knew I was ready, baby, uh
To take that dive

Can't help it, no
I want you to feel me
Every little bit of me, baby
I don't need a life saver (Baby)
Baby, going deeper ain't gon' kill me
And I love the rush I get from it

I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise, girl, I ain't afraid, oh no

It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs, uh
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
And I knew I was ready, baby, uh
To take that dive

I'll be inside when the tides are rolling, baby
You'll be my place to hide, all night
All night, babe
I'm not afraid to try
And ooh, I don't mind playing in the rain
And I was hoping that I get to take that dive

It's raining inside your bed
(It's raining and I don't mind if I get wet, baby, yeah)
No parts are dry (Oh)
Loving makes you so wet (So wet)
(Your legs, your thighs) Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
I knew I was ready, baby
To take that dive

Oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh, ready, baby

I, mean, everybody want somebody that's got confidence
You know it's in her attitude
The way she walks, nice legs (Ummm)
She's gotta be beautiful, nice thin waist (Uh umm)
Fat ass (Hahaha), ooh
And them soft little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips

Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
(I wonder if your lips are as soft as I imagine them to be)
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
(Huh, the crazy shit is you the only girl I love)
Little lips, little lips, little lips

I reminisce of all of the things that don't exist yet
Like the breakfast on Sunday mornings after drunk sex
Or when you're out with your girls and you send me a drunk text
Saying "Baby, are you far, want you to come closer to my heart"
I miss you girl, whoever you are

Oh, I miss you, already
And I just wanna kiss you, already
So come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up to the home
You don't know I miss you already
Girl I miss you, yeah

Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips (Ahh, ahh)
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips (Yeah, ooh ahh)
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips (Umm umm, ooh)

Pillow cases covered in traces of your makeup (ahh)
And, if I ever cheat, all she gonna taste is your flavor, real shit, ooh
I dreamt about you last night, I ain't wanna wake up, ahh
Even though I can't see you so far
Looking just like the tint on my car
I miss you girl, whoever you are

Oh, I miss you, already
And I just wanna kiss you, already
So come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up to the home
You don't know I miss you already, I..

I like the way your frame is, uhh
I wonder if your sex is as good as I assume it's gon-na be, huh
The crazy shit is you already knew what it was

Take this, take that girl, but don't take time
To take my heart, baby come claim mine
Won't wait forever but I'll wait for you
Don't take too long girl 'cause I'm missing you

Miss you, already
And I wanna kiss you, already, hah
Come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up, come on home
Girl I miss you, already
I miss you, I do

[Song 56: Can U Help Me]
11 ContributorsCan U Help Me LyricsWhile Usher has tons of songs about loving, it’s rare where a woman doesn’t want his presence. In this song, Usher pleads with his lady as he tries to save their relationship.
Why?
Why?
Why?

Living on the edge, out of control
And the world just won't let me slow down
But in my biggest picture
Was a photo of you and me
Girl, you know I tried
I work hard to provide all the material things
That I thought would make you happy
I'm confused, can you make me understand?
'Cause I'm trying to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool, maybe I was blind
But never took time to see

Can you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you wanna leave
Baby, help me
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And I'm going crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

(Ooh, girl, I love you)
I need you to come back home (you know I need you)
I don't wanna be alone
Why?

Girl, I put your love up on a shelf
And I guess I just left it to die
Now we're not together
'Cause I hurt you too many times
And now you're not around
I wish for every moment of time that got wasted
We used it to make sweet love
Baby, be my guide, please take my hand
Want you to know that I got you if you need it
Don't wanna be on the outside looking in
I gotta have you girl, can't you see

Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave
Baby, help me
'Cause without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you, I think I'll go crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

(Ooh, girl, I love you)
I need you to come back home (you know I need you)
I don't wanna be alone

Please stay, don't go
I don't want it to be over
Give me another chance, I wanna be your man
Girl, you got me down here on my knees
Crying, begging, pleading, I'll do anything for your love

Would you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave (I don't understand, girl, I'm just a man)
Baby, help me
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you, girl, I'm going crazy
Life's a prison without your love
Can you help me?
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Can you help me?
Girl, I'll never stop 'cause you're all I got, baby (please stay, don't go, don't wanna be alone)
Can you help me?
Help me understand, I can be your man
It's driving me crazy (crazy, crazy, crazy)
Oh, baby

Ooh, girl, I love you (said I love you, girl)
You know I need you (I need you)
I can't live without you (I can't go one day without you)
Ooh, girl, I love you (ooh, girl, I need you)
You know I need you
I can't live without you (Can I have you?)
Ooh, girl, I love you
You know I need you
I can't live without you

You know I need you (sing along)
I can't live without you (Yeah, babe)
You know I need you

I'ma meet somebody that's perfect or true, baby
You got me and I got you, baby
Tell your ex it's mine and I won't lose if you choosing, baby
Baby, you know that you're more than just a friend to me
Don't let nobody convince you that we enemies
I was down for the count, I was down we was out
And I stole that, how it would've led to me
You's my little secret
They don't know you freaky, with a chick like you I'm conceited
And when my mama fuck with you and my brother fuck with you
Need the baby in the crib where we completed
You got money, I got money, no competing
F gang but we always on some G shit
I'm on some OJ with the pussy, I'ma beat it
Beep-beep-beep-beep, BJ and repeat it
All the above is the truth
Trust in me like I trust in you
Fuck with me like I fuck with you
How am I real if I ain't real with you?

You the realest bitch out here, we all admit that you the shit
New BMW, new tint so dark the cops gotta squint
So you driving out the city to make money that I'll never let you spend
See that's something broke niggas just will never comprehend
We hit the strip together and we tip together
Hit the lick together, oh
Hit the crib together, book the Ritz together
This is it forever, oh
Hit the jewelry, 3,000 dollar outfit
'Cause I gotta flex for my baby
We just swerved on these hoes
It's adjourned on these hoes, I wanna know

Let me love ya, let me love ya
Let me be the one to, let me be the one to love you
Let me love ya (Baby believe it)

Like a condition, like a religion
So easily mistreated, scary decision
Sometimes it's Hell and sometimes it's Heaven
It's overcomplicated, but, baby

I don't mind
Feelin' like I'm bound to fall
Close my eyes
Baby, I would risk it all, yeah

Sometimes it's tragic, so problematic
People are cryin' for it, people are dyin' for it
Always the reason (Always) we still believe it (These days)
Somethin' that leaves us hurtin' is worth it

I don't mind

Close my eyes

Just to be in love (Love)

Got a crush on a new toy
And boy its never safe
Making all of the bad choices
But its a brighter day

I know that I'm hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
Hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
I know that I'm hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust
Hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust

It's like you gambling, falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose
It's like you gambling, falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose, you gon' lose, you gon' lose
Gambling, falling for me, I'll kill you, you gon' lose it all

I'll send you back and forth, you'll never know you try your luck
They call me Las Vegas, you get what you pay for
Girl, I'm not your lucky card, I'ma make you take a loss
But I am worth it, love's what we wage for

I know that I'm, hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
Hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
And I know that I'm, hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust

I'll kill you, you gon' lose, you gon' lose, you gon' lose
Gambling, falling for me, it could kill you, but you could win it all

[Song 60: Separated]
15 ContributorsSeparated LyricsUsher shows off his lyrical depth with metaphors, telling us how his relationship is best being anything but.
If love was a bird, then we wouldn't have wings
If love was a sky, we'd be blue
If love was a choir, you and I could never sing
'Cause love isn't for me and you
If love was an Oscar, you and I could never win
'Cause we can never act out our parts
If love is the Bible, then we are lost in sin
Because it's not in our hearts

So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off separated

If love was a fire, then we have lost the spark
Love never felt so cold
If love was a light, then we're lost in the dark
Left with no one to hold
If love was a sport, we're not on the same team
You and I are destined to lose
If love was an ocean, then we are just a stream
'Cause love isn't for me and you

So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off separated

Girl, I know we had some good times
It's sad, but now we gotta say goodbye
Girl, you know I love you, I can't deny
I can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I
I know it hurts so much, but it's best for us
Somewhere along this winding road, we lost the trust
So I'll walk away so you don't have to see me cry
It's killing me so, why don't you go?

So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine (hey hey)
Live your life (oh) and I'll live mine (I'll live mine)
Baby, you'll do well, and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off, so much better off
Go your way (go your way) and I'll go mine (I'll go mine)
Live your life (live your life) and I'll live mine (yeah yeah)
You'll do well (oh oh) and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off, so much better off...

So much better off
Separated
I'm sorry we didn't make it

18 ContributorsNeed U (Conversation with Priyanka Chopra) Lyrics
I fucked up
I'm man enough to admit it
(I had it coming)
But I don't know if that makes a difference
(In time I'll show you)
And I know better
If you just give me a chance to explain
(That counts for something, need you)
I was just... I'm insecure...
I need you

How you make it feel
Way you make me feel
Said, it feels so good
I like it, I like it, baby
Girl, what you doing to me?
Girl, what you do to me
Don't give 'em my love
You ain't even like that
What kind of point you tryna prove?
And you hate to admit it
But you still take me back
All that shit you was talking, huh
It don't hold no weight 'cause

You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (In time, I'll show you)
I ain't always wrong, I take the blame (That counts for something)
Man up and say, I own my mistakes
(It's gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Ah baby, I need you, ah baby, I need you
Help me out
Don't let me down

Girl, what I do to you
Girl, what I do to you
Do to make you this cold
Trying to get me where it hit home
You ain't even like that, I know
You ain't mean it, I know, yeah
New friends, you got new friends
They already know who he's hitting
Better answer when a real one calling
You know who it is when you see me calling, huh
Yeah, I know I was wrong, but you know better
Give you up, I would never

You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (In time, I'll show you)
I ain't always wrong, I take the blame (That counts for something)
Yet I, man up and say, I own my mistakes
(It's gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Ah baby, I need you, oh hold me down
Oh help me out

Haven't always done you right and I know it, hah
Girl, I hope it ain't too late for me to show it
(Don't say goodbye)
Forgive me for what I put you through
Let me love you better
All this time (You, were, right)
You were right

You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (In time, I'll show you)
I ain't always wrong, I take the blame (That counts for something)
I'll man up and say, I own my mistakes
(It's gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Ah baby, I need you, ah baby, I need you
Help me out
Don't let me down

Everybody wants somebody that's got confidence
He should make me feel safe, make me laugh
Everything about him should feel sexy
His walk, his talk
He's gotta be effortless, you know?
Not trying too hard
What do you want in someone?

You deserve love, how long are you gon' wait for somethin'?
Nah, we gon find you someone doin' some
Someone rich and single, is Lionel Richie single?
Haha, okay, I'm jokin', I'm kiddin', I'm playin'
At least tell me that you hear all this shit that I'm sayin'
I don't wanna be the only man you laugh with
Life is quick, you should start it happy and end it happy
She ask me "Are you and... happy?"
I never told you what ended up happenin'

As I pretend you haven't made a mess
Of this young man, it's crazy how I degress
And now you got the best of me (Oh)
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me (No)
And now you got the best of me (Oh)
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me

Oh, the world is far from perfect
'Cause I only think of you
But I feel like it is worth it
Everything's movin' in slow motion
Movin' in slow motion

You smile at me, I act like I'm not impressed
You ain't too please, in a place that I can't protest
And now you got the best of me (Oh)
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me (No)
And now you got the best of me (Oh)
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me (Oh)
Inside is bliss, but outside my world's a wreck
'Cause every time that you pass me
I can't help but turn my neck
And now you got the best of me (Oh)
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me (Oh)
And now you got the best of me (Oh)
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me (Oh)

Oh, the world is far from perfect
'Cause I only think of you (Yeah)
But I feel like it is worth it
Everything's movin' in slow motion
It's movin' in slow motion (Oh)

I feel so undeservin' (Oh) of the mere presence of you (Oh)
And my vision, it gets blurry (Oh)
Everything's movin' in slow motion (Yeah)
Movin' in slow motion (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I started believin' that crazy shit she told me
Not sure if that makes me crazy or just lonely
Then I got bored, because fightin' is boring
And she was gone soon as I started stallin'
I don't want it except for when I want it
And even then I beat myself up for it
That's when you hear me say I'm movin' on from it
But it's obviously something else that I want from it
And then that's how she goes about it
It's hard to act like you want it when you know you got it
I'm textin' and callin' like that's my true callin'
And the only time that she's really talking
Is when you she tells me about myself like that's what's important
Startin' things over nothin', that shit is overwhelmin'
Her main problem is she always think I'm up to somethin'
And, shit, talking 'bout it make me wanna fuckin' call her
Reverse psychology, whatever you call it
But to answer the question, yeah, I think we're happy
We're always reunited, that's a good thing, I guess
We're always startin' over, that shit always seems excitin'
I don't know, I guess it's yet to be seen
She's busy doin' her and I'm out here chasin' the dream
Honestly, we say a lot of things that we don't mean
Start happy, end happy, with the summer in between, slow motion

Oh, the world is far from perfect
'Cause I only think of you (Yeah)
But I feel like it is worth it
Everything movin' in slow motion
It's movin' in slow motion (Oh)

Shawty got a body that jeans can't hold
And she moving like she learned everything from the pole
And she loves to party, number one hobby
Out till the morning, better ask somebody (Yo!)

Talk to the girl while he's around (Yo!)
Watch will happen to you when she hear sound (Yo!)
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground (Yo!)
Get a FaceTime, see if she's down
She's a girl from the future
Says she's sick and tired of the old
So all that old shit can hit the road
Man, you only know if you know
'Cause she's...

Hot thing, what’s up with it? (She's so Bubblicious)

Seen her at Laser and she stopped and posed
When she see the green one, she just go, go, go
Like a stolen Bugatti, got money in your pocket
That makes you a Willy pop up when he got a body (Yo!)

Talk to the girl while he's around (Yo!) (Hey!)

Fly, young hot thing, girl, let me cool off
GQ status went and fucked me with my suit on
She a fashion killer and you know I am a shoe hog
Christian Louis Vuitton red bottoms give me blue balls
She fuck me like she know me, then fuck me like she owe me
She told me, then she showed me, then she cuddled like she lonely
All for the love of the Holy Matrimony
But I'm pretty like Tony, and I'm pimping like Goldie (Yo)
How you doing? I'm the motherfucking man
True hot boy, catch me running with the flame
She a hot girl, so she running with the name
Drop, drop it like it's hot, on my motherfucking thing
Mami like a lotta, Papi like the Murcielago
Grada, riding down Mercer
Go Nicki Minaj flow when I hit the verse-uh
If you let me menage, I'll take you to see Usher (Yo)

Talk to the girl while he's around (Gotta talk to her, man)
Watch will happen to you when she hear sound (Hey, when she hear that sound)
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground (Shake it up, let me see you drop down low)
Get a FaceTime, see if she's down
She said, “It don’t really take too much to get me out of control
Maybe you the star, but this my show
Just take a little and I’m good to go"
Yeah, man
You fucking with a...

Hot thing, hot thing

Wanna ride in the Ghost? (Wanna ride in the Ghost?)

Some friends some foes

Had to set some new goals

I was dripping the water out
That would leave a bitch cold (That would leave a bitch cold)
Had to call up the fire department
I was burning up dope (Burning up dope)

Then I went Pluto (Then I went Pluto)
And it could've been perfect timing

Tell me you haven’t been lying

18 ContributorsAll Falls Down Lyrics
Yeah
Real story
Yeah

She built a bridge out of her own insecurities
No one was brave enough to cross except for me
Here I am, yeah
She built a castle from the piece she took from me
I'm going crazy, think she brought out the worst in me
Here I am, yeah

Guess the price was the fall if I get up
'Cause the strong will survive, that don't give up
Where she fell in love, her heart is resting now
Six feet underground

Woah, she feels stupid lovin' me for me, yeah
And I'm the fool who falls too easily
We all fall down sometimes
We all fall down sometimes
So why can't I?
Hey, oh, so why can't I?

You gotta go, I know that time waits for no man
Don't say a word, unspoken, girl, I overstand
Here I am
What do we mean? Some questions don't have an answer
Two out of three, made me a believer
Here I am, yeah

Guess the price was the fall if I get up
'Cause the strong ones survive, that don't give up
Where she fell in love, her heart is resting now
Six feet underground

Oh, she feels stupid lovin' me for me, yeah
And I'm the fool who falls too easily
We all fall down sometimes
Girl, we all fall down sometimes
So why can't I?
Hey, so why can't I?


Woah, she feels stupid lovin' me for me (Oh, yeah)
And I'm the fool who falls too easily
We all fall down sometimes
We all fall down sometimes
So why can't I?
Hey, oh, so why can't I?

When you give it all, you get it all
What happened to you, yeah
From the beginning, knew what I was getting
But I was with it and I'll admit that
She was clear that once I got up in it
Wouldn't be easy for me to let it go
For my time, I got money, but money don't buy time
I got ahead, something got left behind
And the world is yours, just sign this dotted line
And in no time, I had

Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall
Seven Grammys, sold out concerts
Damn, I've been working hard
Private jets to France
Many women, I done had a ball
You can say I made it, but I'm faded

'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah?
Come back
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
What happened to you?
I'm happy for you
What happened to you?

Did what I wanted, freaked all the honeys
I stayed on they mind, mind was on the money
Had whatever, whenever heartthrob forever
Black, young, and clever
When you give it all you get it all
Love would be the only reason to look, baby
But once you turn it on, you can't turn it off
But picture me complaining with all this

Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall
Seven Grammys, sold out concerts
Damn, I've been working hard
Private jets to France
Many women, I done had a ball
You can say I made it, but I'm faded

'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah?
Come back
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
What happened to you?
I'm happy for you
What happened to you?

What sense does it mean to have everything
And nothing at the same time?
Where are you?
I need you, yeah
I'm looking for you
Girl, come and share all this

Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall
Seven Grammys, sold out concerts
Damn, I've been working hard
Private jets to France
Many women, I done had a ball
You can say I made it, but I'm faded

'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah?
Come back
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
What happened to you?
I'm happy for you
What happened to you?

Wherever you are
Things changing time
Wherever you are
Still the same old you
Wherever you are, girl
Wherever you are
I miss you

Just remember that no matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes

Forever yours, here I stand

Ever since you came (since you came along)
It seems like (couldn't get it right)
Yeah, I felt I sunk so low
That there's was no way I could be found (never thought love would find me)
And when we make love (everytime you give, give to me your love)
Give, you make me feel a way I never felt with no one else
And I can't help myself

I'm telling you that no matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing, nothing, baby
Never change the way I feel, I'm your man
Listen, see, forever yours

Is it messed up I hoped you would be here
Only so I could act like I don't care?
Been a blur for the last two months

Got a glass on my lips and a burn in my chest
Got some new fingertips on the back of my neck
Gotta try to pretend, gotta try to forget
Somehow, but how? How?

How we go from strangers kissin' to kissin' strangers?
From not knowing your name to wishin' I could erase it?
Tryna forget with somebody new
That I'm missin' you
How we go from strangers kissin' to kissin' strangers?
From feelin' every high there is to just feelin' anxious?
Tryna forget in a crowded room
That I'm missin' you

All of the nights we stayed up makin' plans
Now I stay up tryin' to understand (Understand)
Been a blur for thе last three months

Got a glass on my lips and a burn in my chest
Got some new fingеrtips on the back of my neck
Gotta try to pretend, I would die to forget
Somehow, but how? How?

How we go from strangers kissin' to kissin' strangers?
From not knowing your name to wishin' I could erase it?
Tryna forget with somebody new
That I'm missin' you
How we go from strangers kissin' to kissin' strangers?
From feelin' every high there is to just feelin' anxious?
Tryna forget in a crowded room
That I'm missin' you

Can't fill that space
With anybody, anybody

[Song 72: Do It to Me]
11 ContributorsDo It to Me LyricsUsher has never been one to shy away from sex, and for someone whose made a career off loving another song for the ladies is second nature to him. Now listen as he teaches the lessons of a lover…
I've got two-dozen roses
And a card that says, "Baby, I can't wait to see you later"
We made dinner reservations
At Nobu, Mr. Chow's, you just pick the location
Now we're sitting at the table, sipping the finest wine
Having a damn good time, I know what's on your mind
I want you, you want me too
Stop fronting, I know exactly what you want, you wanna...

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body, baby, body, baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me, I want you to grab me, talk to me
Tell me how you like it, when you want it, when you all up on it
Do it to me, I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna make this a night to remember

Watching you work the stick in the ride
The motion how you move from third to five
Can't imagine what it’s gon' be once we get inside
And you put that ooh wee on me and you work me the same way
Ooh, I can't wait
(I'm tired of thinking about it, speaking about it
Baby, it's time to be about it
Turn off the lights, tear off your clothes
Jump in the bed and let it flow)
Squeezing, holding, biting, scratching, spanking, screaming
Pulling my hair when you need me
Everything goes, baby, when you...

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body, baby, body, baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me, I want you to grab me, talk to me
Tell me how you like it, when you want it, when you all up on it
Do it to me, I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna make this a night to remember

So long I've waited for this night to get inside you
Look in your eyes and tell you, "Baby, take me, I'm yours"
And if you feel anything like I feel
By the end of the night, I'm certain you'll be screaming for more
I wanna do anything and everything to your body
'Til you break down, can't take no more
From the bed to the floor, to the top of the stairs
You gon' get it, baby
Please, please, oh… do it to me

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body, baby, body, baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me, I want you to grab me, talk to me
Tell me how you like it, when you want it, when you all up on it
Do it to me, I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna make this a night to remember

We got together on his album, got back together on this one. Of course, with the talk of… Read More 

I mean...
Ush, is this what it comes to man?
This how we gon' do it?
I mean, even grass grow, baby, you know?
Seeds become plants, boys become men
What we gon' do? Let's lead the way

Uh, wrapped around all girls like Pashminas
What's my demeanor? The grass is always greener
On the other side, there's thicker thighs, can't give a ring up
I couldn't give a fuck, how could I give a finger?
Let alone half bath and closets
So claustrophobic, in fear of close objects
Now it's sort of like two-car garages
It's like two broads menagin', you're the best, mama

Is there any chance that you remember me being more than just a horrible man?
And would you consider pulling this trigger and taking a second shot at romance? Aw baby
I groomed the days when you were my girl
And I was your man, though I took you for granted
But it wasn't 'til now I see...

How much I miss you
Girl, I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once, here goes the truth
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing

The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best

Remember Mimi or Vita? Remember Iesha or Eva? (I ain't got 'em no more)
Hey, it's for Naomi and Jenny, was the same outcome as Chilli
(Girl, I let 'em all go)
Oooh, no more tricking and kissing miscellaneous chicks acting like a jerk
Woman, I been to church and I talked to the bishop
And he wanted me to share this with you

How much I miss you
I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once, here goes the truth
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing

The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best

Uh, momma try to told me, "Hovi Hov' to slow it down
You gon' lose your best thing if you keep getting 'round"
Like Pac, need a partner when you old to hold you down
Ma, forever young, was forever numb
Sorry Stacy, sorry Dawn, Amil-lion and all of them
All of them was for their time, it wasn't you, it was him
School me once, school me twice, three times, I was dumb
Now it's so plain to see to me I got the one
You're the best, mama

I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing

The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best

[Song 74: What’s a Man to Do]
7 ContributorsWhat’s a Man to Do Lyrics
Listen, I'd be a liar if I told you that I didn't see it coming
Be more of a liar if I said, "Hey, I didn't want it to be something"
You deserve much better for the love that you have shared
I know you won't believe it, but girl, I swear

That I got love for you, big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that you will always be my baby
My baby
But dig the truth, baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?
(Not in two different places)

I know you feel it 'cause you stayed
There is much more to this story
But I'd be a fool to say I trust her and I'm always gonna love her
You know that you don't wanna hear
How I'm living on the edge, baby
So I just say, "Yeah, baby"
She ain't nothing, but she is real
But why I take her through it

When I still got love for you, big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that you will always be my baby
My baby
But dig the truth, baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?
(Not in two different places)

I wanna tell you it's over, that I ain't thinking of her
I wanna really mean it, that I want you to see it
That I'm really trying to leave her behind
And I'm trying not to make you cry
I wanna tell you that I ain't playing games
And I'm dedicated to receive a change
But when I look in the mirror, it's the same old man

That my heart is in two different places (oh)
I got you in my life (my life) and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces (faces)
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?
(Not in two different places)

Not in two different places

Remember that time I was sitting up sick, couldn't sleep in the middle of the night?
You said, "Bae, let me take you to the ER"
I said, "Nah, I'ma be alright"
Well, the next day I found out from fucking around that the sickness I had was life
And I was fixed to keeping the decision to keep it
Knowing I had to get rid of it, rid of it
Live with it, he don't know, you don't know I had to deal with it
You thought what you put me on from Part II was the realest shit
It ain't right, I ain't proud, I won't cry, I can't hide
But when it was you, I was strong
Now it's you, what you gon' do?

I would do anything, to get your trust back
I hid and I know what you mean, and you can trust that
I realize that we're both wrong
And no more lies, we could move on
If you lose that trust you built for so long
Now that's the test to see if you're strong, to see if you're strong
Yeah, that's the test to see if you're strong

You realize what I just told you?
You don't realize it, huh?
Well you can play it back
Yeah, these are my confessions, 'fessions, 'fessions, 'fessions

You ain't gotta holla, you can talk with me
Just try to learn where my thoughts can be and how I stack figures
Learn why I'm real, still that nigga
I get money, I ain't gotta do a crime
Shit, I hit dimes, what I need with a nine
Before y'all judge me, be clear
We got nothing but heat here, beware, we here
What's my name? Got chicks twisted, like, what's my game?
Pimp things still the same
I smash it, I don't harass it
Ma, I'm a baller, I score and pass it
Feel me, still be filthy
If making hits is a crime, I plead guilty
And this is what we came do
Party, Diddy, Usher, game is through, come on

It's right around eleven o'clock
One of your girls just called
Asked you how you look, are you ready?
You tell her you look hot
Not to worry at all
Niggas will be shook, y'all doing it heavy
She's telling you she might change
But you tell her not to
She know that she looks stunning, it'll be fun
The club will be full of game
But none of that has got you
Me, I think you're running 'cause I'm the one

I'm the perfect gentleman in every situation
And the only thing that's missing is the one
Is it you?

Damn baby you're a star, you're smoking

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't keep it together
I usually don't show my emotions
But it ain't getting better
'Cause you can't be blind with eyes wide open

And I see struggle, I see pain
I see only the mess we made
I see things that I can't change
And it hurts my heart to say

I cry
For the sons without fathers
And the pain that their mothers
Hold deep inside
And I'll fight
For the future we're making
It can change if we face it
'Cause these tears won't dry
So I cry

Ooh (I cry)
Ooh

When I look in the mirror
Do I see someone that cares for others?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Do I love myself more than my sisters (Sisters)
And brothers? (Brothers)
I don't know, ooh

Now, I've seen struggles, I've seen pain
I've seen beyond the mess we made
I've seen things that I cannot change
And it hurts my heart to say

Oh, I cry
For the sons without fathers
And the pain that their mothers
Hold deep inside
So I'll fight
For the future we're making
It'll change if we face it
'Cause these tears won't dry
So I cry

Ooh
I cry
Ooh (Cry)

For the truth that's unspoken
For the promises broken
I will stand by your side
I'll fight
For the ones who stopped dreaming
And the ones who stopped believing
You're not alone
I feel your pain

I cry
For the sons without fathers
And the pain that their mothers
Hold deep inside, hey
I'll fight
For the future we're making
Only changes if we face it
It's love over pride
I'll cry

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Song 82: U-Turn]
11 ContributorsU-Turn Lyrics.
Yeah, ayo
2000, it's us
Yo, it's time to U-Turn
You heard me?
You're either with us or against us

It's been some years now
Since we hit the floor to get down
We always had a step to go with the sound
Now everybody wanna sit around, drink and ball
Remember the snake
And how the floor used to clear and everybody would break
What's crunk now used to be called getting to it
I'm bringing it all back, this is how we do it
Just...

Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn

In the '80s, fresh was the talk
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk
In the '90s, I had a high flat top
Doing the wop, Pee-Wee to the Reebok
I can't forget about my high school days
The sound was Bobby Brown, the dance was the running man
Now everybody wanna push Bentleys
The year is 2, everybody, do the U-Turn

Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn (Come on)

All you need to do is let go (All you gotta do)
Let the tempo take over you
I came to have a good time
Let the rhythm deep inside your soul
Let it lead you to the floor (Ah), come on

Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Come on, come on, it ain't hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Come on, come on, it ain't to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn

Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn

Yeah, ahh
They say money can't buy you love
They say money can't buy you love
They never seem to listen
I'm all ears

Just copped your girl a brand new Rolex
But you can never find the time to spend at home
Thinking that's gon' keep her happy
When time is all she wanted all along

It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

So you think that you know what's important
Steady chasing your fame and your fortune
But you don't know you're chasing a dime, losing a treasure
Those dollars don't make sense to me at all
Ooh, it goes (Duh da, duh da)
You give her spending money (Duh da, duh da)
But all she wanna spend is time alone (Tonight)
Keep giving her (The finer things, but)
But she don't really need that (If you don't stop, you're)
You're gonna end up alone (Alone)
In a world without love (Duh duh da, duh da)
Why would you do it?

It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

Listen, stop trying to buy her love
'Cause you won't ever have enough
There's always someone with more than you
You need to pay her attention
Give her what she needs
Do the simple things
Before you lose your girl to me

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeeah
Yeeeah, yeah
Play on, playa
Yeah, your girl coming with me shorty, haha
I'm telling you, man
Cause you know...

It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

You better look out
I hear you talking, I hear you talking, hah
But what are you saying?
Oh hoo oh hooo
Don't be a fool, you got a good thing
Man, are you blind, stupid or crazy?
You got a good thing, uh
You got a good thing
If that's your lady, you better hold on
And give her what she want before she move on
Man, I tell you, cars, clothes, and fancy things don't mean a damn thing
If you ain't kicking it, baby

It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

Don't let this be the thing you'll always regret, no

A foreign beauty so exotic
When she smiled at me, she took my breath away
She's reminiscent of a goddess
It's a shame that we could not communicate
How do I say...

How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
My baby, how do I say, how do I say?
How do I say?

The room was filled with a sweet aroma
When she danced, her hips moved oh so sensuous
She speaks with her body, so hypnotic
In the language that I never will forget

I hear her calling
Spinning around in the crowd till she found me
Then she started moving closer and closer
Does she know that I want her, I want her?
I wanna be with her tonight
So I caressed her face, kissed her lips
All my life, I've never felt quite like this
I've never had a loss for words
One kiss from her has got me speechless

How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mujer bonita, how do I say, how do I say?
How do I say hello? I really wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mon chéri, how do I say, how do I say?

Baby, let's engage in a deep conversation
In the body language we speak, won't need any translation
An odyssey of physical pleasure
As we explore
Together, this universal language of our love
(my love, my love, my love) x2
Can you tell me, how do I put it into words?

How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you

How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?

Every time I look up
I see it in your face, you wanna hook up with me(You know you wanna hook up, stop playing
Instead of acting like you supposed to
You cop an attitude like you're too good for me
And you know good and damn well that

If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby

Ain't nobody trying to clown you
But you're too damn old to play high school games with me
You know that, too damn old
Yes, you do
'Cause even when I'm not around you
I hear from my friends you be asking 'bout me
"What's up with him?" That's what you be saying

I don't really care
How long you've been together with your man
It's just a matter of time
Before I make you mine
I wanna make it clear
So there's no misunderstandings
That I get, what I want
When I want

If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to

If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby

That I get, what I want
When I want
If I wanted to
If I wanted to
I'd have you doing whatever I want you to, you know?
Right now, I'm just not really doing that
But if I wanted to, anything
I'm saying
You and your girls, I could have them too
Listen to me
It's crazy, listen

If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)

Been through hell, now I'm hell proof
Pouring cups of whiskey to get through it
Oh sweet child of mine, gone way too soon
Lost myself and lost my faith too

I've had my share of ups and downs
I've had my share of down and outs
Baptized in a river and almost drowned
That's when I figured out
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now
Stronger than ever now
Ohh

Walk through fire now I'm fireproof
Forever wear these scars like tattoos
Finally found paradise right in my view
And its killing me that I can't share it with you

I've had my share of ups and downs
I've had my share of down and outs
Baptized in a river and almost drowned
That's when I figured out
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now
I'm stronger than ever now, I'm stronger than ever now
(Stronger than ever now)

Though you're gone you still live in my mind
The only thing we ran out of is time
Since you left I ain't been quite the same
I wonder if you miss me, do I make you proud
Know you're watching me, I feel your spirit
I keep you right by my side
I'm stronger than ever now, far from perfect
Life will knock you down, get back up
Fight for whats worth it
Be strong enough, I know its easier said than done

Stronger than ever now
I been through it, now stronger
Stronger now, hey stronger now
All that I been through some how I found my way out
Long as I believe in me, I know I can make it
I know you'll make it, cause you're stronger
Stronger than ever now
Stronger

[Song 92: His Mistakes]
12 ContributorsHis Mistakes LyricsHis Mistakes is the 12th track on Usher’s 5th studio Album, Here I stand.
The song was written by Ne-Yo and a demo version of him singing the song can be found on YouTube.
Do I remind you of the pain
That he put you through, girl?
Is that the reason I'm to blame
Before I do it?
Is it because he treated you badly
I always stand accused?
Protecting yourself from somebody else
I'm not who's hurting you, girl

And it's killing me, girl, knowing
You compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, no, I can't win

I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

He left a scar across your heart
I understand, girl
Don't let his wrongs tear us apart
'Cause girl, I'm your man
Just because he did, you swear I'm cheating
You think I just don't care
Why must I do time for another man's crime?
Girl, you know that ain't fair

And it's killing me, girl, knowing
You compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, no, I can't win

I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

I know he did you wrong
But tell me, what does that have to do with me?
Trying to show you something real
Figure out what is going on
Before you look up and I'll be gone

I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, girl
I love you, and I love you, I love you
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, girl
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

It's been a while now, hope you don't hate me

Ain't been droppin' pins like I used to
Ain't been on savage like I'm used to
Not really tryna say it, but I miss you lately (I miss you)
Wish you was on my time, wish you was by my side (My side)
We be gettin' lit right now, sippin' D'USSÉ right now
Babe, can you forgive me? Stuck in the city
But if we wasn't locked down right now, we be turnin' up right now

How they doin' it in California?
Wanna change the scene, lemme come and join ya
Stretched out at the Hotel California
Girl, I'm tryna meet, I'ma pull up on ya

Stretched out at the Hotel California
If you're tryna see me, I'ma pull up on ya

Gotta watch for the paps and PopAlert (Pop her)
Sit you in a Rolls-Royce, I got the truck (Yuh)
I'm the man of my city, they show me love (Show me love)
Let me speed things up and glitch you up (Uh)
When you see me with my shawty, don't interrupt (Nope)
Palm trees in the back, that's for good luck (Yuh)
Laid 'til the sunset, you tearin' it up (Ha)
Got a question: can I make you mine?
Can I take you courtside to see LeBron?
Can I put you in a condo in the sky?
Can I put your necklace on wintertime
Man, I got a lot ridin' on my line
And I got a lot of money on my mind (Yeah)
Maybe we can go for it, fly you from the south for it
When they open up, I'ma show you how they

How they doin' in California (Yeah)
Wanna change the scene, lemme come and join ya
Stretched out at the Hotel California
Girl, I'm tryna meet, I'ma pull up on ya (I'ma pull up)

Wish you was on my time, wishin' you was by my side (My side)

If we wasn't locked down right now, we be lockin' up right now (Aye!)

Pull up, yeah, yeah, yeah, pull up

Pull up, pull up, yeah, gotta pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, I'ma pull up

16 ContributorsSlow Jam Lyrics“Slow Jam” is covered by Usher and Monica in 1997, when they were both teenagers (18 and 16, respectively).
It was originally sung by Slow Jam in 1983.
I was all alone
I was feeling rather low
I needed someone to lift my spirits up
So I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance
And there this lovely thing was
She was more than enough
I asked her for her hand
Said, "Would you like to dance?"
So pleased that I had asked
She quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam, oh

Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby, for me
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me

Seems what you say is true
I feel the same way too
You see, I've waited all night long
Just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand
I knew you were the man
To turn my world around
And make my dreams come true
The magic in your eyes
Made me realize that everything I feel
Has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam

Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet (Play another slow jam)
On a slow jam
For me and my baby
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and me (Me)

I've been tryna find someone who
I can give my good loving to
Never, ever did I dream I'd find someone, yeah
And I've been trying to find someone, too
I prayed to Heaven and then I found you
I swear, I fell in love the night you danced into my heart

Play another slow jam (Ah baby)
This time, make it sweet (Come on)
On a slow jam
(Can I get a slow jam, do you wanna slow jam with me, baby?)
Play another slow jam (Come on, come on, come on)
This time, make it sweet
(Can I get a slow jam, play another slow jam)
(Are you gonna slow jam?)

Play another slow jam (Dance with me)
This time, make it sweet (Dance with me, baby)

Craving your body all through the night
Feels like I'm going through withdrawals
I wanna hold you
I want you inside of these arms
I'm dying to taste you, I can't deny
Can't get out of my mind
Please let me hold you

Whenever I see you
I just want you around

Constantly thinking of things to do
Places where we can make love
I wanna freak you
I'll freak you wherever you want
Placing my kisses all over you
Caressing you so nice and slow
Oh, how I want you
Girl, there's something I want you to know

Whenever I'm near you

All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you

(Do you get lonely?)
I get lonely

Thinking about you
(Am I the only?)
Girl, I dream of or think of at all
(Are you into me? Out of your mind for me?
Say you can't go a day without me)
Girl, I love you and I want you
And I need you, I need you, I need you

Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around

[Song 99: Lessons for the Lover]
16 ContributorsLessons for the Lover LyricsWith Usher’s vast love experiences, (see here, here, and here), Usher would be the perfect on to teach people the lessons of a lover. It’s not always gonna be the best to learn, but it will have its moments.
Turn the lights on

How could someone hurt you
But still make you feel so good?
Holler, scream and curse you and you stand there and let them do it
Just 'cause he gives you pain, that don’t mean he ain’t the one
Fuck you out your brain, you’ll be smiling when he’s done

So, my advice would be no, don’t leave
Don’t go so easy
Let that argument turn you on
It’s worth it

And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There’s no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you’re in love
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
A lesson for the lover (the lover)

So hard to imagine
Living life without them there
'Cause now you’re so caught up in the passion
But this shit is beyond compare
'Cause don't it make your heart beat, beat, beat like a drum?
You fall hard, but think about how hard you come

So, my advice would be no, don’t leave
Don’t go so easy
Let that argument turn you on
It’s worth it

And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There’s no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you’re in love
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
Come here, look at me

No one wants to be fighting
All day long, all night long
So we'll just scream till we start making love
And as time goes on, we're feeling
Okay, babe, alright, love
And we'll forget about it in the morning

And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There’s no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you’re in love
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
A lesson for the lover (the lover)

I know it's on me, and I can't take it back

The song is filled with a lot of computer themed innuendo, which is actually pretty hilarious.
Oooh, I love the way you dirty type
I can take you home or escape
Oooh, I need your backspace in my life
Thank God you don't have a flat screen

Please, baby I got to see you
I really want to please you

Baby, if you sign on

Oooh, baby if you sign on

I wanted to link up with you baby at first sight
With you I get to use my F-keys
I can't wait to give you megabytes
I got all the memory you'll need
Let my fingers do the talking baby



Oooh, baby you want this I know
I can't wait to give you my hard-drive
My moonlight
If it's all right, baby
I'm always at your window
Ready to shift and control you
If you want me to

He said, "You swear to tell the truth
The whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"
I said, "Yeah, man
Right hand high, never tell a lie"

Y-Y-Your Honor, I didn't know that I hurt her
I didn't know she was crying
I didn't know that it was killing me slow
And-And your honor, she can't say I ain't love her
Can't say I ain't try
But I guess my love wasn't good enough

I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty 'cause girls always wanna show me love
I guess I'm guilty for living and having a little fun
Well, I'm guilty, for that, girl, I'm guilty
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail
Don't take me to jail
(I ain't did nothing to her, gave everything to her
For that)
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail (take me)
Don't take me to jail
(I ain't done a crime, why you make me do the time?)

Your Honor, she accused me of cheating
It was all in her thinking
She gon' believe what she want to
So what the hell am I gon' do?
Turn my life around, it ain't going down
She knew 'bout the life that I live, why she crying now?
This shit is so silly to me, but I won't plead that

I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty 'cause girls always wanna show me love
I guess I'm guilty for living and having a little fun
Well, I'm guilty, for that, girl, I'm guilty
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail (take me)
Don't take me to jail
(How we supposed to get along with her going through my phone?
In her mind, she decided I did it)
Don't take me to jail (don't take me)
Don't take me to jail (don't take me)
Don't take me to jail
(Don't wanna cop a plea, I swear it wasn't me
It don't matter 'cause to her, I'm guilty)

Let's go, right hand to the sky, strike me down if I lie
If she saying she the victim in this case, well, what am I?
If I hurt her, I ain't try to, the club I may decide to
Ride through, she got proof? Well, I got alibis too
A couple million dollar worth of bags and full of shoes
Seven-carat solitaire, Caribbean, water blue
Range Rover, Porsche Panamera, and the Bentley Coupe
All the shit I did for her and this who you gon' listen to?
And her life, I submit to you as evidence, I never been on bullshit
She ain't caught me on no Tiger Woods shit
Knew what I expected when she met me, should have left me then
Balling against the law? Shorty, go on and arrest me then

I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty 'cause girls always wanna show me love
I guess I'm guilty for living and having a little fun
Well, I'm guilty, for that, girl, I'm guilty
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail (take me)
Don't take me to jail
(If you gon' treat me like a crook, putting money on my books
Never mind, forget it)
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail (take me)
Don't take me to jail
(Tired of your little games, fuck it, I'll take the blame
I did it, guilty)

First, see the city skylights shining from my room
You're such a sight to see in the month of June
Beautiful like the moon's reflection when
It's passing off your skin
And before you let me in
I hear you say, "It's been a long time"
I say, "Okay-kay-kay, don't worry, I got you"
Do you say, "How 'bout some foreplay?"
Got that, got plenty, I got you
Do you say, "Play some slow ones"
Got that Sade, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye, too
To love you gently

Oooh, let me love you gently
Lay back, relax, girl I'ma be
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
'Cause daddy know just what you like
Gonna love you gently
(Gonna love you baby, gentle with you baby, ooh ooh)
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

See, I know just when to finish and I know just when to start
And I'll be loving your reaction every time I hit that spot (gently)
Butter soft like leather (gently), but the top is hard (gently)
Whisper your pleasures (gently), then I'll do my job
Invigorating, intense, girl, let me do what I do
I don't know what's echoing louder, the music or you (gently)
I ain't close to be done yet (gently), but you're getting real warm (gently)
Like the calm of the thunder (gently), right after the storm
Do you say, you say, do you say it, girl?
I'm, gonna push it to the limit, oooh
(It's yours, it's yours)
See, second place or win the race, I'm gonna be your number one
(Til the sun shines)
Woooaaah, here comes the sun, get ready babe (forever more)
Let's try and taste the moon again, forever more

Let me touch you gently
(That's the sound of love, ripping shades off the wall)
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
(Ooh, this might not be in the bedroom
But I'm gonna love you, girl, gently)
Gonna love you gently, oooh
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
(Hard as a rock, hard as a rock)
Let me touch you gently (I wanna love you, oohhh, oohhh)
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Gonna love you gently (oohhh, ah babe, ah baby)
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock

Oooooooooh, can you feel me, girl?
Aye, uh huh
We don't need no room
All we need is me and you, aye
Wanna love you

Uh, you got it going on, what what
Uh, you got it going on, what what
C'mon, c'mon, haha

Strictly fuck with those six-digit niggas
If the first one is a nine, they a buck behind
I live my rhyme at the same time, can't find myself laying up
If you ain't paying up, bullets start spraying up
You know my niggas is sick
The game ain't enough for you to run up in this
I need stacks of chips, you know, dream house money
Shit, you just like me, so don't start acting funny

You're the kind of girl that makes
Everybody feel that you're just so damn good
So damn good
But your secrets, I've found out
So don't deny what you're about
I know the truth
You know I do, I do 'cause...

I know you get lonely (Just like me)
And you want it (Just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
I know you get lonely (Just like me)
And you want it (Just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me

Quiet is kept you cry for help
When no one else is there I bet you touch yourself
Does it feel good?
Late night calls, I bet you do it all
Anything to get it off
But you still persist to front on me
Baby, tell me

Why do we play this game of chase
When we know we both feel the same way?
And why do you put me through all these changes
When you know you're just a freak like me?
You're just like me

If I had one wish in the world, I swear to God
It would be for girls to rock pearls, straight out the oyster
Voice your opinion, Queen Bee made a million
Got mirrors on my ceiling, so I can see it
When your head be in between it, if I had a penis
I'd be heartless, for real, though, niggas start shit
I'd just flash out my dildo, y'all move too quick
Thought I'd be memorized by your cocaine bricks
And you smoke gray six, nigga, I thought you was a groupie
Obsessed fan with my pictures in your hooptie
You heard my record, now you know I'm freaky
So you, wanna wreck it and you, wanna see me
How your dreams be, you want me sexual
In a gun fight, two on three, I'm next to pull
And I love life, something you never could imagine
Then you woke the fuck up, it's just rapping

I know you get lonely (Just like me)
And you want it (Just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
I know you get lonely (Just like me)
And you want it (Just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me

Don't front like you don't, you're just like me
Just like me
Just like me
Just like me, yeah
Just like me

Yo!
What's sup?
Hey!
My name is Usher
You can trust there ain't
No punks in this house
And if U really wanna know what my name is!
Just Call Me A Mack
Word
Right!
Just call me the mack
Anytime baby
Cause I ain't confused!

I may be kinda young
But I got a whole lot of man in me
So I'm afraid
That I can't complain (Huh, ha!)
I don't mind
If you wanna come by my crib
And chill
But just be sure
That you call me first
Because the last girl that tried
To just be droppin' on by (Oh, no)
Learned how to play a player
And do you know why
Because the mack

Just Call Me A Mack
Cause I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Or I'll get back with you
It's a well known fact
That I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Just Call Me A Mack!

Now, baby I ain't dumb
And all those silly
Games that U play
I see right through
So let me kick it to yah (To yah!)
I don't have a lot of girls
But I gotta know
I'll get the respect that I give
That's just the way I live
Because the last girl
I had was moving
Things too fast (Slow down)
She tried to pull a fooler
And do U know
What had happened

 2x

The mack is right here
And yes I care as much
Just giving a little love
It's spreading everywhere
You see it's
Here
Here
And here
Catch a feeling
I'm having a little trouble
I know my girl will always
Hit it
Pit it
Like an orange
Cause it looks
Like numbness
My lovin' and
Hugin'
And bitterness
My peeps keep
Pumpin'
Humpin'
On stage
I'm engaged
And yes
The truth is it
You see an
Ugly woman
You better change

Oh, yes
Like Ushers' my name
I can't go changing
My ways (Oh, no)
As long as I'm chillin'
Then baby
You can call me the mack

All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

I feel so strange thinking about you
After all the wrong you've done to me
I can't go on feeling like I do
'Cause my heart loves you, I'm so confused

All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

Don't waste my time
'Cause someone like me you'll never find
I thought we had a good thing
But I was wrong and now I must move on

To another love, one that I can trust
With my heart, I know she'll never run away
Just can't talk no more, so I'm out the door
Talk to me, why you wanna play love games?

All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

To another love, one that I can trust
With my heart, I know she'll never run away
Just can't talk no more, so I'm out the door
Talk to me, why you wanna play love games?

All the time I think of you

Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before

Of you trying to play me out, baby

[Song 113: One Day You’ll Be Mine]
7 ContributorsOne Day You’ll Be Mine Lyrics
Yeah
Check it out
I'm saying
When you gonna be mine?

First time I saw you, baby, you did something to me
That no else has ever done, ooh, ha
It's something in your eyes
Caught me by surprise
And told me that you were the one, ooh-ooh

But what's bad is I know you got a man
And he'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you, ah, baby
Something inside of me
Is saying you and I were meant to be
If you can think it, you can have it
That's why I believe

One day you'll be mine, mine (Ooh baby, ah sugar, no more)
No more creeping (Creeping), sleeping around (Sleeping)
Whispering when he's around (Whispering around)
One day you'll be mine (Said one day you'll be mine), mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering around

Now, every time I see you, baby, it's plain to see
That I'm everything you've been missing at home, baby
So much love to share, it's something in the air
Telling me I should never leave you alone

But even though I know you got a man
He'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you, ah baby
You can try to stop it, but it won't quit
You say you don't when I know that you want it
I know, one day you'll be mine

One day you'll be mine (Oh girl), mine (Said you'll be mine)
No more creeping, sleeping around
Whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine (You'll be mine), mine
No more creeping, sleeping around, girl
No whispering (Ooh), when he's around (Yeah)

One day you'll be mine (One day you'll be mine), mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
Or whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine (You'll be mine), mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
Whispering when he's around

[Song 114: Before I Met You]
15 ContributorsBefore I Met You LyricsOn this track, Usher explains the various ways his relationship with Tameka Foster changed his way of life. Even though he might not be the most fateful, no one can deny they were in love.
Saw you for you
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
You changed my life in so many ways  (would you remember, remember, remember, remember)
I just think back to  (would you remember, remember, remember, remember)
How I used to be and how you dealt with me (would you remember, remember, remember, remember)
Just want to thank you

Just in case I never see your face again
Just in case the worst was meant to happen
Just in case tomorrow never come, there is something you should know (should know)
I've given you every bit of the man I am (the man I am)
I know at times, it wasn't pretty, but it was all I had
I never held back, not one little bit, and the world can attest to this
And baby, you flipped my program upside down (upside down)

(Listen to me now)
I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something (before I met you)
But how you made a (difference), look what I've been (missing)
You got my life (together) and I thank you (forever)
I really used to throw a lot (before I met you)
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

There was so many times I wasn't there for you
And for everyone of those times, I hated myself for
The way I went about it, the ups and the downs
One foot in, while the other foot's out
Loving on you, loving on another
But I ain't no different from any other brother
So what I give to you right here, right now
In this here place (is my voice, say it out)
In this here space (let my heart pour out)
As I state my case, as I break it down
To tell you where I'm coming from so you've seen the good you've done
So you've feel the change you've made, stay with me every day

I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something (before I met you)
But how you made a (difference), look what I've been (missing)
You got my life (together) and I thank you (forever)
I really used to throw a lot (before I met you)
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

Girl, if I died tonight before I wake
Know that you touched my life in oh so many ways
And sugar, if this song is I had to give, would you remember?
Remember my heart, remember it was good
Remember that I tried as long as I could
Remember that I gave 'til I had nothing else
Remember my voice

I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something (before I met you)
But how you made a (difference), look what I've been (missing)
You got my life (together) and I thank you (forever)
I really used to throw a lot (before I met you)
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

Remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember

[Song 115: Mind of a Man]
9 ContributorsMind of a Man Lyrics
That night I said I was recording late
I wasn't recording late
I was just smoking, chilling, had a couple drinks
Not much of anything
And that time I flew down to the MIA
Then I went MIA
I hit up KOD with a few bands to play (hold up)
And that ain't everything
All I think about is bitches, umm
And everywhere I go they come
Double standards let everybody talk 'bout it (shit)
The tables turned around, I be throwing up six
So I ain't trying to justify
All I do
So tired of lying
All I do
All I do

1 ContributorI Want You Back LyricsReal talk, Usher, just blaze, you know
Oh, oh
(You, you're gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
(You know you're gonna need me)
And now that day's here, you man gotta shed tears, right
(You're gonna want me back)
You never miss a good thing till it leaves you
Finally I realize that I need you
I want you back, baby girl I need you back
Gotta have you back, babe
Heartbroken when you left my world
Man I wish I woulda kept my girl
And I love you
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my baby
It's driving me crazy
'Cause I'm missing my baby
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
Oh, I just wish I could find you girl, oh
Said I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
I'm goin' outta my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now
Aw baby, what you say now?
(You're gonna want me back)
And still I want you, want you
Want you, want you, want you, need you, babe
If I could rewind the time
And get inside your mind
I would take back all my words
(You're gonna want me back)
I didn't see it, I couldn't see what I was doin', babe
See baby girl I was blind
And I wish I could try
To be the man that you deserve
(You're gonna want me back)
Give me one chance to make it work
Ah, baby, you're driving me crazy
'Cause I'm missing my baby
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
Oh, I just wish I could find you girl, oh I
Said I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
I'm goin' outta my head, all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now, oh
(You're gonna want me back)
Wish I could throw it back
I want it the way it use to be
(You're gonna need me)
Oh, oh
(You're gonna want me back)
Give me one chance to make it work
It's driving me crazy
'Cause I'm missing my baby
I'm goin' outta my mind, I'm runnin' outta time
I just wish I could find you girl, oh baby
Said I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
The love of my life
But I wasn't loving you right, baby
It's driving me crazy
'Cause I'm missing my baby, yeah
(You're gonna want me back)
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
I just wish I could find you girl
So I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
(You're gonna want me back)
I'm goin' outta my head, all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now
(You're gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
And that day's here
(You're gonna want me back)
And ya man gotta shed tears, I'm sittin' by the phone
Realizing she ain't ever coming home
(Oh, ooh, you're gonna need me, need me one day)

[Song 117: I Can’t Let U Go]
11 ContributorsI Can’t Let U Go LyricsUsher’s caught up in a failing relationship. With it being so new to Usher as he usually has a good time and has no problem cutting ties with women, this is a rarity. Sadly, this wouldn’t be the last time.
Yo
I'm sick of this, man
I can't even take no more
'Cause I hate the fact that I love you so much
And you know what I'm saying?
You don't even understand what this is doing to me
Every time I try to get away, I just can't let you go
You know what I'm saying?
I just can't let you go

I never ever wanna hurt you, I just wanna love ya
I just wanna sex you up
I wanna give you everything you need, -thing you want
Just lay down and let me love you all night long
It was beautiful when we first started
I don't wanna leave you, I just wanna keep you
When they saw me, they saw you
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl
That's how I felt
Every time I thought it was right, it went left

We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue (What happened to all the good times)
I tell myself that I don't want you no more (Girl)
But I can't let you go (You see, I can't let you go)
So much love and hurt and hate (I hate this)
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave (See what I'm saying?)
But I can't let you go

Now you wanna be real insensitive and try to act kinda funny, man
You know what, man?
You ain't even gotta wait till in the morning, man
You can get out of here tonight, man
Hey, yo, Glen, come grab her shit and get her out of here

Baby, you ain't even gotta like me, but you're not gonna fight me
You can't walk away and say
I never gave you everything want, -thing ya need
All we ever do is argue all night long
I don't wanna leave you
See you with another brother loving you
Saying "damn the world, it's me and my girl"
That's how I feel when you think everything is real
But it really ain't

We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go

Got me walking around, ready to snap
Got me walking around, looking for somebody to slap
Got me going, going with no pause
Got me up in Cartier everyday just 'cause
Got me arguing about little stuff she don't call little stuff
It get a little rough, then we kiss and make up
She wanna say what she wanna, I don't play that
She wanna constantly bring up shit from way back
Got me thinking about her while I'm watching a flick
Got me dipping through traffic, trying to get home quick
Got me talking to myself, I'm hating this
Got me wanting to wild out like I'm Jadakiss
Got me in a place I never thought I would see
Got me not wanting to stay, not wanting to leave
Got me happy, got me confused
Got me wishing I could get it how I used to

We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go

[Song 119: Foolin’ Around]
11 ContributorsFoolin’ Around LyricsThis song is basically saying that he’s in love with her but he can’t stop cheating on her so he’s leaving her simply because of the fact that he doesn’t want to hurt her anymore
I know I vowed to never do this again, but, uh
I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at
Got something that you need to know
Be the realest shit I never wrote
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note
Yeah, yeah, listen baby

Let me start by saying that the way I feel for you has never once changed
And the games I played, mistakes I made leave me sorrier than you'll ever know
We got a problem, baby, I can't lie
'Cause lately, I realize that I
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)
Knew that it was wrong, but we (let it be)
And I know you never knew when you said I do
That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)

And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

Trade memories for moments, trade love to be lonely
Guess that's just the man in me, blame it on celebrity
When the night time feel like the right time
And that spotlight feel like the right light
When it's really just my fears and I still don't dry your tears
When I say, "She ain't you and I really love you more"
And you say, "If it's true, why you do it for?"
And I, I really don't have no excuse
I break your heart, make you cry, I just wanna say goodbye

And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

What I feel, I don't even gotta write it
It's like poison in my body and there's no way to deny
That my heart is a time bomb with seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows
That it ain't on you, it's my fault
All the gossip and talk, behind your back when you walk
By the time you will know, before long you will see
That you deserve more, you deserve more
You deserve so much more than what I'm offering

And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

Live with this
Can you live with this, girl?
I just want you know
Got something that you need to know
This be the realest shit I never wrote, uh
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, umm umm

12 ContributorsRed Light Lyrics
It's crazy
I can't believe that you
Would be the one to do
Do me like you do
Get back here, baby

When you let me have my way
I was thinkin' I could get it again
Baby, we could be friends if you're lonely
And then you showed me just how quick your tires could spin
You were off in the wind, tell me, where did you go?

When you left, I'm thinkin', "Which way did she go?"
I shoulda known that you led me on, girl
I'm in the wind on cruise control
I gotta be dreamin' 'cause I never felt like this before

It was supposed to be just the one -night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sittin' here at the red light
Drivin' 'round, lookin' out for her
It was supposed to be just the one-night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sittin' here at the red light
Drivin' 'round, lookin' out for her?

Now it's rainin' and I'm lookin' over at the passenger side
Thinkin' back in my mind how you set me off
She was stoppin' and droppin' me, switchin' from fast to slow
But that had nothin' on how you got when I got you home

When you left, I'm thinkin', "Which way did she go?"
The way you touched yourself had me up the wall
I'm in the wind on cruise control
I'm searchin' for you 'cause I can't seem to let you go

It was supposed to be just the one-night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sittin' here at the red light
Drivin' 'round, lookin' out for her
It was supposed to be just the one-night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sittin' here at the red light
Drivin' 'round, lookin' out for her?

You know
I really only thought
That this would be a one-night stand
What you doin' to me?
Come on
What you doin' to me?

Maybe she's runnin' home to someone else
Or maybe she lost my number in her cell
Or maybe she's run it down like this before
'Cause I can't see her not comin' back for more, more

It was supposed to be just the one-night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sittin' here at the red light
Drivin' 'round, lookin' out for her
It was supposed to be just the one-night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sittin' here at the red light
Drivin' 'round, lookin' out for her?
It was supposed to be just the one-night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sittin' here at the red light
Drivin' 'round, lookin' out for her
It was supposed to be just the one-night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sittin' here at the red light
Drivin' 'round, lookin' out for her?

Anytime I could just lose control, caught up
In your loving, everytime I feel your touch
Second thoughts, more doubts started building up

You're everything I wanted
Before I knew just what I wanted
And hey, hey, you're killing me on the inside
And you're the only one I want, I can't deny

Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
(Do I) take your hand or let it go?
(I can't) take this feeling much more
(Do I) take your hand or let go? (Go)
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I go?

Hey, I feel like I just blow on up
Every time I feel your love, I get so caught up
It's your kissing, your touch, it's just everything
But I'm feeling like I wanna just run away

I'm here to tell you what I want
But you're everything I want
And hey, hey, it's killing me on the inside
'Cause you're all I ever wanted, so I can't deny

Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
(Do I) take your hand or let it go?
(I can't) take this feeling much more
(Do I) take your hand or let go? (Go)
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I go?

Somebody tell me (Oh)
Is it that I'm so wrong? I can't say (say)
Or is it my life? So young, careless ways
And in your eyes, so much love you wanna give
But the more I hold you in my arms
The pressure starts to build (Build)
Build it up (Build, build, build)

Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
(Do I) take your hand or let it go?
(I can't) take this feeling much more
(Do I) take your hand or let go? (Go)
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let go?

Every time I look at you
There's so many things that I wanna do

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
This one's for the lovers
Follow me

Clearly, this is new for me
I get excited when you're here, my dear
Make no mistake, you are all I see, sugar
My visions never been so clear, hah
We both know that I've been running so long
This time, love won't let me leave
Please be patient, hesitation aside
We're almost where we need to be
But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind

Baby I, I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know

Think back to the time
When I was scared to let it show
Having too much fun, this and that or what
Now that you're mine
Ha, yeah, somewhere along the way, everything fell in place

I'm so proud of how you represent me, baby
Whether rocking Armani, Dolce Gabbana
Roberto Cavalli, Louie, or Gucci, girl
No matter what you wear, you do your own with it
I'll feel the same years from here
But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind
Ooh, listen

I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know
That I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know

You know I need you baby, you know I do
I need you baby, you know I do
I need you baby, you know I do
Know I need you baby

You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know
I think we've got something special

I'll never, never let you go, no

8 ContributorsOn the Side Lyrics
I know that it's wrong, but it still feels so right
I'm in love with a girl that I see on the side
We both know the truth, but I still tell a lie
I'm in love with a girl that I see on the side

We be talkin' through DM now
Finally, I know all her friends now
Got me a girl and she got her nigga
He never stood a chance, he don't give what I give her
Don't say nothin', we keep it private (Shh)
PDA, it ain't a option, no
But I'm a different person every time I get with her
I mean, I love my baby, but she way thicker

I introduce her to things that she ain't used to
I got a woman, but baby, don't wanna lose you
That's what I want and everything that I need, oh

I know that it's wrong, but it still feels so right
I'm in love with a girl that I see on the side
We both know the truth, but I still tell a lie
I'm in love with a girl that I see on the side

We got the late-night textin'
If we keep all this up, both of our mains gon' turn to exes
When we so reckless
She come and see me in Atlanta, we rendezvous in Texas
Sendin' me pictures with her clothes off (Off)
Why she gotta be such a show off? (Yeah)
Step outside to take a phone call
She tellin' me she ready (Bet)

Ooh, I introduce her to things that she ain't used to
I got a woman, but baby, don't wanna lose you
That's what I want and everything that I need, ooh

I know that it's wrong, but it still feels so right
I'm in love with a girl that I see on the side
We both know the truth, but I still tell a lie
I'm in love with a girl that I see on the side

It's too late for me to slide out
I can only hope my baby don't find out
You can only hope your nigga don't get wise
That I'm the one you seein' and receivin' on the late nights (Woah)
Yeah, we cuttin' it close
Runnin' out of alibis, it's just a matter of time
Steal her heart, don't wanna let it go
So we gon' have to keep it our secret

I know that it's wrong, but it still feels so right
I'm in love with a girl that I see on the side
We both know the truth, but I still tell a lie
I'm in love with a girl that I see on the side

Tell me what's wrong dawg, what the hell you damning about
I'm your homie so just say what's on your mind
Man I didn't know that you where talking about her
So man your telling me you know her
I know her like a pastor know his word

We messing with the same girl (same girl) same girl
How could the love of my life, and my potential wife be the
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Man I can't believe that we've been messing with the
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Thought she someone that I can trust
But she's been doubling up it on us
You can't, man we've been messing with the same girl

See I met her at this party in Atlanta
Well I met her at this party in Chicago
She came right up to me given me conversation
I said do you got a man she sad no, with no hesitation
Well it must be a music thing 'cause she said the same to me
With a party all in my face, when I'm laughin' and buyin' her drinks
And she whispered in my ear and said can you take me home
Me too
Man she was in the Chi singin' that same song
Is that true
And I thought it was true confession when she said
I love you
Man I thought her body was calling when she said
I want you
Look I even got some pictures on my phone
Look at there how she's is with some boys shorts on

We messing with the same girl (same girl) same girl
She's the apple of my eye, and my potential wife
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Man I just can't believe that we've been messing around with the same damn girl
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Thought she was someone that I can trust
But she's been doubling up with both of us
You can't, man we've been messing with the same girl

Said she got me on ringtone
Are you talking about the pink phone
Mm-mm the blue one
Man she told me that one was turned off
It's obvious that she's been playing us playing us
Or constantly she's been lyin to us lyin to us
Don't like the way that she's been goin bout it goin bout it
Kels what do you think that we should do about it do about it
Well call her up at her home, she won't know that I'm on the phone
Yeah man that's the way
Homie we about to bust this trick
Man just ask her to met up with you and I'm gonna show up too
And she won't know what to do
Well be standing there singing

Same girl (same girl) same girl
She's was the apple of my eye, and your potential wife
Same girl (same girl) same girl
I just no can't believe that we've been messing with the same girl
Same girl (same girl) same girl
She gonna be lookin so stupid when she see us together
You can't, man we've been messing with the same girl
See she was taken flights going back and forth
I would pick her up at the Airport
Man I really can't believe it (Same girl same girl same girl)
Oh can't believe it no
Hey'. The same girl (same girl) the same girl

[Song 134: Appetite]
15 ContributorsAppetite LyricsWhile Usher was in a happy and healthy relationship, his inner playa haunts him to continue hunting new women.

Usher, Usher
Yeah, man
True story
Real G's with me on this one
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Wifey home, wedding band, I'm a lucky man
You'd think I'd be satisfied and truthfully, yes I am
But lately, only late at night, I find it hard to sleep
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets
My Mac is in my backpack, I'm surfing on the sites
I'm chatting, this ain't cheating, just telling myself a lie (oh)
And it's almost like I'm caught up and living another life
Man, I'm hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite

Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I almost zoned, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

I'm not trying to be late, rush through security gates
With weather in Atlanta, all outgoing flights delayed
No rooms left in the Mandarin, I gotta figure out a play
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way
We started talking business, she handed me a card
We exchanged information, I rented me a car
While I'm driving, she calling, I'm thinking this is how it starts
Fine as hell, but I don't wanna break my baby's heart, no, no

Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I almost zoned, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

They call me U-S, H-E-R, R-A, Y-M, O-N-D
And I just wanna do right by my lady
But lately, I been slipping up
Fantasies 'bout dimes on the side, dark tint on my ride
I got a 10 in my ride, I can hide, I can't lie, lie
But ever since I put that band on my hand, goddamn
More tricks trying to get at me than I know what to do
Just trying to handle my grown man B.I
Got a girl I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose
Break her heart, I do want to do
I don't want to be that fool, make that move
Bend them a bit, but never break the rules
Bend a bit but never break the rules

Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I almost zoned, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

She got the door locked and the lock don't fit your key
Yeah, you punching the wrong numbers in the ADT
You'll be wondering how the hell I let this happen to me
Better not feed, feed, feed that appetite
Now your baby's gone, you putting out an APB
And some other brother been tossing up your PYT
Get caught slipping you gon' wish you would've listened to me
Brother, don't feed, feed, feed that appetite

Usher, Usher

Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Nu Soul)

Now you say I must be out my mind
But I can't help but see love is blind
Open your eyes, take good advice
Still got time left to walk away
In hindsight, I realize
But if you ask me today what made me stay
I'd say that

I wanted to believe
I wanted us to make it, baby
I wanted to believe
I was looking forward, baby
To everything you said in every way
But fuck what people say
Is this real?
Can you make me believe in love?

I was in love with her, yeah
You was in love with him, huh
I thought I wasn't
'Til we fucked up and cheated on both of them
The beginning of the end of love for us, listen, huh
I've been trying, I've been dying
I've been buying ever since
Nothing ever come with ease, this feeling inside of me
Got a nigga on his knees, all because he wanted to believe it

I wanted to believe, oh
I wanted us to make it, baby
I wanted to believe (Yeah yeah)
I was looking forward, baby
To everything you said in every way, yeah
But fuck what people say (Yeah, yeah)
Is this real? (Is this real?)
Can you make me believe in love?

Uh, I was in mode, I was like "Hold on, fuck what people say, uh"
We was on road, so I was like "No, she would never act this way, uh"
I was like "Yes", she was like "Go", I was like "Tell me which way"
Blinded by the thought and prayed on and now I regret this every day
One, we been headed down the wrong path
Phase two, everybody predicted that this shit wasn't gon' last
They knew and I did too, I was so determined to pull this through
I was so determined to win with you, I was so addicted to fix this shit I had to prove

I wanted to believe
I wanted us to make it, baby
I wanted to believe
I was looking forward, baby
To everything you said in every way
But fuck what people say
Is this real?
Can you make me believe in love?

Oh-oh-oh
Believe in love (Give a fuck what people say, ah, ah)
Can you make me believe in love?
Oh, baby, oh-oh-oh
This is real love
You do it for love, wanna believe (You do it for trust, ah, baby)
You did it because you let your guard down, down
Oh no, oh no

You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?

You introducing shit, you know I don't play
You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I'm suffering from delusion, I should put myself away

All the time and money I've spent
Can't believe what I'm in, it ain't right
If I come back, do you promise it's gon' be you and me and the sea?
"Whatever"
No?

You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?

You introducing shit, you know I don't play

How come I every time my crew around
Just so happen you around, you got to show out?
It ain't right
And all that flinging your hair, glossing your lips
Shaking your hips every time you go out

You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?

Hey, all the girls, all the girls
Make sure your skirt ain't too tight
What we doing is gon' have a lot of fun
With me and you, tonight, come on

You gotta twist it to the left and twist it to the right
Twist it like you love it, go twist that thing all night
Twist it to the left and twist it to the right
Twist it like you love it, yeah, twist that thing all night

She felt so alive, said her home life was so dead
Twenty of us on Vespas and Mopeds
Oh, there she go in there, oh, can I hold that?
What you talking ‘bout? Go ahead, forehead
Told her homegirl, now it’s getting worse and
And I was trying to hook her up with Usher
So I gave her that white Chanel lipstick
She said “How you get more out?” Twist it

You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?

You introducing shit, you know I don't play
So glad you had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way

What more could I do?

Girl, you can keep that
Trying to make me jealous
I admit that I've been careless
But we can't take back what's done
I know why you did that
You're frustrated 'cause I don't react
Maybe you want some feedback
'Cause normally my feelings don't show
But baby...

I care for you
By now you should now that I care for you
You say my actions never show it
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get's what you see
The truth is, girl, underneath
Gotta believe that I care for you
Baby, I care for you
I, I, I, I care
I, I, I, I care for you

Every day, I'm
Trying to prove myself to you
But what's the point?
No such thing is satisfying you
Maybe you'll appreciate it later, by the time I'm gone
Better get your act together, don't wait too long
Don't wanna change what we have to what we had
Girl, I need you to know that I...

I care for you
By now you should now that I care for you
You say my actions never show it

Walking with my head down
Counting every step
Hoping that the next one
Brings me closer to the man I was
'Cause I was way better
Maybe it's because
We were together

I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into

You (Looking for myself)
You (I, I-I, I-I-I)
You (looking for myself)
And somehow, I ran right into you

Escaping on the tightrope
Trying not to fall
If I don't keep my balance
I know I will lose it all
I should have known better
And it's all my fault
That we're not together

I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into

You (Looking for myself)
You (I, I-I, I-I-I)
You (looking for myself)
And somehow, I ran right into you

I was on a journey
Trying to figure out who I really was
Then I realized that
When you're not here
Half of me is gone
So in order for me to find me
I had to find you
You know? (you...)
And I got a funny feeling that (you...)
You won't know who you are
And unless you find me (you...)
It's like...
You look in the mirror (you...)
And you see the person that you truly love

I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into

You (Looking for myself)
You (I, I-I, I-I-I)
You (looking for myself)
And somehow, I ran right into you
You (Looking for myself)

Nah-nah, nah, nah, nah

See, around here, we're just too much

Real fly, unforgettable-type **** (Uh)
See, all I do is keep hitting them up
Getting them up, shaking your butt, ****, what

Keeping it live (Ooh)
When you wanna make them jump, you know what to do
Call me and my crew to the rescue (Da-dun, da-dun)
Captain So-So Def
We rocks the party 'til there's no one left (Ooh)
Turn your volume up a notch (Uh, huh)
And watch the ba-bomb, bump-bump-bump make your speakers pop

I never missed my woman 'til she said goodbye
Now my heart's made a change
My whole world's rearranged
And I'm ready to give you what you deserved

I don't think that you know how much I really love you

All I do (All I do) is think of you
I can't eat, can't sleep, baby it ain't hard to see
All I do
All I do is think of you
And your bump, diggy-bump, bump, bump
Diggy, diggy, bump, bump, baby

[Song 144: Lay You Down]
5 ContributorsLay You Down Lyrics
We got all night, baby
Yeah, I'ma take my time with you
Now, listen
You know how daddy like it
I'm here to see you, momma
Just let me do me, all right?

Maybe it's the pressure of knowing that I'm watching you perform
Or maybe you're not used to someone who knows exactly what you want
I know the fire's burning, but baby, there's no need to be alarmed
And you can be the rain that's falling, girl, and I'll be the thunderstorm
You got no need to be nervous
Because you are safe in my hands
I'm sure you'll be needing my service
Baby your wish will be my command

'Cause I'ma touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is
If you let me lay you down

I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in here

When you're cold, I wanna be the one that keeps you warm
I'll make your body come to me, pull you back when you try to run, baby
Baby, I'll go deeper, open up if you're ready for me to feed you
Yeah, tell me who you are (let me taste it, can I take it?)
It's going down right here

'Cause I'ma touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is
If you let me lay you down

I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in here

All that I want
Is to squeeze you, touch you, kiss you, baby
And I'll provide you with that
Special kind of loving
You ain't gon' want nothing but me
You ain't going nowhere
I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down

I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going
No, you won't be sorry
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in here

Made you majesty, it's riveting

[Song 146: Burn (Full Phatt Radio Mix)]
3 ContributorsBurn (Full Phatt Radio Mix) Lyrics
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Sending pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself calling her your name
Ladies, tell me do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back?
Oh oh oh oh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burning till you return (let it burn)

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (can you hear me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burning till you return (let it burn)

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Re-introduction to a feeling I don't wanna know
Yeah, I've been running, but it caught me somehow
The rule was never fall in love, I did it anyway
You make my heartbeat keep pumping
Why the hell you turn it up so loud?

'Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
It's just you and me together
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

Here we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

I went in all the way, I thought I could get in and out
She said, "Relax, you gonna be here for a while"
But I threw caution to the wind and did it anyway
And the truth is, I'm learning to love it and I ain't gonna turn it down

'Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
Once the music sets you over
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are

Here we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

My sons, keep them
Please forgive me

Whoa, now, I think this woman went and put a hex on me
Whoa, now, why'd I let her go and put that sex on me?
Whoa, now, I probably shouldn't have watched that girl undress for me
The scent of her perfume in the air
Got it feeling different in here, yeah

She took my breath away
On to some fancy ship
Into another place
Such an expensive trip
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money

It’s the sins of my father
He left the debt to his son
To pay the girl who’s a mother
Collector won't let me run, no
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father

Whoa, now, she’s speaking in a tongue that sounds new to me
Whoa, now, mama told me what this could do to me
Whoa, now, I wouldn’t fall for something like this, usually
Tell me how could I ever prepare
If my papa never was there?

She took my breath away
On to some fancy ship
Into another place
Such an expensive trip
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money

It’s the sins of my father
He left the debt to his son
To pay the girl who’s a mother
Collector won't let me run, no
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father

(Father)
Hurt me, please me, yeah (father)
No, I don’t deserve the debt that came with my birth (father)
No, why have I been pretending this is something that that man come up with?
I’m praying I reverse this curse

It’s the sins of my father
He left the debt to his son, hey
To pay the girl who’s a mother
Collector won't let me run, no
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father

Protect the shit everybody don't get to see

You can have anybody, but you're here with me

The game 'bout to change, Usher
Whoa, man, y'all are something else
Yeah, a lot of women
You know they say y'all do it better than us
(And I learned from the best, man)
Because we only see what you're doing
But I see you
Where we at?
This right here is for my triple G's with the double Ds
Hah, go get 'em, girls
You know who you are
Where we at?
Over here looking how we looking, ain't that right?
Go get 'em, girls
I see you

I profess, I'm a lover, minor scholar of anatomy
Doctor of feminine chemistry
Got a healthy fascination for a multitude of relation
With plenty women that's still on their feet
And it happens that every once in a while
I go too deep that I gotta shut it down
She keep on coming by, won't quit calling
It's safe to say that she's falling
She pleading, she don't want me to leave
I had to tell her

No, no, no
She keep on begging for more
No, no, no
She said you don't love me no more
That's when I be like

Loving me, baby, that's a no-no
I'm better when I touch and go
I'm trying to add your name to my hall of fame
Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, lover
(Not a lover baby, yeah, yeah man)

As a quid pro quo, we can both come and go
This ain't about fidelity
Thought I was a pimp, player, hustler, baller, huh
Whoa, man, she a G and do it better than me
(You do it better than us, baby)
And it happens that every once in awhile
She gon' cook just to hook you for a while
Can't escape, take your pick, either way, you're a trip
'Cause man, if she laying for it, that means you paying for it

No, no, no
She keep on begging for more, yeah
No, no, no
She said you don't love me no more
That's when I be like

Loving me, baby, that's a no-no

Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, lover

Tick-tock, better hurry, time's running out
(So you better be sure before we lay down)
Knock-knock, daddy's home, open up, girl
(I can tell that it's been awhile, you've been waiting)
Through it so many times (with women that I do it for)
Ain't trying to make you mine (but I like the feeling)
Let's both be honest here, baby
We don't go through drama here, baby
'Cause when you give it up
You gon' get addicted and go crazy and lose your mind
How many of you like that?
Keep on asking me for more (more, more, more, more)

Loving me, baby, that's a no-no
I'm better when I touch and go
