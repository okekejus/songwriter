[Song 1: Gin and Juice]
174 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolGin and Juice Lyrics“Gin and Juice” is Snoop Dogg’s depiction of the more laid back side of the streets. It has arguably one of the catchiest hooks in all of hip-hop and is symbolic of what the G-funk is all about.

(Ahh) Hahaha, I'm serious, nigga
One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath (Oh, man)
Ayy, baby, ayy, baby (Shit)
Ayy, baby, gimme some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin', haha
Ride with me to get somethin' to eat, dog, ayy, nigga
Study long, study wrong, nigga

With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something (Yeah)
For the Gs and make a few ends (Yeah)
As I breeze through? Two in the mornin'
And the party's still jumpin' 'cause my mama ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on, and
They ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin' (Six in the mornin', six in the mornin')
So what you wanna do? Shit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (But what?) we don't love them hoes (Yeah)
So we gon' smoke an ounce to this
Gs up, hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You gotta get yours, but fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drank to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch?)
Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch, "Please
Raise up off these N-U-Ts, 'cause you gets none of these"
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze biatch, I'm just

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke, shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raising up out the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Biatch
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Biatch
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

[Song 2: Young, Wild & Free]
116 ContributorsYoung, Wild & Free LyricsThe lead single from Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa’s film Mac and Devin Go To Highschool.
The song features a drum sample from Tom Scott’s “Sneakin' in the Back.”
Is this thing on? Word

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees (Shit)
So what we go out? (Ayy, lemme get a lighter, please?)
That's how it's supposed to be ('Cause you know I'm high as fuck and I forgot one)
Living young and wild and free (Keep that in there)

Ah, ah-ah
So what, I keep 'em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not carin' what I show
Keep it real with my niggas, keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

You know what? It's like I'm seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face, lookin' on the case
Tryna find a hella taste, oh, my God
I'm on the chase, Chevy, It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like, "Khalifa put the weed in a J"

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh, and I don't even care
'Cause if me and my team in there
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em, Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Uh, now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this, you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun
So we just roll one, smoke one
When you live like this, you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

You're back now at the Jack Off Hour
This is DJ EZ-Dicc
On WBallz
Right now, something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow-wow-wow
'Cause we gon' make it a little misty in here tonight
This is DJ EZ-Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass with a fat dick
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you, lady
But now I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
I gets loced and loony, bitch, you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin' that I learned in Tha Pound, so how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho?
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothin' else to do with it, pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt, ho, you'll never be my only one
Trick-ass bitch

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth?
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger (Uh-huh)
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Named Snoop Doggy? I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it, 'cause you know I don't love it

Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '6-4 rag to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'
Just get on your knees, and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout (Woo)

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Yeah, okay there he go
Ayy man, you Snoop Dogg?

Nigga
Yeah, motherfucker
Yeah, nigga, one less nigga (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, nigga, you's a dead motherfucker now

As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they break in tryna save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn, I see demons
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I can't die, my boo boo's 'bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better
How long will I live? Eternal life and forever
And will I be the G that I was?
I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes, my son, my eyes are closed

Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Mama and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again, but anyway
I get fronted some ki's to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Mama a Benz and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
Just remember who changed your mind
'Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine
Indeed, agreed, proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want more
'Cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really though (Check it out)

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izzel, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
'Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas 'cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war
Pops off, 'cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Mama, I'ma ride for you, Baby Boo

Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me

Lodi dodi, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're just some niggas who're on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic (Right)
For all my dogs keepin' y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when you cause the cozy condition
In which we create  'cause that's our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around ten o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawn, and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands upon a cup
And said, "Um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top dog of them all?"
There was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, "You are, you conceited bastard"
Well, that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks with my all-blue Chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, "Oh no"
I went back in, "I forgot my Indo"
Then I dilly (Dally) I ran through a (Alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said, "What's wrong?" 'cause she looked upset
She said, um

It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much, you'll never know
'Cause you took your dope away from me

Damn, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feelin' blue
I said, "Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys"
Her mean mother step, then says to me, "Hi"
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Somethin' was wrong, I said, "What was goin' on?"
I tried to break it up, I said, "Stop it, just leave her"
She said, "If I can't smoke none, she can't either"
She grabbed me closely by my socks
And so I broke the hell out and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started cryin' on my shoes and grabbin' my dick
And sayin', "Why don't you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay"
And on and on and on, she kept goin'
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said, "Cheer up," so I gave her a hit
I said, "You can't have me, I'm too young for you, bitch"
She said, "No, you're not," then she starts cryin'
I says, "I'm nineteen," she says, "Stop lyin'"
I says, "I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover"

Yeah, uh, tick-tock, you don't stop

[Song 8: Did Somebody Say]
19 ContributorsDid Somebody Say Lyrics
(Did somebody say) Sick of this
Get those Just Eat foods online for me
(Just Eat) We gon' do this Doggy style
Did somebody say Just Eat?

Me, get delivery like a G
See hungry Dogg's gotta eat
I get mine every day, every week
Chicken wings to the crib I'm sittin' in
Burger in the low-low
Hope they kept the pickle in
Wonton on a catamaran
Oodles of noodles, thank you, my man
Tacos to the chateau, please
Did somebody say Just Eat?
Private jet in the night sky
My man hand glide by with my fried rice, right
What could you not love
'Bout a slice on the side of the hot tub? (Ooh)
What you gonna do, boo?
Chocolate fondue right on cue
Even dipping in the sea
I see food, seafood sees me
J-U-S-T  E-A-T
Did somebody say Just Eat?

Man, don't you know that I'm loco?
Mhm, hm

I was chillin' (Chillin') right around my way (Way)
21st, east side of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin' shit with his homies like he was a straight G
Askin' where I'm from while he runnin' up
Gangbang my set on e'ry one of 'em (20's, nigga, 20's)
Some things, sons, they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin' but the gangbang (Bang)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin' like a marathon
Lil' G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talkin' 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (Mm)
But they don't know once they get close
It's tic-tac-toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (Watch out)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray, I heard a ese say, he said

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now there's three motherfuckers dead and I ain't seen shit
But these niggas'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case, really, you could see
I crack the MAC back and pop off rollin'
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin'
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were broads
Believin' all the things that you never saw
In it, y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my dope? What the fuck? No
See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed, all you hear my enemies goin'

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in they mouth, goddamn
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat (Heat)
You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be "Beast of the East", motherfucker
I never hesitate to blaze (Blaze)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, 'cause my peoples
Is screamin' that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Ba-ba-bang on a song, make it feel like a drive-by (Drive-by)
It's a shame, but somebody gotta die (Die)
They see it happen state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin' L.A., all I hear the eses say, they go

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard

Don't fool with the player with the cool whip
Yeah, yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit
Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, let me put you in the mood, and
Little cutie, looking like a student
Long hair with your big fat booty
Back in the days, you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her off with some pimp-pimp fluid
Mommy, don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch Clueless
I laugh at these niggas when they ask, "Who do this?"
But everybody know, ooh, girl, that you is

Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it
Homeboy, she taken, just move it
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it
We just blow dro and keep the flow movin'
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin'
Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydraulics squeakin' when we screwin'
Now she's yellin', hollerin' out "Snoop!" and
Hootin', hollerin'; hollerin', hootin'
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'
Hair long, thin, black and curly like you're Cuban
Keep groovin', that's what we doin'
And we gon' be together until your moms move in

You got my pictures on the wall in your room, and
Girls be complaining you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone
(Yeah, oh, yeah, there's something about you)
You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you, and
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue, and
(Yeah, oh, yeah, there's something about you)
On the Eastside, that's the crew I choose
Nothing I do is new to you
I smack up the world if they rude to you
'Cause baby girl, you're so beautiful

That was Tha Dogg Pound here right on WBallz
187.4 on your FM dial
You're tuned in to the biggest balls of them all, DJ Sal T. Nuts
Ayy, don't forget about my homeboy Eazy Dick and The Jackoff Hour
That's happening at twelve o'clock tonight
Right now we got some new Snoop Doggy Dogg for that ass
This one is called "Tha Shiznit"
You're about to go downtown, bitch
Right here on the station that plays only platinum hits
That's 187.4 on your FM dial
If you're lickin', that's WBallz
Everybody's got to hear the shit
On WBallz, WBallz, WBallz
Poppin', stoppin', hoppin' like a rabbit
When I take the Nina Ross, ya know I gots to have it
I lay back in the cut, retain myself
Think about the shit and I think it well
How can I makes my grip?
And how should I make that nigga straight slip?
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner, now I'm on a
'Nother mission, wishin' upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo, no demo, this is the real
Breakin' niggas down like Evander Holyfield, chill
'Til the next episode
I make money and I really don't love hoes
Tell you the truth, I swoop in the coupe
I used to sell loop, I used to shoot hoops
But now I make hits every single day
With that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre
So lay back in the cut, motherfucker, 'fore you get shot
It's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop

Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da

Boy, it's gettin' hot, yes, indeed it is
Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I'm 'bout as crazy as Biz
Markie, spark the chronic bud real quick
And let me get into some fly gangster shit
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut
Niggas try to play the D-O-G like a mutt
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop
I'm finna fuck a bitch, what's her name? It's Luke
You tried to see me on the TV, you'se a B.G
D-O-double-G, yes, I'm a OG
You can't see my homie Dr. Dre
So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say?
Gotta take a trip to the M-I-A
And serve your ass with the motherfuckin' AK
You can't see the D-O-double-G 'cause that be me
I'm servin' 'em, swervin' in the coupe
The Lexus flexes from Long Beach to Texas
Sexiest hoes, they wanna get with this
'Cause Snoop Dogg is the shit, biatch

Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da

Uh, I'm somewhat brain boggled
So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble
Grab it, habit, stick it to the plug
It's Snoop Doggy, I got a fat dub
Sack of the chronic in my back pocket low
Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday
With the P-O-U-N-D and my nigga, Dr. Dre
Lay back in the cut like I told your ass
Give me the microphone and let me hit you with a blast
I got a little cousin by the name of Daz
And bitches who fuck him give me the ass
'Cause they know about the shit that we be goin' through
And they know about the shit that I be puttin' up
And they be knowin' 'bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic
'Cause Snoop Dogg is Trump tight like a virgin, the surgeon
Is Dr. Drizzay, so lizzay and plizzay
With D-O-double-Gizzay the fly human being, seein'
No, I'm not European, bein' all I can
When I put the motherfuckin' mic in my hand, and
You don't understand what I'm kickin'
'Cause Snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me
Listen to me, 'cause I do you like you wanna be done
Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three, two, one, um
Dum, diddy-dum, here I come
With the gat and the guitar will strum, um
Not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was
When I caught you slippin', I'ma catch you then I'll peel your cap
Snap back, relax
Ya bet' not be slippin' with them Ds on that '83 Cadillac
So we gon' smoke an ounce to this
Gs up, hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da

[Song 12: Doggy Dogg World]
97 ContributorsDoggy Dogg World LyricsA play on the figure of speech: “It’s a dog-eat-dog world”, characterizing life as a ruthless competition.
The song samples “If It Ain’t One Thing, It’s Another”, by Richard ‘Dimples’ Fields.
Can we get a motherfuckin' moment of silence
For the small chronic break?
A-hah, yeah
Niggas be brown-nosin' these hoes and shit
Takin' bitches out to eat, and spendin' money on these hoes
Know what I'm sayin'?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up — I never have, I never will
I tell a bitch like this:
"Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without Blue Notes
You'll never go platinum"
Hey Daz, give me a light, nigga
We’d like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker, and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggas know who I am, y'all niggas tearin' up shit
But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight
Put yo' hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics

It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' motherfuckers tryna steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, 'cause, see, my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'

You know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
Usin' my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt, seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, paddywhack, I still got the biggest sack
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (Why?)
Hit 'em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for the break up, so take off your clothes
And quit tryna spit at my motherfuckin' hoes
Speakin' of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize (Uh-huh)
And see where I'm comin' from — it's still Eastside 'til I die
Why ask why?
As the world keeps spinnin' to the D-O-double G, Y

It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World
(It's a Doggy Dogg World)
Oh

Well, if you give me ten bitches, then I'll fuck all ten
See my homie Snoop Dogg sippin' juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip to get papers
Styles vary, packin' flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that somethin'? Talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm comin' through
One-two, three — you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, usin' hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm comin' from L.A, she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that ho
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I’m dishin' out blues, I’m upsettin' like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Rough and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin' hoes in '94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it’s on
I’m head huntin', hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' TEC-9’s for some action
You really don’t know, do you? You fuckin' wit a hog
You can’t do me, I’m goin' out looney like O-Dog

Ooh (Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, ma-ma, my)
It's a Doggy Dogg World (It's your world)
The Dogg's World (It's your world)

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (All night long)
Uh-huh, 'til when? (Till the early morn')
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit for the
Tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dope shit

Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hoes with the fat dick
'Til I die, I'm still screamin' out ("Bitches ain't shit")
Now, I'm the mack daddy, had he
Not known about the city where I'm from, dum-diddy-dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D, the gangster clique
Now as Tha Pound break it down with the gangster funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
So I blaze up the chronic so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic 'til the day that I die

It's a Doggy Dogg World
A dogs world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
A dogs world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
A dogs world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
A dogs world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
A dogs world
It's a Doggy Dogg World

Thank you, uh, uh

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (Hey) your boy Kells (Hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi' you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me hip you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"

Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

Dippin' low, '64, hundred spokes and chronic smoke
All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees

You ain't tryna hot box with me, I swig hard liquor
Goin' down by the second round, all hail the underground
How that sound? Xzibit backin' down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense! Terrorist, here to bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin'
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that?
For me? It's blasphemy
You fuckin' around with the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk drivin', tryna stack my loot
While other rappers gettin' Treated Like a Prostitute, so check the SoundScan

All I wanna be was a G, ha
My whole life, nigga please, ha
Breakin' off these motherfuckin' keys, ha
Let's get these motherfuckin' G's, ha
Nigga, you don't wanna fuck with this

Oh, no, Big Snoop Dogg
Back up in the heezy, baby
You jockin' my style? You so crazy
Dre say, ain't no limit to this

Look here, bitch, you fine and I dig your style
Come fuck with a nigga and do it doggy style
I'll be gentle, sentimental
Shit, we fucked in the rental

Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago

(Yeah, nigga, you know what's happenin', man) I get this pussy everywhere that I go
(These bitches know what time it is) Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know (Hell yeah)
(Hoes know about a nigga like me, man) I get this pussy everywhere that I go
(I pimp these hoes, nigga, ha-ha) Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know

Bitch, please! Get down on your goddamn knees
For this money, chronic, clothes and weed (Look)
Look, you fuckin' with some real O.G.'s, bitch please
Bitch, please!
Get down on your motherfuckin' knees
We came to get the motherfuckin' cheese
Yeah, you fuckin' wit' some real O.G.’s, you dick tease

Bitch, please!
Now what you need to do is
Hem my coat, and roll me some dope (Fo' real)
Different strokes (Huh-uh) for different folks
Oh, you like settin' niggas up and gettin' them locs?
A cute little bitch with a whole lotta heart
Shit gets thick when the light gets dark
She say she got a lick for me (Well, hook it up)
Worth about 200 G's and 30 ki's!
Now check this out, Dre: now, if I don't move
Then a nigga like me, shit, I don't lose
But you know me, dog, I'm movin'!
Ain't nothing’ to it but to get to groovin'
You've been waitin' on a nigga like me (What's that?)
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance
That's the Devil, they always wanna dance
See we go out with a bang (Bang, bang)
I'm tryin' to work this cold thang
And take this whole thang

I get the money everywhere that I go (I go)
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho’ (Fo' sho’)
I get the money everywhere that I go (I go)
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho’ (Fo' sho’)

Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claimin’ D.P.G. till the day I d-i-e
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claimin’ D.P.G. till the day I d-i-e
Ayo, ayo, ayo

Still claimin’ D.P.G. till the day I d-i-e
Ayo, ayo, ayo

Six million ways to die, choose one

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt
Death becomes all niggas, anybody killer
You know what the deal is, nigga, you know what the real is

I see some off-brand niggas on the corner flaggin' me down
Sayin', "Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga Snoop alright? Ayo, what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?"
I said, "If you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the gang"
It's like this, they don't understand
It's an everyday thang to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up with you? I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
Or Compton and Watts see D-O-Gs, now
You can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang, one gun
Is all that we need to put you to rest
(Pump-pump) Put two slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping
Six feet deep in, fucking with the Pound is

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide

The cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, ooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon
'Cause I drops bombs like Platoon (Ayy, nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you (I won't leave you)
Until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, 'cause you don't wanna be caught
Half-stepping with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself, motherfucker, 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the Devil
Now roam through the depths of Hell
Where the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin' name?
Serial killa
Serial killa
Serial killa
Wake up in the morning, eat your Lucky Charms cereal

Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta
Now picture this
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine to crack your fuckin' chest plate
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally roughneck
Now everybody scream, 'nuff respect to the X
'Nuff respect given
Disrespect and you will not be living
Word to mama and my drama, dilemma

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin' name?
Serial killa
Serial killa

Wake up in the morning, eat your Lucky Charms cereal

How many hoes in your motherfuckin group
Wanna take a ride in my 7-8 Coupe, DeVille?
Chill, as I take you on a trip
Where them niggas ride, and slide, you know about the East Side

With my hoes on my side, and my strap on my back
Papers I stack daily
And Death Row is still the label that pays me
But you know how that go
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your ho, really though, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin' grip, and don't really give a shit

And I'm still gon' fade 'em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin'
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin'?
Every single one, to get the job done
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin' and I be rhymin'

I'm rollin' with the G Funk, bumpin' in my shit and it don't quit
So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin' dick
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin' blunt in your pocket, loc
'Cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See, it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin' East Side
So bow down to the bow wow, 'cause bow wow
Yippie yo, you can't see my flow
My shit is dope, original, now you know
And can't no hood fuck with Death Rizzow

[Song 17: Smokin’ On]
48 ContributorsSmokin’ On LyricsThis song is basically having Wiz, Snoop, and Juicy bragging up them smoking the best strand of cali weed which is OG
Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
'Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though

Cut those cameras on 'cause my camo's on
And my niggas back and we riding 'round town
With a big ol' bag of weed, Taylor Gang, we ain't in yo' faculty
Me and Snoop Dogg, we created a masterpiece
Smoke all day and I'm making this cash
And we 'bout it, 'bout it, like Master P
Go hard, stack ya cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees
T-G-O-D, he's the O-G, real G shit what it has to be
My real niggas gon' pop tags for me
Fake niggas won't get bags from me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now I'm riding 'round town in a car that you can't even pronounce
And you can't go fast as me
Smoking marijuana and she know that I'm a player
So she wanna come up here and spend that cash with me
That pimp shit come naturally
That fuck shit is whack to me
My kush grown organically
My balling is actually

Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
'Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though, fa sho
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on

Let me turn you on and turn you out
To make you feel like you really wanna feel
For real, show Will, nigga, I got that kilo
You know what I got:
Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo grow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I don't know
This is that shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock - oh no!
Cuttin' it up, button it up
Homie don't speak at all
You might 'scape, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga, you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight: let me break it down for you
Flip it, zip it, let it fly
If it's good, it's gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain't the one
We don't even smoke that shit for fun!

Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
'Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though, fa sho
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on

Yeah, nigga, I'm rollin' up that high-grade
Chilling on the porch, smoking like it's Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy J's a high day
Niggas think I'm Chinese 'cause my eyes straight
I pour up a 6 into a 20 ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like 20 ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I'm high as fuck
Every chick I'm seeing Juicy screamin' out: 'let's fuck!"
I done popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitches
They keep my double cup full, OG in my Swisher

Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
'Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though, fa sho
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on

[Song 18: Talent Show]
14 ContributorsTalent Show Lyrics
I've been trying to develop an alternative fuel from a mix of all natural substances
But the mix was highly volatile until we found a catalyst
To help stabilize the compound and supercharge the fuel
I'm sorry, what was this magical catalyst?
Marijuana, motherfucker!
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, players and playettes, teachers, staff, and students
I am very honored to welcome you to the high school annual talent show
Brought to you by the makers of Wiz Khalifa premium rolling papers
And the qualified growers of Snoop Dogg master Kush
So without further a due let's get this show on the road
First contestant bring your talent to the foreground and let your smoke be the background

Everytime I go out, I'm blowing that smoke out
I buy it, don't even know the price
I talk cause I live it, come pay me a visit
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's about to go down
We fly, it's no lie, that we high, 'til we die
All we need up in heres hoes now
Roll one up, clean the ride (Uh), case them hoes wanna jump inside

Got a joint filled with quality shit
My bottom bitch smoking with me, niggas talk shit
All of 'em shrimp (Haha), I'm a big fish
Roll a joint, lick it once, tell you hit this
Groupies on my dick, several kushes on my hit-list
In and out these niggas bitches
Smoking tree and not to mention hustling, trying to mind my business
You probably went to class while I was in the hallway skipping
Yeah I hear what they saying, just be to high to listen
'Bout my money, tripping if I even fold it wrong
You ain't smoking this good, if it's fire, tell you I sold it all
Or wait 'til one of my hoes come 'round to roll it all
Or say fuck it and cuff it 'til I go smoke with Dogg
I show off, I show out, I show off
Car push to start, hit the button once it go off
Keep the money coming in and the papers rolled up
And ain't worried about a hating nigga, they get no love

Everytime I go out (Out, out, out), I'm blowing that smoke out
I buy it, don't even know the price
I talk cause I live it, come pay me a visit
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's about to go down
We fly, it's no lie, that we high, 'til we die
All we need up in heres hoes now
Roll one up, clean the ride, case them hoes wanna jump inside

I go green like I was Arch Bishop Don Juan
And blow circles around you suckas like a marathon
My gym teacher told me but I didn't listen
My bitch did my homework and now I'm in detention
It should be suspension, this is my audition
So play your position, get the picture I envision
Did she mention; Snoop Dogg was made for kissing
A barracuda fishing, she on a mission for me
Pleasure, pain, and glory in my inventory
My SATs my little bitch she did 'em for me
And now we prancing on stage at the talent show
We flossing, my clothes, my chain, and my knapsack
Full of that, hand me that, can you see my telescope
Principal say she want to see me cause she smell my smoke
'Bout my money, tripping even if I fold it wrong
Blowing zones with Wiz because this is the protocol

Everytime I go out, I'm blowing that smoke out
I buy it, don't even know the price
I talk cause I live it, come pay me a visit
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's about to go down
We fly, it's no lie, that we high, 'til we die
All we need up in heres hoes now
Roll one up, clean the ride, case them hoes wanna jump inside

39 ContributorsOG LyricsWiz+Spitta+Snoop= Smoking music.
From the “Mac and Devin Go to High School” soundtrack.
Hahaha

Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go
Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go

Young nigga that's more famous than these older niggas
Young nigga got my game up from these older niggas
Motherfuckas hear my name, I say I told you nigga
I was taught to count my paper 'fore I fold it nigga
Now look at my chains, all them things frozen nigga
Rolling up my Mary Jane before I smoke it wit ya
Hit this J, I bet this be a day you don't remember
Looking at the top and I don't see not one contender
Cooking out the pot, I like my weed for lunch and dinner
Got some cookies in the jar, OG in the blender
You paying for quantity, but quality is what you spend for
If there's a marijuana-ology, I'll be your mentor
And all the bombest chronic leaf is what you in for
So give your parents my apology for me again or
Get high like we Cheech and Chong
We gon' eat some brownies, we gon' smoke, we gon' need some bongs
Roll up so we can all-

Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go
Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go

Killer Cali is what we blow, OG nigga from way down low
Known for banging the blue C rag, started off smoking nothing but Zags
Popping P's, chopping trees, 501's, Wallabees
All y'all invited, ignite it, light it, now follow me
Laid out, plush couch, flat screen television
Table full of vegetation, so you just might smell a nigga
That's what it is, that's what it's gon' be, East Side Long Beach where I'm from
Bring your girls, all y'all come, give me some, now give her some
It's big Mac, I love to have fun, you are, you are the one
If you get her to do it, then it'll be just like two on one
Break it down, lay it down, baby, work that body like
At the pad, acting bad, baby, what that party like?
Moving so schizophrenic, baby pull down your panties
Let the Doggy Dogg ram it, I cram to understand it
Back room that's my bedroom, make a right up in it
Close the door slow, oh fasho, I'm 'bout to slide up in it
Smoke somethin'

Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go
Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go

Having money and blowing hella chronic
Smoke I'm stunting
Cutlass on them chrome spokes with the engine running
Sounding like a dinosaur, empty stomach rumbling
Yo' bitch at the window cause she know I'm coming
She tell you that she 'bout to go jogging and on the corner she jump in
Take her to the honeycomb, stuffing kush in Raw cones, playing Megaman 3
Your Wonderwoman giving dome out Miami
Said she never leave me 'lone, she wan' have a family
She just high, tomorrow night, she'll be titties out, dancing
Tryna leave with the next nigga in the Aston
So why get caught up, I'm too swift up on my toes
To have my name brought up in sewing circles with them hoes
I rather be a straight G rolling up a whole
O-Z of that OG have them KO'ed

Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go
Have a little party at my crib
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go

Taught me how to blow O's, inhale through my nose
So if you see me smokin dont blow my high

You smell it all in my clothes

Blowin with the homies on the low, man fuck these hoes
And crack-a-lac, pin it back

Uh-oh, there she go
That's that look all on her face
Shorty dancin’ like she knows
She's the baddest in the place, hey, hey
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey)
So what you wanna do?
Got her freakum dress on
Them New Bs on her feet
And them bottles with the sparkles
So the other girls can see that she's paid
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey!)
So what you wanna do?

She too fly for words
And where I'm at now, I'm too high for birds
Shorty, what you think about my return
'Cause what he think about, it ain't my concern
I ain't come for you, I came for your missus
I don't do it for the haters, I do it for the players
Well, okay, I do it for the riches
But in the meantime and in-between time
Shorty right there gon' get it if she with it
If she ain't, then I know her partner down
‘Cause her partner throwin’ shots every time I turn around
And her partner bringin’ partners every time I come to town
I'm a G6er, a Maybacher
You can tell the chauffeur he can park it right thurr
And I'ma walk up to the club upstairs
And when I come down he can bring it back; word

She 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn, her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches and cream
Uh-oh, there she go
That's that look all on her face
Shorty dancin’ like she knows
She's the baddest in the place, hey, hey
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey)
So what you wanna do?
Got her freakum dress on
Them New Bs on her feet
And them bottles with the sparkles
So the other girls can see that she's paid
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey!)
So what you wanna do?

I came to cut right now
Bigg Snoop Dogg and I came to get down
Yes, I'm internationally known
Libra lovin' make you moan and groan
Burn my gas like race cars
Two bad broads with the bass on
I never met a girl that I'd wait for
I seal my deal like Jay does
All that and then some
Pimp real for real when I win some
I remember what you're thinkin’
Black shades on, drinking while you're blinkin’
Something fly, white limousine
Make a clean getaway
I loved your clothes, what you about
The way you let it out

She 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn, her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches and cream
Uh-oh, there she go
That's that look all on her face
Shorty dancin’ like she knows
She's the baddest in the place, hey, hey
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey)
So what you wanna do?
Got her freakum dress on
Them New Bs on her feet
And them bottles with the sparkles
So the other girls can see that she's paid
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey)
So what you wanna do?

Everybody in the world, here we go
Fill your body with the smoke, and that's the way to go

She 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn, her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches and cream
Uh-oh, there she go
That's that look all on her face
Shorty dancin’ like she knows
She's the baddest in the place, hey, hey
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey)
So what you wanna do?
Got her freakum dress

Yo what's Crip-a-latin'? This big Snoop Dogg
Leave your name and your number at the motherfucking beep
If this one of my hoes, 2-way me
Ayy, ayy, Snoop, what up? This your nigga Dre
Ayy, man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit 'til the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive 'cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the LBC
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin' shit
Best move 'cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (You little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Lugers, the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with?
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hold they stare and act hard
That's even though your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

What's up, pimpin'? It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it realer, 'cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me 'cause I'm a million-dollar hitta
It's, No Limit 'til I D-I-E
CP3 or Richmond, Cali's where I be

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

She's lookin' in my eyes, and I see no other guys
Are you tellin' me this is a sign? Uncle Charlie (Oh)
Don't think about it, boy, leave her alone (Ooh wee)
Nigga, you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
You ain't no G

It's legit, you know it's a hit
When The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit
You know he's in tune with the season
Come here baby, tell me why you leavin'?
Tell me if it's weed that you need
If you wanna breathe, I got the best weed minus seeds
Ain't nobody trippin', VIP they can't get in
If somethin' go wrong then you know we get to Crippin'

I'm not sure of what I see
Cupid, don't fuck with me

(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G

Now you stepping with a G, from Los Angeles
Where the helicopters got cameras
Just to get a glimpse of our Chucks
And our Khakis and our bouncin' cars
You with your friend, right? (Yeah)
She ain't tryna bring over no men, right? (No)
Shit, she ain't gotta be in the distance
She could get high all in an instant

I'm not sure of what I see
Cupid, don't fuck with me
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
She's lookin' in my eyes, and I see no other guys
Are you tellin' me this is a sign? (Oh-oh-ooh)

Nigga, you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G

Mami, Mamacita, have you ever flown on G5's
From London to Ibiza? You gotta have cake to
You'll have Sundays with chiquitas
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena
And I can take you

(Uncle Charlie, preach)
Nigga, don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doin'
You don't know what you lost until she's gone (Til she's gone)
She got a pretty face, drove you wild
But you ain't have that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style

I'm not sure of what I see
Cupid, don't fuck with me
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
She's lookin' in my eyes, and I see no other guys
Are you tellin' me this is a sign? (Oh)

For the dog that don't pee on trees is a bitch
So says Snoop Dogg
So get your pooper scooper 'cause the nigga's talkin' shit
Roof! Roof! Roof! Roof! Roof!

I'm sippin' on Tanqueray
With my mind on my money and my mouth fulla' gan-jay
R-A-G to the motherfuckin' E
Back with my nigga S-N-double-O-P
Yeah, and ya don't stop
Rage in effect, I just begun to rock
I said, yeah, and ya don't quit
Hey-yo, Rage, would you please drop some gangsta shit?
I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs
Handcuffed as I bust, 'bout to tear shit up
Oh, what? Did ya think I, didn't ever think I
Would be the one to make you blink eye, I'm catchy like pink-eye
Never will there ever be another like me, um
You can play the left 'cause it ain't no right in me
Out the picture, out the frame, out the box I knock 'em all
Smack 'em out the park, like "A Friendly Game of Baseball"
Grand slam, yes, I am
Kickin' up dust and I don't give a goddamn
'Cause I'm that lyrical murderer pleading guilty
You know from my skills I'm about to be
Filthy, large, Rage in charge
You know what's happenin', don't try to play Raj
This ain't no re-run, see, hun, don't you wanna be one?
However, Rage'll wreck ya 'cause I'm def
I kick my vocals, I loc yo, coast to coast or local, uh!
I'll make 'em go coo-coo for my Cocoa
Puffin' stuff, ayo, Snoop, you're up
Let these niggas know that niggas don't give a fuck

This is just a small introduction to the G-funk era
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And I see motherfuckers tryna be like me
Ever since I put it down with the D-R-E

Foamin' at the mouth and waggin' his tail
Searchin through the yard with a keen sense of smell
Lookin' for the bitches in heat
And when he find it he'll be sniffin her seat
We travel in packs and we do it from the back
How else can you get to the booty?
We do it doggystyle
All the while we do it doggystyle
Yo motherfuckin' hoe!
He fucked the fleas off the bitch, he shaked the ticks off his dick
And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin' bone
And if there's any left over, he'll roll over and take a doggy bag home

Damn, that Tanqueray is talkin' to a nigga
I ain't bullshittin', one of y'all niggas gotta get it
Man, I got to piss
Breath test?

[Song 26: Thug Life]
4 ContributorsThug Life Lyrics
Why is there suddenly a nigga trippin' when I do it?
Why do everybody else gon' have a war, have beef
Within the music, talkin' about differences and it's ok
It's music it's hip-hop it's groundbreaking
When I do it, it's war

In the city watch how I'm getting head with it
She do it with no hands and I be ghost whippin'
Oops I think I meant ghost riding
When I get that vet watch how she let me slide in
In that pussy and you know I'm the livest
Introduced known to beat it up no crime man
And I might leave your bae crying
I'm so stressed out man all the homies fall in
And if she let me hit, the homies all can
And nigga if I'm eating it's all in one pan
'Cause I'mma be as hungry as the last man
A young  but I'm the nigga with the damn plan
I keep it G like a crip in the '80s
And man I beat your ass like a nigga in slavery
They say they're trying to help me but it sound like hate to me
A young nigga, but I'm wise like Dr. King
On my own shit, get your own ends
Niggas think they gettin' handouts 'cause we damn friends
Nigga put that spoon down better use your hands
Better get that grind right before you life ends
And I ain't never had no love for a fake friend
Or a fuck nigga, better duck nigga
Better hope one of them things don't get stuck in ya
(Bbbbla) good luck nigga

Slip this with the crip stick
Itty bitty nigga with the slick shit
In a room full of misfits
Plug it in, let it bang, yea my shit bitch
Get bread like bisquick
You're a soft ass nigga with a face full of lipstick
Let me show you how a crip dip
Get ships and flips and take low trips
I sipps that shit ain't talking 'bout lean
Down to Mississippi and New Orleans
Word as a motherfucka, let me verb that
Snoop Dogg is a hog, yea I heard that
You deserve that swerve that 'lac
Make it bang, let it go, bring that back
I blew they brain, nephew yea do that thang

Living life in the maze it's amazing
So high I can levitate it's crazy
I feel like I'm the nigga in the matrix
I'm sipping codeine I feel like I'mma patient
I stay dosed down off a medical blunt this ain't new
Cop a qp I blow it with lil Snoop
Blowing smoke out the roof, hoes know we the truth
Get the bitch loose than I make her do what it do
Put the hole on the crew, word to 
I'm chopping real game, other niggas is goose
And when I pass by the bitch she gon' know we the truth
 gang green and we're devoted to you
We brought base in your face to proof
The realest nigga out bitch give me the juice
They never hate a nigga when he spittin' the truth
I gotta keep it real gotta stick to my roots

Tu-Tune in, you know my slang
Me and my niggas doing our thing and we all gon' win
Fucking these models and fucking they friends
Got more hoes than Snoop and Prince
Pimpin' nigga, look at my hands
Gold rings on my fingers
Young nigga and I'm hella dangerous
Like a lethal injection, ballers on it
Yea that's me section, getting money
Yea that's the only objection
Chrome everywhere so I see my reflections
West West, hold it down for Texas
Yellow diamonds on my necklace
Pretty bitches getting naked
Young nigga living reckless
Like 21 guns for protection

Been done with that fast life
So it was on to the thug life
Ain't no bet, but I could never love my wife
Like I love my life I never love ya twice
I fell in love one night still lost in the days in a major way
I be blazed for days, like Johnny
Mobbing in the  lane, it's my hobby
We savvy, real nigga say savvy
Looking for them bitches take them at a track meet
Deep dig bandit she run into my canyon
Dabbin' blowing like a candle, savvy
Woodgrain whippin' in the valley
Real OG I'm nothing like my daddy
Few kids on the way I'm happy
Raw dog, and I'm learning with a passion
Ohh, didn't y'all go to school
I'm reachin' and preachin' and teachin' the youth
They all in my business I'm feeling like Snoop
But I'm more like Pac learn a life lesson but I might get shot
I'm spreading the message that's all that I got
We pray for progression and stick to the plot
I'm feeling like Yoda my knowledge is hot

I see myself changing the world
Because my thought patterns are so opposite of the norm
So I will have to change the world
Or I will have to be changed by the world

We go walking in a winter wonderland

Yeah
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen, Blitzen, all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
While we stroll along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Will pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say "Are you married?", we'll say "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire (Here comes Santa Claus)
As we dream by the fire (Here comes Santa Claus)
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman (Bells are ringing, children singing)
Will pretend that he is Parson Brown (All is merry and bright)
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman (Hang your stockings and say your prayers)
Until the other kiddies knock him down (Cause Santa Claus comes tonight)

When it snows, ain't it thrilling (Here comes Santa Claus)
Though your nose gets a chilling (Here comes Santa Claus)
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way (Here comes Santa Claus)
Walking in a winter wonderland (Santa Claus comes tonight)
When it snows, ain't it thrilling (Here comes Santa Claus)
Though your nose gets a chilling (Here comes Santa Claus)
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Once upon a time in the LBC
Santa came up missing, he was sitting by a tree
His reindeers was near but their leader wouldn't lead
So I took the lead, now as we proceed
This ain't for no mistletoe, but you need to listen, yo
Just in case you didn't know, I call this my Christmas flow
I can take you higher and higher, chestnuts roast on an open fire
Gone away, think that's what the—, what the song say

Gone away is the bluebird (Here comes Santa Claus)
Here to stay is a new bird (Here comes Santa Claus)
He sings a love song as we go along (Here comes Santa Claus)
Walking in a winter wonderland (Santa Claus comes tonight)
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight (Here comes Santa Claus)
Walking in a winter wonderland (Santa Claus comes tonight)
Walking in a winter wonderland (Santa Claus comes tonight)
Ho, ho, ho

Word to my granny and my daddy and my mother
Whether standin' on the corner or bouncin' in the six-deuce
When I was locked up, I couldn't wait to get loose
'Cause back in the days, on the side where it's at
A nigga had to have a fat stack
And I was a fool
Don't make me have to grab my strap and go rat-tat-tat-tat

Any battle I'm in, I win, I can't be beat
Don't sleep while I creep, peep out my technique
I forgot, I'm out of sight, so you can't see the
MC of the year, you hear and you fear
I got somethin' for them niggas in the front and the rear
I handle the sides, did a drive-by in the hoo-ride
I'm satisfied, now everything is really alright
You know when I come, nigga, I come wicked
Don't need no permission, motherfucker, I'ma kick it
Niggas sweat my shit, I wet 'em up with the biscuit
Lick 'em up shot, it don't stop 'til dem all drop
Make up your mind, go pop or slang rocks
Just stop ridin' on the next nigga's jock
I'm strapped with my Glock on your block
And ready to let loose on the first imitator that I spot

[Song 29: Imagine]
43 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeImagine LyricsSince 1992, Snoop and Dre have been rapping about hardcore, gangsta hip-hop. In this song, they reflect over things and imagine if what happened in hip-hop, didn’t happen.
Yo, Doc, what up, my nigga?
Snoop Dogg, this is what it is, mane
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta, man
I think it's time for me and you to just tone it down a bit
Come on

Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin'
Imagine niggas trapped imagining having action
Imagine how these niggas could be actin' if we never got this shit crackin'
Imagine life so hard
You can't imagine, it's like livin' in the City of God, you feel me?
Imagine life on the yard
Or tryna get that dollar on some shitty-ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' called "Pop" by one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son, hm
Imagine life where you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto, and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen, you go right to the gin
So if you get back to the streets, you go right back in, hm
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam, just another nigga hustlin'
And ain't no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas, just tryna keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggas just stuck
From the East to the West Coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination to know niggas been blessed with hip-hop

Before we go, can you imagine?
With your ears, clear your mind, can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky, can you imagine? (Oh, hee)
Lord have mercy, I've been dreamin' all my life

Can you imagine being lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jail
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo'
Remember how they asked you "What you run for?", and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
Reactin' like they hate to see you gung-ho
But just imagine if the rabbit got the gun though, but you already know
Imagine niggas in the LBC
Felt just like Snoop Dogg and D-R-E
And felt just like them niggas in the 2-1-3
Then imagine that's what's coming when you fuckin' with me
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean, imagine we said "Fuck this shit"
Imagine if my niggas got together and tore up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growing up in jail dumb
Happy just to be alive, watching all your people run
Would you imagine growing up to sell you
Fifty-million records worldwide or fuckin' off somebody's son?
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets, would niggas kill each other?
All a drunk fool get is pissed-on balls
Keep fuckin' off my niggas, they gon' murder us all
Imagine that

Before we go, can you imagine?
With your ears, clear your mind, can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky, can you imagine? (Oh, hee)
Lord have mercy, I've been dreamin' all my life, all my life
Before we go, can you imagine?
With your ears, clear your mind, can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky, can you imagine? (Oh, hee)
Lord have mercy, I've been dreamin' all my life, all my life

Imagine, imagine
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, ow
Can you imagine? Uh
Can you imagine? Hm, ah
Can you imagine?
Imagine, imagine, yeah, ooh

"In the name of Allah, in the name of God
The beneficent, the merciful
The one God to whom all praise is due
Regardless of land, labor, or title
No matter what name you call God by
Whenever life seems hard
Everybody know that you must﻿ talk to God"

One, two, oh what shall I do?
I'm slipping on my khaki suit (Which one?)
The blue one, gun by my side as I mob to the beach
On a mission and I'm fishing for my DJ Warren G
Now as I look for the bud sack
And see where my loves at on the lake where the doves at
Cognac is the drink that's drank by G's
Sagging like a mothafucka, khakis to they knees
Bitch please, you know how we do the undercover
I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg, not your average motherfucka, see

Some of you don't know about the G thang, baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be driving ya crazy
Now as ya groove to the beat and ya move to the sound
I'mma hit ya up with the Pound, G's up, hoes down

Will all the real G's, please stand up
And let all be accounted for
And if you don't give a fuck about a bitch
Then you're rolling with the Row

Back with the one, two, three, and to the fo'
It's the S-N, O and to the O, P
(Why am I so fly?) I don't know, but
(Why am I so high?) It's the Indo

I don't fuck with the pocus, everbody knows this
Fucking with The Chronic cause The Chronic gives me dopeness
Now focus your eyes on these, follow me
As I take ya rolling with the real OG's
East Side is the motherfuckin' place, known as home
Doggy Dogg with my bone in my hand, twenty grand and

Niggas always handcuffing that ho
When a nigga like me steps in the place

I'm caught up with my greens
Collard greens, Indo and the cash flow
You know what I'm saying? Peace, G's up, hoes down

Come, let me show you the ropes
Chucks come with the LOCs
Drums come with the dope
Guns come with the smoke, bang
I just want the paper
I just want the paper
Gun smoke, Gun smoke

They say he a big stepper
I'm just sayin' I am not the type to get stepped on
I ain't got a big weapon
Glock 17 with the switch, but the clip long
I ain't finna play wit' you
Boy, you fuck around, I'ma have to catch a fade wit' you
Get the blick in broad day wit' you
Have the lil' homies run down while bae wit' you (Gunsmoke, gunsmoke)
Littlе man, dope party
Got him out the night, but the nigga got four bodiеs
Who want smoke? Nobody
Goin' once, goin' twice, don't want to smoke nobody
Tell me what you know 'bout it
Strapped right now, nigga, how you want go 'bout it?
I'm not the one you lean on
The type you wanna try apply pressure to and scheme on
Pussy nigga, dream on
Run, nigga, run 'til I have to click the beam on
Red dot ya, I got ya, B.I.G. time (Woo), who shot ya?
I dropped ya, who popped ya? Shit lit
Soon as I spot ya, ooh-wee
Why would you be fuckin' with me? (Gun smoke, gun smoke)

Let's take a second here for this moment of violence
You smell it in the air, product of my environment
I come from freestylin' over gunshots and sirens
Nothing more gangster than my voice over these violins
Get down, lay down, it's the wolf of the Dogg Pound, yeah
Playground, shakedown, Autobahn, no brakes now
Skinny nigga back pushin' weight now
New Death Row on the plate now
More details, please do tell
What's that smell, nigga? (Gun smoke, Gun smoke)
Shit, you would too, if you knew
What a young nigga had to do
Rendezvous with a Pac or two
Rock shit up like Mötley Crüe
In this fight, you gotta stick and move
All my life, I had to show and prove
Still a nigga with a attitude
If you ain't gangster, this is not for you
Yeah, bullet holes in the palm trees (Palm trees)
Dirty money in the laundry (Laundry)
Ten toes in the concrete (Concrete)
Niggas know where to find me (Find)
I got a long reach, this Long Beach, where we don't speak
And you saw what happened to the last nigga
That tried to fuck with my proceeds (Gun smoke)

I remember when I was thirteen
Searchin' for how to get my revenge on the world that hurt me
Thirsty for commas, them double entendres
Turned me to an entrepreneur and a monster
Constantly caught in some kind of controversy (Gun smoke, Gun smoke)
That was my mantra, to taunt ya was kinda condescending
But why should I be kind to the kind of people that weren't kind to me
Comin' up? So like that syrup they canceled
I'ma say, "Fuck you and your mama," then blame my rap persona (Gun smoke, Gun smoke)
That's the excuse that I used to explain my grammar
Allowing me to just do what I do and not face the ramifications
So I could air my frustrations
But I'll be damned if the same reporter's gonna shove another tape recorder
And camera in my face while I am at the Burger King
Just to grab my lil' baby daughter a hamburger like Shady oughta be amicable
Guess that's the price that you pay for all the glamour, the fame and stardom
Like when you're treated just like an animal (Gun smoke, Gun smoke)
You'll not act like one when you came from bottom
But they gonna make me wanna pull a llama
And make like I'm a mechanical bull (Yeah)
Fuck around and buck these hoes, ain't talkin' no luxury clothes
Two nines I tuck, see those?
Like Rock & Roll Hall of Famers, try and duck deez, yo
Hey, what the fuck you want?
Didn't I just see you yesterday?
Fuck outta here, fuckin' bitch
Now I'm much older, and I may be calmer
Run up on me, and I might be a little less likely
To go crazy on ya, and let the

Gun smoke
I just want the paper
I just want the paper

W-Balls, it's your main man DJ E-Z Dick
About to unleash another one of those platinum plus hits
And the word is on the streets, and the word is the streets
And we gon' go to a live remote and check in with my main man, Mr. Doggy Dogg

A day in the life, of a Rollin' 20 Crip
I'm just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
Now just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the Loc'ness (Uh-huh)
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick off in this funky-ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah, Dogg ain't diss y'all
I got a couple Relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs
Like K-Dub, Top Kat, B-Real, E-Rock, Bool-Aid, Face
And the homie Heron, rest in peace
Big Jay from Campanella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big Neckbone
Mausberg, I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you bein' jealous of what I does
'Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast
In the paint playin' post - I back you down
Like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wilshire Boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't pull my hoe card (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I fucked all your groupies
When you was doing time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches (uh-huh), no killers just bitches
And you was payin' niggas off with all my riches
You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?
Oh, I know (Bitch!)
But I walk the mainline every time I go down
You can check my G Files, I do it L.B.C. style (Crip!)
I got the word on you, Simon
You need to just start rhymin'
'Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table
You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for "1-8-7 on a Cop"
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit
If you keep talkin shit, on Crip! (Crip!)

It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous how my paper stack (Jealous-ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous how my paper stack (Don't get pimp slapped)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous how my paper stack (Jealous-ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous how my paper stack (Don't get pimp slapped)
Money, get it
Paper, I got it
I got to do it (Get it, get it)
Heaters, I keep 'em
Bitches, I got 'em
Run up, ya get done up, I stay one up
Money, I get it
Paper, I got it (I got it)
Huh, I got to do it
Heaters, I keep 'em
Bitches, I got 'em
Run up, ya get done up, I stay one up

If I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous
And I'll be spending money out the anus
Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level
Man, you worse than them devils
A lotta niggas should've said it, fuck 'em
But I'ma say it for 'em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for 'em
This nigga's a bitch like his wife
Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life (Haha)
And I'ma let the whole world see
'Cause you fucked up the industry, and that's on me
We can go head up, nigga, set it up
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists, tell 'em, shut it up
'Cause I'll fuck every last one of 'em up, especially Kurupt (Shhhhhhh)
See that's my lil' homeboy, so he know what's up (What's up)
He better keep it Crippin', and slip his clip in
'Cause these niggas trippin', this is official business
Do the same way, leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected, misdirected
Sprayed, covered and protected
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it (Check-check-it)
It's all to the good again
You can catch Snoopy D.O. double in the hood again (Eastside Rollin'!)
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it (Feel it, feel it)
So put the bacon in the skillet (haha), and try to peel it
'Cause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga

It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous how my paper stack (Jealous-ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous how my paper stack (Don't get pimp slapped)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous how my paper stack (Jealous-ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous how my paper stack (Don't get pimp slapped)
Money, get it
Paper, I got it

Money, I get it
Paper, I got it
Jealous-ass nigga

You know, uhh, I got much love for you, boy
And like you said, man, expose that big old, fake-ass nigga Simon, man
That nigga ain't never been from the streets, man
I seen, I met that nigga in '90, man, that nigga popped up, I don't know where that nigga came from
But anyway, man, this Jim Bob from Campanella Park, homie
Uhh, Mausberg, uhh, big homeboy and Jay big brother
So, uhhh, you know I'll holla at you later out there on the streets, man
I see you man, keep your head up, boy
And niggas over there in the neighborhood got your back, dog
Alright
One love, big homie
Keep it straight

36 ContributorsBoss’ Life LyricsFourth single off Snoop’s “Tha Blue Carpet Treatment” album which features the late Nate Dogg. The album version of this song features Akon, who’s vocals were taken off the single version due to label issues.
Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's
And the G's puttin' work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really, a pocket full of women
Understanding how I'm living, show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'mma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin' pimpish
And it's comin' from the Beach where them niggas is a beast
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first nigga, the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish

See me man, I'm nothin' like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
I'm leanin' in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin'
Me, I'm ridin' by ya on the corner, block slangin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
The hoes come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money

This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Timbs and them niggas with the platinum mouths
Thinkin' that they blessed by the actions that be comin' out
When you in Magic City, you be carrying a lot of clout
But trickin' ain't the route, that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin' it when they can't do without it
Just put the P up in it, nigga, if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fuckin' with it for a dolla
If she a baller, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Boss Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin' out the Doggfather
'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin' diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
Walkin' on the blue carpet with the Doctor

See me man, I'm nothin' like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
I'm leanin' in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin'
Me, I'm ridin' by ya on the corner, block slangin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
The hoes come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money

75 ContributorsFor All My Niggaz & Bitches Lyrics
Well, it's that slow flow, D-O-double-G, nigga
See these other fools, but you can't see me, nigga
Who am I? (It's Kurupt, motherfucker)
Do or die (We gives a fuck, motherfucker)
So slow your roll, I'm in control like Janet
The loc-est twenty-one year old nigga that's on this planet
Take it for granted if ya wanna, 'cause I'm gonna
Grab my strap then clear the corner, bitch

To all my bitches and my niggas, and my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin' fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches, and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin' hands in the air

Now, on a one (One), two (Two), three (Three), who could it be?
Comin' with a grip of gangsta shit for '93
So '94's arrived, nigga, back on up
And let me and my dog Kurupt fuck shit up
Now can't nobody see me here or there, wherever I bails
I put it down all around, 'cause ain't shit for sale
In the coupe with the beat, flossin' off gold Ds
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much for Tha Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for gettin' us all fucked up, now check it
It's a fallout for niggas like those
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin' like hoes
Yes, y'all, walk the dogs, yes, y'all, yiggy-y'all
Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball

I packs a strap like that, I kicks it like this
Now, how many bitches must get dicked?
Before they say, "Oh, that is that nigga from back in the day
I never, ever thought I'd see him bustin' with Dr. Dre"
'Cause I grips mics, I rips mics in half
Hoes be comin' to my flat so I can tap that ass, to all

To all my niggas and my bitches, and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin' fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches, and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin' fingers in the air
You're headed my way, nigga, you best to hit a U-turn quick
So what's happenin'? I'm cappin' shit up like a Western flick
The kingpin of the clique, top notch
Seventeen-shot Glock cocked, so all niggas drop
The run of the mill fool get broke off for tryin' to serve the best
Kurupt's era, peep the terror, 'cause it's a murder fest
I smoke chronic every day, so what have we?
Another motherfucker gettin' served like some cavi
Now who drops (Rough rhymes)
I got the Juice like 2Pac (Plus I'm), rollin' with two Glocks
Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt
Hell-raisin' like Pinhead, beware, I'm tearin' shit the fuck up
Slow your roll like your legs was broken
Who's jokin'? Rakim never joked, so why should I, loc?
And that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow, though
Runnin' 'em like Flo-Jo, stranded on Death Row
Mediocre motherfuckers die 'cause I'm servin'
And they can't fuck with or see me, I'm mass-murderous
Smokin' indo, look out my window I suppose (Yeah)
Niggas don't understand how we kicks different flows
I'm raw like news footage, I'm rugged like a BF Goodrich
Bring your whole set and get your hood lynched
Drop to your knees like a dog in heat
Peep the murderous styles and the poetical techniques

To all my niggas and my bitches, and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your motherfuckin' fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin' fingers in the air

Check it out, it's Rage, ready for the breakdown, take down
When it comes to the mic, I'm puttin' my weight down
And that's a hundred seventy-five pounds of beef
Beatin' your ass down to the concrete
Fool, act like ya know
I'm stranded on Death Row with nowhere to go
So, what's a girl to do?
Take out a crew or two, a few, what you wanna do?

Throw your guns in the motherfuckin' air
We don't care (Niggas don't give a fuck, nigga)
About nothin' at all
Just my Doggs and clockin' a grip', bitch (Niggas don't give a fuck, nigga)
That's why I can kick it so tuff
'Cause when times get ruff, my (Niggas don't give a fuck, nigga)
The clique that I'm with don't give a shit
You know why? (Real niggas don't give a fuck)

Now all the bitches and the niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air

It don't really matter though
You remind me of the time when I had a ho

With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips
You so right I'm gon' beat
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say shh"
See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, woah
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, woah, woah

Sensual seduction
All the time, anytime

[Song 38: That Good]
31 ContributorsThat Good LyricsSnoop Dogg & Wiz Khalifa: something old, something new…but both are madd faded
Roll up and light one with Snoop, Wiz, and the RG editors while you listen to this joint
I’m smoking everywhere I go
No stick, no seeds, just Al Green
I always gotta keep one rolled
I keep that, need that, got that
I’m rolling every gram I own
That purp, that bomb, that kush
Don’t gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that

Concentrated, everyday I’m faded
Trees prepared and properly cultivated
I nursed ‘em, sprayed down, no chemicals
Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now
Never treat ya wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We up in smoke, making street schemes
Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams
Break it down, put it in the Z-I zag
And pull the top back and let the ass drag
Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
Executive branch, get a whiff of this
Black card, sack of dank
High School nigga what the fuck you think?
I’m passing all my classes with flying colors
And everyday I’m high as a muthafucker

I’m smoking everywhere I go
No stick, no seeds, just Al Green
I always gotta keep one rolled
I keep that, need that, got that
I’m rolling every gram I own
That purp, that bomb, that kush
Don’t gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that

Sun roof open, smoking while I’m rolling
My bitches only notice it if it's potent
Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs
Joint roaches and ashes all in your bed
You calling her babe, she calling me instead
Cause I put that game all in her head
She saw the crib, she know that I’m balling
When he ain't have nothing he used to stall 'em
Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him
And my pockets on swole, I’m talking Rick Ross big
And now when we shop we don’t care what the cost is
Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit
Blow a whole OZ, nigga thats boss shit
Now she all fuck her man, rubberbands in my pocket
Getting money, going hard for my profit
Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
Young nigga out here getting bread, why knock it

I’m smoking everywhere I go
No stick, no seeds, just Al Green
I always gotta keep one rolled
I keep that, need that, got that
I’m rolling every gram I own
That purp, that bomb, that kush
Don’t gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that

We welcome you to High School
We do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
We welcome you to highschool
We do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
Get high to it

And every real B-Dogg, to the table right now
Yeah, we gon' push a real line right now
See if y'all with this real gangsta guerrilla shit

Have you ever seen 100,000 rip riders from the side
Blue Chuck's, blue rags, grey clouds, blue skies
On the move, can't lose, Hill Street blues
Niggas gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray
These suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news
She shook up, look up and then she put me on the move
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park
And I got into a squab, got caught and went to jail
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail
4800 with this Crippin', oh well
My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail
He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right
Eyes open cause niggas get stuck on seez-ight
It ain't no motherfuckin' problem - pop-pop, tick-tock
Never flip-flop, 20 crippin' til I drop

Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip

Is I, in the motherfuckin' S-5
With the red bandana double knotted 'round the rearview
Niggas see clear through, they know that it's Game
Cherry red Lowenhart's let 'em know that I bang
So bang, like Snoop in "Deep Cover"
I got the seat reclined, fo-five under the white-T, smothered
Dippin' down Green Leaf, I ain't got no enemies
Been shot five times, now I bleed Hennessy
And bang for my niggas locked up, they can't stop us
It ain't a gangsta party 'til we go and dig Pac up
I'm Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on
Hughey P. Newton with Air Force One's on
I gangbang but I'm the opposite of Tookie Williams
Red Lambo', red bandana print ceilin'
Me and Snoop got the West Coast locked
Red and blue rag tied in a knot
With all my motherfuckin' homies yellin' out

Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip

I ran outta gas in Long Beach, I'm stuck
Ain't no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck's
Hopped out the '6-trey, nowhere to go
Til' Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steeler '6-4
We just dippin', one Bloodin' one Crippin'
I'm on that Bulls shit, throwback Scott' Pippen
Moral is, my bandana hangin' from the left side
So if you ain't a Crip or a Blood, just throw up Westside

(What up Blood?) Yeah cuz, we just tippin'
Me and Game doin' thangs, switchin' lanes, Hurricanes on my feet
Stop, and C-Walk to the beat
Game, take the wheel and turn on 21st Street
Eastside LBC, gun in my hand
It's the turf by the surf but we don't play in the sand
We just - slip and slide out, we rip and ride out
Let it C known, nigga welcome to the Thunderdome

Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip

Is what they say as if they knew me
Groupies, on my head like a cufi
My nigga Kid Cudi, that's my little buddy
Call some hoes up, and get some cutty cutty
What's your life like? Mine's is kinda tight
A long way from hustlin', that china white
My people love me, the fans love me, I'm all go
If you ain't showin' love, then what you call for?
I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price
So alike and in need of my wife
Smoke 'til I'm gone, Dogg on the throne
I'm world-wide known, I'm a boss in the zone
I get it how I get it 'cause I can, I earn my spot
You see the plan, I'm just fuckin' with my fans
I turned out to be the better man, important to life
You understand while I'm puffin' on this gram

Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them ho's, don't love them ho's
The code in which y'all roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I can't forget that tree

Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah nah nah

I got my fam dawg, look at my niggas
Got a little money y'all, and I ain't trippin'
Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated
Steady wantin' freaky hoes, then I want a lady
Holdin' the fam down, and my close homie
The peoples who were there, when some sucka left me lonely
Phony, when you see a nigga don't approach me
Made it to the top baby, that's on me
Koch tryna claim that they made me
However you feel, another real fugazzi
I keep it one hundred, never frontin', don't need be
I'm in another zone, no place you could see, my nigga
Conyo to haters that don't know
Low pro, how a nigga like from costo
The one fans love, who was always approachable, yo
And I rep the double O, smokin', eatin' Cheerios

Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them ho's, don't love them ho's
The code in which y'all roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I can't forget that tree

I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah

Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king
And I'm still on the scene, you gotta love it
All out in public, the people want to touch it
I need a blunt with the stuffin'
Nigga, it's nothin' for me to chill out, post up at the house
With Madden on the screen, and smash on the homies
Hollywood nice now, everybody on me
And on the blogs talk shit like they know me, hm
Aww fool, take you niggas to school
"How to get rich and stay cool"
Snoopy D O Dub, show you homie, even with the critics
And the Feds all on me, I was tappin' all the chonies

Boss dogg, nigga sue me
Pony tail swangin' as I lay in the jacuzzi
Love of my life, while I'm puffin' on the oww wee, kush

Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them ho's, don't love them ho's
The code in which y'all roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I can't forget that tree

Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah

Nah nah nah, nah nah nah

[Song 47: The One And Only]
20 ContributorsThe One And Only Lyrics
Aw yeah, coming to you live and direct from the LBC
We have the one and only, Snoop D-O double G
Yeah, yeah, drop it
(*scratching*)
It's the one and only D-O double G
Big Snoop Dogg, it's the one and only
The one and only, D-O double-double-double G

Big Snoop Dogg
You in the presence of a motherfucking rap star
I push up laid back in a black car
Though I bossed up, it ain't hard to tell that
I came up hard as hell, check it out
I stayed sharp and played my part
All I had was a mic, a dream and some heart
Me and my moms wasn't getting along at this time
And since pops was gone, I'm out grinding
Catch a nigga praying, swearing I ain't going back to jail
Judge about tired of a playa, I don't know about this bidness shit
But I'm good with this rapping, can I get a witness what's happening
That's about the time I put down the rocks
And got to working in the studio around the clock
For a small profit, but a whole lot of game
Man I'm famous, now it ain't the same

It's the one and only D-O double G
Do you want some of this
Top Dogg bite em all, yeah I'm burning it up
Aw naw, Big Snoop Dogg
You tuned in to the number one
Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck four
So get real fool, fool

Local boy made good over night shit
Not only am I getting righteous but wise see
I paid the price, with consecutive platinum hits
I up my status, ain't no more Calvin Broadus
World on my shoulder, but I can handle it
Now that I'm older, I'm sharper and colder
Can you remember when I slid in Deep Cover
And made niggas in the Beach love eachother
A street hustler, but I'm all set for the come up
Best kept secret so I'm want up
I've been acquitted up for 1-8-7
Yes I'm blessed thank God in Heaven
Now all I need is a push in the right direction
Weed and a mic now I'm writing checks
And now the game ain't stopping
And can't nobody say my name ain't popping
Started off young as a little-bitty buck
Now I'm ready for the world, and I got to give it up


You in the presence of a motherfucking millionaire
Stop, look, listen, feel, yeah I ain't tripping on shit
I worked hard as a motherfucker
Fuck Cuzz, and him too cause all y'all suckas
Now with the savvy of a business man
I gave, new niggas a chance, to see what they was saying
And kept a spot on hot, West Coast on lock
Big Dizzel knocking down your block
Never looking back uh uh, a steady process
And leaving that way, cause see I'm blessed
It's like I'm happy now, cause I'm a family man
I fell in love with my kids and my wife again
And these here are the files of a classic
It's my throne till I choose to pass it
Worldwide and the sun shine so bright
That's why I wear my L-O-C's at night nigga

She on the hip like a Sidekick

I whispered in her ear, "C'mere, you're ready to go?"
I rolled up a winna and put it up in the air
Got that lil' dress on, you comin up outta there, yeah!

You say you bite, well I bite back

'Cause I'm a gangsta, I grab her by the butt (oh)
Pull her to my side, I'm in deep
Woke that ass up, just to put her to sleep
Everyday, it's the same thang, I creep in

When I'm tearin' that ass up, workin you like a shift

You hear what that boy say?
You gettin jacked, give it up fast
Then I hit it from the back

Especially when I'm in it

Fuck (fuck, fuck)
You know a nigga really don't wanna go to school today
Lemme call this bitch
Get my shit together

When I pull up we look so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

This one's for the g's all black Chucks on the cuffs of my jeans
King size papes stuffed full of trees, I be with the boss dogg ya'll fuck niggas fleas
Now they say I'm hot, hundred somethin' degrees
Taking pictures with a young nigga cheese
Remember days homey, I ain't had a thing
Now I'm hoping off the plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
Jewelry froze like bling
Money come fast, yours slow like (lean)
Rolling up grass, sold weed to half the staff, so I know I'm gonna pass
Third period, showing up last
With a late note blowin' great smoke (laughs)

When I pull up we look so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

We blow to the middle of the day
Wiz say dawg put a little in a J
Hey, why not? Not why?
We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
Fuck it, everybody to the libary
Got a new batch, some blue - booberry
Stuck in the hallway, with a pass say dawg he just smoke all day
It's a mind game like Kareem I seem to keep migraines
Reaching balance and bitch I brang you limeaid
I'm so lifted, like a parachuter
My grass stay off day off Ferris Bueller
Slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a whole zip away
But fuck that, this Taylor Gang, what you want dog
Shit I'm on everythang

When I pull up we look so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

You niggas never had and you never will

You niggas never had and you never will

We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can

Keep moving on

Don't bother asking me to ever give my lady up
Was about five years old taking my first puff
It was love at first light, fell in love the first night
My uncle told me, “Don't rush, this could be your first crush”
Now I'm on the block with all the homies and it's a family affair
Seventeen with a dream, blowing smoke in the air
Serving fiends, my routine is where I was that year
Avoiding them fucking pandas in my rearview mirror
County blues, wanna lose shit, I'm with all of my peers
Looking back, I wouldn't change shit, oh what a career
I used to flip bags with her, skip class with her
She comfortable as fuck when I'm trying to smash with her
She got a lot of fans and thеy always harassing us
Ashes to ash to dust, feels like I'm Lazarus
I can't get past thе rush, never pass her up
Who took this bitch worldwide? Nigga, we gassing up, now is the

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
Even before the fame, she was my novacane, you know it ain't 'gon change, 'cause now
I feel summer creeping in and I'm tired of this town again
And yet, the truth remains that it just ain't the same without my Lois Lane by my side

I've seen some things in my life, it feels like raging inside
This time I'm changing my mind, I'm saying goodbye to the dangerous side
Sometimes you gotta roll with it, fighting fire is a damn cold finesse
Somehow she came in my life between the white lines and made it alright (Well alright)
And everything she ever told me
Knew it from the get go, yes I did (Oh, yes I did)
And if I gotta grab a can of gasoline
Strike a match, I'ma burn that bridge
It's so unfair what she did to me
The way she sparked this epiphany
I tried to walk away but I'm stumbling, whole world crumbling
Somethings never change, but now it's my

Last dance with Mary Jane (This is my last dance), one more time to kill the pain
Even before the fame, she was my novacane, you know it ain't 'gon change, 'cause now
I feel summer creeping in (I feel it coming) and I'm tired of this town again
And yet, the truth remains that it just ain't the same without my Lois Lane by my side

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Rolling up another pound every time you look up
Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now I'm doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing
Don't stop!

Tae Bo, five, four, three, two, one
Working out, chiefing up, creeping up, keeping up
With the Joneses, smoke a zone with my pen pals
In my neighborhood, flavor's good, roll up, put some papers to it
Straight into it, gon' make him do it, that thing can do it fo sho
Get my lift on, while get my spliff on, fo sho
Break bad, stay cool, way cool, roll a doob
Old school, paid my dues, spray these fools, ladies drool
Cause they know what I got
I got a bag of the Saturday pot
And it'll keep you up from Thursday to Saturday night
What do you like?
When you smoke with the Dogg, you had the time of your life
Now light... the fatty, jump in my Cadi
Pull your seat back, yup, I know you need that
Let it flow, set it go, incredible
That ain't gold, laying low like 10 to 4, on the floor

My weed man got the hook up
Rolling up another pound every time you look up
Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now I'm doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing
Don't stop!

Don't even trip
Ain't really gotta use a scale, I could eyeball a zip
So much weight you thinkin', “Why this ain't for sale?”
Weed in my lungs, weed in my nails
She coning joints, I'm rolling weed up myself
Don't ever get my weed from off the shelf or my clothes
I heard Polillo 'bout to drop some shit, order those
Pounds, I got more of those, why my eyes sorta low
Not too many when I roll, more arms than  though
Boys hating, I'm just counting up the money I just made
And what I'm making make a nigga make a million dollars later
Smoking getting high pays
I like my eyes glazed
Ain't empty out my ashtray in days
At my house playing pool in some HUF socks and Joyrich sweats
I roll a joint, you roll another one next
Can't even name a nigga colder than
Ain't pay for game that mean you stole it then
Know it's the bomb when you hold it in

My weed man got the hook up
Rolling up another pound every time you look up
Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now I'm doin' kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing

Ten little Crip niggas runnin' outside
All from the turf and they bangin' out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggas a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season

The gangsta's back, the bank is fat
The gangsta MAC, in a gangsta 'llac
Hmm.. fools be like, "Break off some cheese"
Friends and enemies, aww nigga please
Fuck, you thought who pumped you up
Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked
It's all similar to gettin laid
On ya back when the motherfuckin' K sprays
I grind for my shine about my bidness
Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit (ignit)
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em
Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy
Seventeen years old and still a baby
Gangstas real, they pop the pill
You cap back, young motherfucker it's like that

Ten little Crip niggas runnin' outside
All from the turf and they bangin' out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggas a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season

Wake up in the morning lookin funny and shit
Fuck a honey dip.. cause I got money to get
Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this
Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this
Keep a strap in ya pocket when you trip through the towns
There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang
If ya money right then you might get you a chain
But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
So mean, so green, crip back to the block

Don't let this street life get ya down
Don't let this street life run you around

Since I was young I grew up in the street life
Times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
Ain't no tellin' what my life might be like
Growin' up in the street life
Since I was young I grew up in the street life
Times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
Ain't no tellin' what my life might be like
Growin' up in the street life

You can't tell me shit about them streets homie
I done seen it and done it, don' live the real from the phonies, out for the money
Homies maintain they composure, since kids we was only sellin' dope by the boulders
Now I'ma scold a motherfucker for the chips, when I dip to trip on G.P., straight for D.P., flip the script
Came up quick and got some riders who got my back
Snoop Corleone, I'm always down to jack
I jack for instant , talkin' walk the walk
Niggas who oppose automatically get stomped
Terrorizing the neighborhood niggas gainin', they grab me
 and Daz, mashin' for the set
Rest in peace to deceased homeboys who ain't alive
Street life took him over now he's forced to ride
Slippin' and slidin', bouncin' countin' my ends to be straight
Cause times is rough for these days niggas is crazy, but the fear is much greater, the innovator, dominator, soul creator, out for the papers!

Since I was young I grew up in the street life
Times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
See ain't no tellin' what my life might C like
As a gangsta growin' up in the street life
Since I was young I grew up in the street life
Times get hard for a nigga in the street life
See ain't no tellin' what my life might be like
As a nigga growin' up in the street life

Bustin' and bailin', thug, addicted to drug sellin ki's
Got me riskin', the street living, catching felonies
How many niggas wanna see me gone?
You playa haters is bitches who hate to see a nigga hold his own
Forever ballin', no never fallin'
Live my life as a thug nigga, now can you hear the liquor callin'?
When we blaze niggas is blinded
My competition, minimal so I live so, criminal minded, nigga
Can you hear me wave yo' pistols in the sky
Roll a fat-ass blunt and bump this shit, I bet it get you high
They wonder why I'm hard to kill, hard to let it go
How can I have fear, all my peers live on Death Row
Don Makaveli, 45, tucked next to my belly
Conversating with my nigga Dogg, lyrics so deadly
Wanna come and get me, bring an army
An Outlaw thug motherfucker, who can harm me, huh
Bomb these bitches, leave the track smokin'
Cause real Bad Boy killers leave the gat smokin', ha ha
Open ya eyes and understand this, murda ain't fair these motherfuckers doin' scandalous
Niggas don't wanna see me hot with my Glock cocked, drinkin on Henn', screamin' "fuck the world, this is the end in the street life"

Since I was young I grew up in the street life
Times get hard for a nigga in the street life
Ain't no tellin' what my life might C like
As a gangsta growin' up in the street life
Since I was young I grew up in the street life
Times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
See ain't no tellin' what my life might be like
As a gangsta growin' up in the street life
Ain't no tellin' what we all might be like
In the land of the lost (Yea) in the street life
Ain't no tellin' what we all might be like
In the land of the lost of the street life

Quick to keep back haters who don't know me

My gangstas understand me

Voila, taadow, check out this bizarre
The D-A-T the N-I double G, the D-A-Z
Again it's up in the wind, feel the breeze, for sheez

Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frost colors switches
Hit the gas, hit the brake, yeah, I really burn rubber
Dip, drop, drop, dip
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip!
Yeah, nigga, shot caller
It's America's number one baller
Man I don't give a fuck, like, "fuck it"
Hi, bye, slide in the bucket
Little mama all up on a nigga like a coat
I got the perfect thang that'll coat her throat (Candy!)

[Song 57: Santa Claus Goes Straight to the Ghetto]
33 ContributorsSanta Claus Goes Straight to the Ghetto LyricsSnoop gives us the update to James Brown’s “Santa Claus Go Straight To The Ghetto”
Is that the Black Santa Claus? (Ho ho ho ho)
I want a Super 'Intendo (Merry Christmas!), yeah
Sega Genesis (Mommy, mommy), yeah
Street Fighter 2 (Mommy, is that the Black Santa Claus?)
And a gang of toys (That is the Black Santa Claus!), uh
Mommy, mommy, mommy

It's 12:30 a.m., Christmas Eve
I'm out with the gangstas and thieves
Celebratin', postin' up with eggnog head up-up in my cup
Put Rudolph in motion, sleigh all bang-bangin' and coastin'
Down the block, but be careful for the hawk because it's posted
Some stay to this day that Christmas ain't nothing but another day
But, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day
Tell me, tell me, where do the homeless and bums got to sleep? (Nowhere)
Where do hungry and the needy-greedies got to eat? (But who cares?)
Life is so crucial and cold, as for, for the children
In this world they hopes and dreams can't unfold
The young and old churches, the spiritual dreams, seasonal things
Heard throughout the ghetto, reaches gangstas and dope fiends, huh
'Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it
'Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood, now we ballin'
Livin' to a new year of better thangs
Celebrate it with some Champagne, haha, check it (Yeah)

Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto

Now on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A sack of the Krazy Glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
Now on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A fifth of Henn-dawg and told me to take my mind off that weed
Now by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me
A whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nothin' but game to me

Back then, you woke up to the sound of "I Saw Mama Kissing Santa"
Made you reminisce on the old fashion Christmas days
Gifts, Mr. Fat Man jolly with joy
Down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys
Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in
And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall
Run to the window, put my eyes to the sky
To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
I sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine
My bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine 'til next year come
I try to see the same thing, they got us brainwashed dumb
And when you find it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot
'Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got
You got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people
Well-wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas

Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh, don't get too close because you might get shot)
Is coming straight to the ghetto (Welcome to the ghetto)

Santa Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin'
Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain
Season's greetings, all the proceedings
Are brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'
Chestnuts roastin' on a open fire
Singin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle?
I didn't pout and I ain't even shouted
I even stayed in the house when the homies tried to sneak me out
And all I want for Christmas is my six-four Chevrolet
And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly
Ain't that somethin'? (Uh-huh) Nah, ain't that nothin'
How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
Everybody happy (Happy), hair still nappy
Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
Catch me giving out turkeys at the church house
Don't try to work me, just stand in line and everything gon' be fine
Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound
And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs
Christmas on the Row, can you dig it? (Can you dig it?)

Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto

Christmas Eve, I believe '76 was the year
Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked
To be ate after everything gone off your plate
But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice
On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?
I wonder what the morn bringin' so it's hard to doze off
Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the door soft
Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa
Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana?
Messin' with the boxes that's up under the tree
Look like Santa Claus done crossed into a woman to me
Now I'm comin' to see the whole picture gettin' clearer
How we have less as X-Mas get nearer
Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've been deceived
And thank you, Saint Trick, for the gifts I received
So I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it
This'll be me and mom's private secret

Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto
Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto

We wish you a happy new year
We wish you a happy new year
We wish you a happy new year
We wish you a happy new year

Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto
Santa Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is coming straight to the ghetto

[Song 58: Stoner’s Anthem]
12 ContributorsStoner’s Anthem LyricsSnoop lights up a big one while recalling some interesting advice he once got from James Brown
A friend indeed
Feeling like Cee Lo Green
Middle finger in the sky
Meditate and let it ride
Rock-a-bye beddy-bye
A friend indeed
More than jimming to
More than giving you
No prohibits to
You can have a listen too
I couldn't find no one else that I could give it to
And now that we on
I could put my family in a brand new home
My kids is grown
And I'm still rocking on the microphone
People love me everywhere
And I know why
It's not that I'm dope and my style is so fly
James Brown sat me down in a chair
And said, "Snoopy, don't you ever cut your hair"
I was dazed and amazed
That's why I keep my shit in ponytails or either braids
When I was in school, I used to get cool grades
When I graduated, used to smoke two jays
With a fifth of Seagrams
Mixed with some sacco
Then I got a Caddy sack, just like them vatos
Posted up six-one, yeah, that's the block though
Ride by slow and get your ass popped, though
Me and Geeda, Faith and Terry, that's when rump was enough
Can't forget Tim, Baby Dog and Half-Dead
Dre-Loc was a 20 Crip that showed me a lot of shit
But moving along, I went from a Camaro to a Fleetwood Brougham
My sack in the back
My strap in my lap
Room to the back
Rolling through the neighborhood, checking my traps
As you get old, life like just might unfold
Can't settle, this might be untold
Twilight Zone, live life long
Smoke you a bone, and hit you a blunt
Buy you a zo', and roll you a jay
And put it in the E-I
And let's stay way fucked up til we D-I
All in together now if you agree
And lighters in the air, repeat after me
I’m too blowed, forever in a day
I love for oh's so
Cause everybody green ain't dro
Everybody can't smoke like we smoke
Give a dog a bone
I like trees that cypress hills grow
Roll up this shit, pimpin', it's on
Stoners worldwide singing this song

Last but not least, I wanna thank me
I wanna thank me for believing in me
I wanna thank me for doing all this hard work
I wanna thank me for having no days off
I wanna thank me for... for never quitting

And tryna give more than I receive
I wanna thank me for tryna do more right than wrong
I wanna thank me for just being me at all times
Snoop Dogg, you a bad motherfucker
(Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg)

Eagle side, homie coming up
I was young and I didn't give a fuck
Long Beach nigga, a fiend for the bucks
Lean in my chucks, banger, I'm tough
Yeah, long time coming, had to earn my G
Gold digging hoes had to learn my fee
I beat a couple cases, I'm H-O-T
I'm Snoop Dogg to the world, gotta thank 'ol me
We celebrating, you hating on a real one
All the L's that I took, man, I still won
Big bank rolls coming at ya
West Coast king, man, I need a statue

Yeah, I said it, who did it like me?
Who want the dice? Nigga, bet it
20 plus years, I ain't even gotta sell it
I ain't even got to show up to get the money
Mail it, I'm going in

Oh, I paid my dues and earned my stripes (Can you hear me?)
No matter what ya say it's all me (Can you hear me?)
Bring that beat back, bring that B-Cat

Who did it like the King? Go tell
Sent a bunch of kids to the NFL
Did it from the dirt, nigga, can't you tell?
Don't I ride by in that SSL?
Snoopy had to get it on, ball, beat ten of y'all
I'm just tryna show 'em how the men evolve
Couple mill', then they into y'all
Still screaming, rolling through my Hollywood stid-all (yeesh)
Back up off me, sip your coffee, it's the Dogg show
Smoking weed on TV like a Marlboro
Standing there flexing, hoes see the drip
This crip, no question

Who bigger than me? Shit, yeah, I said it
Who did it like me? Who want the dice? Nigga, bet it
20 plus years, I ain't even gotta sell it
I ain't even got to show up to get the money
Mail it, I'm going in

Battlecat, what you gon' do?
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Long Beach, East Side mad-ass lunatics
Still own niggas who talk bitch shit
Down for whatever, whoever wanna see me now
Slap a bitch nigga out to get a grip
Take a whole lot to be Snoop D-O-dub
You gotta put it down and always stay G'd up

Who did it like a muhfuckin' legend?
Yeah, it hurts, church, reverend
Sat back, took a look at me, shit's classic
Pocket full of paper, the haters, they can't grasp it
Still at the top of my game, I'm all-pro
Lost count of the cars, nigga, they all show
I got a family to feed, now that's growth
But I'll still lay your ass out for the low
Now, grown men make it hard to trip
I'm talking big dick shit, man, it's hard to grip
Got a whole gang of albums and some major flicks
I got a wife, rich life, that's some major shit

Bigg Dogg, yeah, I said it
Who did it like me? Who want the dice? Nigga, bet it
20 plus years, I ain't even gotta sell it
I ain't even got to show up to get the money
Mail it, I'm going in

Used to be out West, but now you hear me
From the LBC, around the room, let's blow this smoke
Used to be out West, but now you hear me
From the LBC, around the room, let's blow this smoke
La-da-da-da-dah
It's the Snoop to the D-O-double-G

Girl, as I sit here thinkin' to myself
There is no one for you but me and I mean that
And I think about all the things we been through
Like arguin' and fightin', for example
You know, the love we have for each other
It tends to outweigh what we do to one another
You know, my granddaddy used to always say
You know, he used to sing it like this

There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe

What up, motherfuckers? This is Snoop Dogg
I'm tryin' to figure out how the fuck I'ma do y'all
Hangin' with my homie from the turf, that's young Q-Ball
Givin' me the word on the streets, here's the scoop, y'all
The niggas from Tha Eastsidaz split up (Split up)
And one of 'em tried to fuck your shit up (What?)
Nah cuz, don't believe that, that's my nigga for life
I'm out with the bullshit, I'm in with the real shit
I'm at the church doing work, spittin' game from the pulpit
Now that's the business, and God as my witness
LBC, 213, hell yeah, we in this
It's so relentless and all my dogs up against the life sentence
I love y'all like I love no bitch and that's real shit
On some Crip shit, homie, dig this

There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe

I used to have a lot of broads that I don't fool with
I used to have a lot of homeboys I ain't cool with
A lot of people that a nigga went to school with
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin' it
But wouldn't none of them believe it though (What?)
That I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow
I guess he was right, these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches, I'm getting cake
To realize your fate through faith
'Cause we all gon' get that day (For what?)
To see if our life was straight
And see if we'll be able to walk through the pearly gates (Yeah?)
To see the man upstairs
On some real talk, homie, I'm tired of bein' stuck here
If I could, I would fly to the moon (Zoom)
Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off these mushrooms, I know

There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns

There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales are make-believe

He always would tell me, "Sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad
You got to do bad in order to do good"

But I'm still finna handle my business like a dog
Fading that pussy, yes y'all
So lay back baby girl, and take a trip with me
I got the drink on deck, so take a sip with me
Drip with me, while I swing my thang

It was a hot sunny day in the month of May
I'm next door to the house with my homie J
Instead of being at school, I'd rather ditch and shit
Cause at one-forty-five I got a bitch to get with
Even though I'm young, I'm kind of real good
With working my thang to get a bitch sprung
She glimpsing in the mirror and shit
'Cause once I'm in it from the back all I'm hearing and shit is

Once you get near, the pussy gets clearer
(I can see it)
I will do things to blow your socks off
(I can feel it)
Once you get near, the pussy gets clearer
(Doggystyle, Doggystyle)
I will do things to blow your socks off
(Yeah)

A little something for the bitches that's down with me
Keep it low as you creep and get around with me
Don't be afraid like Aaron Hall
You know you want to fuck your nigga Doggy Dogg
Have you ever had your pearl tongue licked and shit?
While your nigga's in the county and you eating a dick
The position I'm fishing and wishing for
Is doing it Doggystyle, bitches blow

Oh I, oh I (oh yeah), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh

My nizzle, what you sizzle?
Fo' schizzle, bizzle, ha ha

Me and my partner, in my Impala
Poppin' our collars, tossin' up dollars
A truck on the side of, with hoes that wanna follow
Bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna swallow
Doggy Doggfather
I do it to you real hard then it gets harder
It's nada – thang on mine, I bang on mine
I smoke an ounce and bounce at the same time
It's off the limbo, with Timbo, you motherfuckin' bimbo
So quit knockin' at my window, you nympho-maniac
Bring it back, now shake it up
Put it on the table, now break it up
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it
It really don't matter what you spent on it
As long as you're gettin' what you paid for
That's what it made for, ain't that what you stayed for?

Who that dippin' in the Cadillac? (Snoop Dogg)
Smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts (Snoop Dogg)
Who got a girl layin' on her back? (Snoop Dogg)
Who that makin' that paper stack? (Snoop Dogg)

You play me and I'll play you
You pay me and I'll pay you
Hold on, boo – you got the game all wrong
This ain't yo' thang, this my song
Move on, we in the club at the Shark Bar
Valeted my keys and park my car
No snap shots, 'cause I might get popped
As I slide by security, givin' 'em props (Whattup, whattup)
First thing I do, when I get in
Let me take you back, to when I first slid in
Grab my gin, get my pid-in
Put my bid in, no bullshittin' (no bullshittin')
We'll be sittin'–in the corner
With smoke comin' from up under us, like we sittin' in the sauna
Burnin' up the charts (Burnin' up the charts)
Break a bitch heart – lil' mama, don't you start

Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac? (Snoop Dogg)
Smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts (Snoop Dogg)
Who got a girl layin' on her back? (Snoop Dogg)
Who that makin' that paper stack? (Snoop Dogg)

Tick tock, the ice on my watch
Slap me 'cross the face around two o'clock
But the party don't stop 'til we blow up (Ka-boom!)
Now every lil' bitch wanna show up
Manuev'in' to this, groovin' to this
Dippin' to this, flippin' to this, trippin' to this
Ain't no skippin' to this, trust this
Bust this, it's too hot to touch this (Ahh!)
He say, she say, I say "no way"
Don't need foreplay – okay, obey
Everything that I say... (Uh)
And every day'll be like a holiday
I put you in the front seat of my car
And roll you 'round town like a superstar
Recline the seat and turn up the beat
Number one with a bullet, rollin' down the motherfuckin' backstreets

Who that dippin' in the Cadillac? (Snoop Dogg)
Smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts (Snoop Dogg)
Who got a girl layin' on her back? (Snoop Dogg)
Who that makin' that paper stack? (Snoop Dogg)

Can you be my doctor?
Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down?
So I can lick you up
Make you give it up, give it up
Til you say my name
Like a jersey, jersey
Shittin' down the game
Be my head coach
So you can put me in
And never take me off
Til you can taste the win
Do it again and again
Til you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad that you came

Tell me baby are you wet
I'm gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet wet

Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip

She's hot on a rainy day
Don't drown
Call me up
I can save you now
Lick your feet and kiss your mouth
Swisha sweet, I got you out
There's only one way we can stop the drought
Come with me take a trip down south
I can tell she's thirsty
I'm in the hole like a birdie
What you wanna do tonight
It's still early
Wanna get spewed tonight
She's all sturdy
I'm in between your lips
Like a cigarette
She wanna quit
But she wanna make it, make it, make it wet

I'm gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet

Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip

Can you, can you get me up?
Like I'm late for my first class
So I can give it to you rough
Like a first draft
Hold you like a paper plane
You know I got paper babe
But fuck them dollar bills
Girl make it rain
Holiday Inn, come
Meet me on the 8th floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for them maids though
And I, apologize
But when I slip inside I turn girls into slip n slide
It's a flood in your heart love
Girl let me pop up in your hot tub
Every night every day
Sippin' on a different drink
Different chicks different days
I do it different ways
Where you going
What'd you say
I want her river flowing to another lake
Another ocean another ocean
On the beach on the beach
I'm bout to take a swim
Let let me dip my feet and get wet

I wanna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet

Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami

C-Walk in the party, let the Crips up in it
To handle our business, baby, put your back up in it
C.B., O.T., yeah, we back up in it (Ooh-wee)

House party like a motherfucker, full of my folks
Hendog, O.E. and a couple of P's
Pile of seeds, weed, and a couple of G's
Ooh-wee, I got the mic, it's my turn
The roof is on fire, let that motherfucker burn

Well, alright, y'all
Talk that shit to me
Tell it like it T-I-is, my nigga
Talk that shit to me
Uh, talk to me, 'cause I'll talk back
It ain't my fault your girl fell in love with a gangsta mack
Now that's cold, jack
Talk that shit to me
Peter Piper picked a pimp to play the game with passion
Made power plays with paper while they folded like a pamphlet
Protectin' my progression, politickin' for the people
Platinum with Doggystyle, "Deep Cover" was the prequel
Polarizin', prophesizin', I'm what put us on the map
At Poly bustin' down them P-O-U-N-D's into them sacks
Poundin' pavement with the pushers, pocket rocket for the pussies
Player tried to play me cold, I left him bleedin' in the bushes
I'm like a pigeon with precision, Snoopy shittin' from the top
Piggly Wigglys on patrol, tryna pop us at the park
Partner, please, we just posted up, we plottin' on some paper, man
Just popped a Pontiac and peach is probably what I'll paint the thang
Papered up, I can't complain
Still, I play the game, but it won't ease the pain
My homies passin' earlier than they 'posed to
Pop 'pagne in the Porsche
Most powerful Crip to ever throw up gangs on a poster

Got to earn your stripes

Then you need to get a life (Talk that shit to me)

Crip without a crush, cocket full of cucks, check that
Cock it then I cuss, count one in the clutch, step back, swish
This Crippin' collision causing catastrophes
My casual conversations end up turnin' to casualties
Cold game, cat crackin' with Kokane
Go against the gang, we got a cellar with your name on it
Showstopper that dropped classics
The same nigga that closed curtains will close caskets
'Cause the crew on it too like compilation tracks
Runnin' numbers up, but it ain't no miscalculatin' that
Goin' kamikaze for me and my concentration camp
'Fore we had to take it back, 'cause really ain't no cake in that
Cryptolite
Play Superman, I'll be your Kryptonite
Took the nigga's citch 'cause she'd rather fuck a Crip tonight
Get this right, can't call yourself a king unless your clique is right
You niggas better get your Crippin' right

[Song 68: Who Got Some Gangsta Shit?]
31 ContributorsWho Got Some Gangsta Shit? Lyrics
Nine in the mornin', feds at my door (My door)
Blue Cortez squeakin' 'cross the hardwood floor (Right)
Dippin' through the alley I made my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape
Mad with no music but happy 'cause free
Bailin' fast as I can bail down 19th Street
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistol's close in hand
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC
Remotely controlled by the bomb E.T
But just livin' in Beach city is a serious task
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask

We're comin' with that G shit, that C shit that makin' niggas sick
How does it feel to see a G from your clique?
Wake up, jumped out of bed with my grin on (Why?)
Last night's dice game, got my win on
About a G and a half is what I came with
But twenty-five G's is what I left with
Tee-lee was the word I heard
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the curb
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas
I threw a six (C-I-X) so my point was the biggest
Seven, four, four, tre back to back
I sent two fools back to they 'Leezzac

See now I'm off to the graveyard shift
And I gotsta pay my dues to make my grip
But I chill 'cause my ho might call
Ain't no thang, 'cause I sleeps all day and slang when night fall
And I takes a quick walk up the block
With my Glock cocked, ready to make a stop where I set up shop
On Fifty-nina, 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin'
That's where a nigga'll be slangin'
I'm makin' a cool grip of shit, this ain't me
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki
And now the shop's on deck
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tec, I don't half step
Now I got ends
And I'm rollin' a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends
But I could only trust a few
And unawarely I trusted you
But if I only knew

G and Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin' get-go
Devoted and quotin', back in '84
I was thirteen, G was a year older
But I still wasn't afraid to throw 'em from the shoulders
Gettin' put on the hood was the anticipation
And yeah, King Park was the destination
Every nigga that I knew was at the park that night
Even the smokers that be lovin' to get sparked at night

Back on the streets, straight blue and gray
'Cause I represent like every day
Nigga, you can't tell me I don't be on the spot
When I can tell you all the homies that done got shot
From at least about five years ago
When I was in junior high goin' to Marshall
The homie use to come up to the school and rock
And leave and have the bitches flockin' his jock
Damn, them was the days of the past
But since the Pizzound formed, we been whippin' people's ass
And everybody'll blast
And if you don't believe me, nigga, you can ask the homie Daz
And that's your ass
Fucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (Haha)
He didn't even run, he walked away (Busta)
Cuz, I lived to see that day
I wished I was there, I woulda clowned
But that's why we "x"-ed your bitch ass from the Pound
'Cause he wouldn't even squab back
Man, we can't fuck with no niggas like that
He'll get us all cracked
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap
Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!)
I second the motion, you was dropped from the clique (Yeah, yeah)

Some of these nigga are bitches, too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you've ever been told on
Go out and get your roll on
You punk ass nigga, you gettin' stole on

It's 5:30 in the mornin', now I'm yizzawnin'
Now as I proceed to get G to a tee
And before I bail to school, you know I blaze up a sack
Another day to clock a dollar for the gangsta mack
Bitch, act like you know, show me some sex and affection
And lick me down slow
Flossin', tossin' a bitch (Bitch)
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten
Shoot the pink slip to your Benz
Seven, goddamn it, win again
A six and four for the hundred, straight four for a G
Young Daz, little nigga, you can't fuck with me

Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you
So what made them niggas try to spit at you?
Disrespect the game then snitch on you
Y'all punk ass niggas, man, y'all some bitches, too

Who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (Haha)
Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin' up on me
'Cause when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes
Just boulders, ounces, half ounces and quarter pieces
See, it's the season and I don't smoke bunk
It's either indo or skunk, I might as well get drunk
Than smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest
I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up
My hood is gettin' hot and niggas is tryna plot and
Come up off a young nigga callin' his shots
Swoop G ain't the one, I do what's to be done (Ah)
Always have my gun and my G from 2-1 (Ah, ah)
In Cerritos, but you don't hear me though
'Cause you don't really know about the you-know
On Cerritos, silly ho
Swoop G, motherfuckin' LBC
None of these nigga wanna fuck with me (Ah)
Swoop G (Ah, ah, ah)
G, G

But I'm from the hood, got a pocket full of stones
I used to cop "Rob Base", turn it into "EZ Rock"
Just to stay "Doug E. Fresh", all that shit to easy rock
Used to "Chef" Raekwon, give fiends a "Ghostface"
Y'all know my "Forte", I just might catch a dope case
I "Mastered" the "P"
With connects in the Midwest, so I'm "Heavy" in the "D"
Your boy still "Snoop" around
Since a pup, I been "Kurupt" and I fuck with Tha Dogg Pound
Ugh! Roc Nation is the gang now
Some dope lyrics is the only thing I slang now
I "Get the Job Done", I put the "Kane" down
It's no "Biggie" - heh, I'm just a king now

(*Malice N Wonderland!)

G Mix!!!! I was a fiend, before I became a teen
I melted cabbage sacks instead of cones of ice cream
Crime orientated that's how the west was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzle, complicated
I dropped the sack and tried to rap hits y'all
They tried to bang on me, and say that I'm too small
Cool!!! Cause I don't get upset
I call the king of the east catch a flight then I jet

Loadin ya gat, pop pop, I'm holdin ya back

It all goes back, to '85
When I start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yessir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-0-6
She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels
And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin, breakin bitches takin
Whatever we want, see she want with the fakin
It's real in the field, no mistakin
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up, listenin to "One Love"
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'mma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfuckin president y'all
He said, "Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
And make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?"
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
Major pimpin, out in D.C
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left
And you's a young ho with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a ho in check, blowin us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little ho I met
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
I shot it in her face and it went "Ahhh"
My homeboy Charles
Went up in his sister, behind the garage
I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in a ho
Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back
But for now let me holla back Impala black
She's a 12th grader, in my science class
And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm movin fast
See I was taught by, and I was taught I
Better move on somethin fast if I thought I
Could claim a dame, or game her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Now what you gon' do, when they ask you
Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G
Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?
Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose
It's a 90 percent chance she gon' get pimp juice
Now what it do, what it is
Now you livin with that ho and y'all got fo' kids

Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy

And where we come from, loc, that's the hood life
Where you mama and daddy
Throw the set up out the moon while they swangin' the caddy
That's on the set, tats on they neck
Streets sweet with the heat, yep, they stay on deck
I'm dazed and blazed, no confusin', I'm choosin'
This how I was raised
I bring that out and bag it up, no doubt
Swang it out and let it up and bang that out
This Crips, nigga

That's crazy, cuz
You know my whole life, I wanted to be a gangsta, mane
I used to see my OG home boys at King Park
Ridin' on bikes but they came with they flags on the end
C-walkin', Stacey Adams, 501's
That shit was fascinating

The Miles Davis of gangbangin' and crack slangin'
Drivin' a fresh rock, rental with blocks in 'em
I'm fresh out the county, I'm boxin' 'em
Moved on up and bought a continental, nigga, with knock in it
Now I'm rockin' it, '61 blockin' it
If y'all ridin' by, my nigga, we cockin' it
We poppin' on imposters, fake ass mobsters
East side niggas, no stoppin' us
My recipe is treachery
The best in me, nigga, the West to be
A better place for the one of Ace
Put a 9 millimeter in your fuckin' face
And let you say your grace before you have a taste
Of reality, set in, yeah, it's your fate
Now your homies at your funeral, plottin' on some get back
But you can't get back 'cause nigga, you dated
Another sad gangsta story
And usually ones with the territory
No nuts, no glory, no pain, no gain
Life for a nigga growin' up in the game
This slangin' thang, drinkin', sell a lil' cocaine
Get locked up for a minute now we in it to win it
Now everybody know me
They watchin' the makings of a real OG

Yeah, they say if you watch somethin' long enough, you'll become it
You know, they say imitation is the best form of flattery
That's what I was told
A lot of niggas is imitatin' this real gangsta shit
You ain't cut from it
You dig?

Yeah, scarin' all the white folk
While stayin' on the right note
And you can quote me if you want to
Don't say what you will do, nigga, what you gon' do?
I'm live in the flesh
Caught him on Imperial left five in his chest
Survive in the west
It's everyday cycle, you never know what might go blam
And how you like me now?
Crip 'til you slip, Mr. Big Bow Wow
Yeah, it's my chance to prance
I got ants in my pants and I needs to dance
I go for broke, no joke
I gotta put my drink down, I'm tryna C walk, loc
See i'ma take off, break off
And make off with the cash
At the pad with, a thick lil bitch, she super bad

Gangsta, gangsta
Futuristic
Snoop Dogg
48 hunnid
C's up, yeah
Shoot or shout out to my home boys
Harlem 30
Yeah, real shit
All my niggas on the East coast
6-0's, Eight Tray, Hoovers
Main Street, all my niggas in Compton
And the South side, ya dig?
Nutty Blocc
Santana
Oh, can't forget them Long Beach niggas
East side the same
Rollin 20 Crips
19th Street
West side, you know what's hatnin'
Saten Day, West Coast
North side on the block
All hood, yeah
Crip shit

Hah
How y'all feeling out there?
Yeah
Pop a little louder if you lovin' it
I'm fuckin' with it, turn my mic up
Yeah, yeah, that's it, hah
Return of the titans in this motherfucker
Lovin' how this is feelin'
Yeah, go 'head Erik, Sting 'em
Yeah, make some noise if you don't give a fuck
Yeah, I like that

Just another part of me
I'm just tryna show you some gangster love
Wearin' my heart on my sleeve (Yeah)
Out here livin' armed and dangerous
Now tell me, what do you want from me?
Here in the land of the lost and the scandalous
Bright lights, sunny days, cold nights
Ridе the wave, hold tight, just a day in Los Angelеs
Encore, I'm not done, he is I, one of one
From my hood, two-one, risky business, Top Gun
Dogg back out on a mornin' run, me and Dre, redrum
Make a cake with these breadcrumbs, on my mama, son of a gun
This for my people, I'm just handlin' procedure
Hear no, see no, speak no evil, vision like a Desert Eagle
Yeah, hood starrin' with war scars from breakin' laws and beatin' charges
Top of the charts, this shit is ours, Stacy Adams on a blue carpet
Standin' too close, you'll fuck around and catch a contact
Yeah-yeah, from the smell of this potpourri, ah
And it got you feelin' good, don't it?
Same nigga, same odor, this is an iconic moment

Money on my mind, oh, yeah-yeah
She about to come alive, oh, yeah-yeah
And it's right before your eyes, oh, yeah-yeah
Just a thief in the night (Ooh)

From the jump on the run, man, I walk away
I'm the one, give a fuck what they got to say
Mmm, gotta get up out of my way
Yeah, there's no better time than today

In a moment jump up on it, see the ocean, stay in motion
You're not broken, no, I'm chosen, I just gotta have faith
Time is passin', I stay active, mom is laughin', move is wrappin'
Millions stackin’, look what happened, life just isn't the same

From the jump on the run, man, I walk away
I'm the one, give a fuck what they got to say
Mmm, gotta get up out of my way
Yeah, there's no better time than today

Yeah, thank you
I really appreciate the love
Never have so many done so much for so few
Goodnight

Well how ya been where ya been and what it look like?
My game trump tight especially when it bump like
Four DPG's gettin' crazy
And No Limit is the label that pays me!
Ridin' 'round town layin' game down like Goldie
And I remember what my momma showed me, told me
Game recognize game and stay true to what ya do and don't be ashamed
I got all my game from her, sometimes I have to wonder
How I keep from goin' under I'm a cold muthafucka
I fall to my knees and thank God before I do my thang
I don't know why, I love to gangbang
See life ain't nuthin' but a twist anyway bitch anyway
You can say what you wanna say
Just don't get in my way cause I'm a mean old
Fiend know C know & P know see loc
We make music for the thugs and the bangers and the bitches
Fuck you R&B singers
She want a nigga with his khakis hangin' real low
In a black rag Sixty-four hmm
Rollin' down the street lookin' way clean
Bangin' that real shit nigga like Al Green
I'm headed straight to the LB (LBC)

Coldest entertainer gangbanger since Alphonse Capone
Count money like Basie, police try to chase me
Niggas try to replace me but you can't
I'm ridin' in a tank I'm blowin' hella dank
So whether ridin' in ya lo-lo or smokin' on some doe doe
Spread the word and take the fo' door
The Last Don done hooked up with the muthafuckin'
King of the coast with the most here's a toast
And Snoop Dogg is the representor

Well, um‚ I mean‚ you still got a good relationship with him today?
Me and Suge cool as a motherfucker
I'm cool with Suge‚ I'm cool with Master P, Dr. Dre, I'm cool with everybody
Yeah‚ I mean, how could you not be cool with Snoop?
But I had to go get that cool with him
I had to go sit down with Suge

On Crip, that was my nigga
18 years old‚ lost and locin'
Crack money had a nigga open
Hopin' that that rap shit wasn't just cap shit
G'd up, no Dre, okay that's cool
But that's old news to niggas like us
'Cause if so, he would've signed us off top
But bro stayed solid so I'ma stay solid to that
Studio every night to the early morn'
Bloods and Crips all moving on one accord, cuz did that
Took Death Row to the top, my buz did that
Caught that case, came out safe, Bloods did that (Suwoop)
So through the ups and the downs
Real ones know not to kick niggas when they down
Especially when we was down, that nigga picked niggas up
Gangbang on NY stages, hit niggas up (Death Row)
Y'all remember that? (Yup)
Yeah, he did some bullshit, I'm admitting that
But coming at a real Crip like he ain't one
Especially when he helped fucking make one
On the dead homies, I was at the motherfucking top
When I hit my nigga up and said, "You need to grab 'Pac"
Told Daz, "Hook him up," brought straight up out the box
Here's the gang, here's the beats, here's the keys, here's the locks
Then he hit them niggas (Yes, sir), it was us, cuz
Look around, it still is just us, cuz (Yeah)
Dre rich, Nate gone, and Ricky too
And look at me, shit, I'm 'bout to turn 50 soon
You always said I'd be a star in the game
Now I got a star on the fucking Walk of Fame (Yes, sir)
I hopped out and C-walked on my star on the fuckin' Walk of Fame
In that motherfucking Death Row chain, nigga

I know you seen that
A lot of motherfuckers don't know
Shit, nigga, we been cool
This man changed my life
Shit, nigga, we made history together
I'm talking about real history, nigga, like
When they write the history books they gonna look at this shit like
The Great Depression
You know, the stock exchange
This shit is historic, man
Death Row Records, man, we did that shit, nigga
Suge Knight, real nigga, man
Think about all the great shit you did, nigga
Let bygones be bygones
Yeah, what up, Dre?
Daz, Kurupt, what up though?
Lady of Rage, RBX, D.O.C
Nate Dogg, rest in peace
Ricky Harris, rest in peace
DJ Warren G, Dr. Dre
City of Compton, City of Long Beach
Death Row Records will go down in history, nigga
We did that, yeah, nigga, we did that

Ayy ayy step back motherfucker, watch out!
La la la la la we don’t give a fuck
Ayy y’all niggas ain’t fucking with us, nigga
La la la la la
I'ma get it like this nigga

Yo I got the green, Don Juan
I’m in the hood, blow the horn, bom-bom
This pimping ain't for free, here’s a coupon
My backwoods packs I turn to a futon
I got my eyes on seven figures
And I'ma get it whether I move crooked like Jack Thriller’s
I’m shitting on 'em, I smell like a winner
Don't hit the bathroom for like 40/45 minutes
Redman and we up in this bitch, huh
I never cruise, I work to be the top gun
And I’m a dog off the collar, the marijuana globetrotters
You got bud, I holler

Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)

It's the four horsemen call reinforcements
We ain't looking for endorsements, we absorb your portions
We can roll the indo or sativa if you need to
Got a warehouse poppin' with the B she's a heater
Two on the lighter with tightest bitches, dancing getting higher
They all fire ladies never tire
Got her soul inspired now we flossing out
Sipping on some Hen 2.0, for your cotton mouth
This beat is banging like a Cali block in the 90s
Really fucking grimey and the po-po's right behind me
16's popping, smoke blowing out the window
When we roll up in the spot it's very simple

Uh, yeah, uh-uh
That's what you do
Mt. Kushmore in the building
Big Snoop, Method Man, Redman, B-Real
Shout out to Wiz Khalifa and Sen Dog, you know! G-yeah!

I ain't here to bring the East back (nah), I'm here to relapse
And now I'm outta rehab they ask me where the weed at
Go get a weed app (homie), I got that weed that have your P.O getting P.O, ask me where to pee at
My G, pack the streets of New York, I give em G-Rap
I'm cool, on the road to riches to get my G back
I'll bee dat! Killa Beez mind your beeswax
Past 10 o'clock when ya still don't know where your seat at
Ask Big Snoop, it don't take a Crip to see that
Be real, what you read about Meth Man, believe that
I'm nice, I gots no chill, go get a ski hat
In fact, put ya twitter on ice, chill with the feedback

From the days of Cheech & Chong, to Willie Nelson
Everywhere that I go, I blow fo sho, you smelled it
A lot of y'all fucking with me, saying I'm on your bucket list
But I ain't the one to be fucking with
See, I'm like a quick game of tic-tac-toe
Take three in a row
Aye lil nigga, gon hit that door
I'm back with my niggas Earth wind, no snow
And I got the fire on Mt. Kushmore
So let it rain like the leaves of a cannabis plant
When I say it, I mean it as a matter of fact
Well I outta, slip mo dick in your daughter, for starters
Leafs by Snoop, may I take your order?

Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)

Ain't nobody fucking with my dogs

Whenever I'm down and out I get back to myself
I roll a motherfucking fat bat to myself
Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her
Til she finally did it
Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing unto the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree
If I had my way at 4:20 every day you could blaze a J
And not have to answer to nobody
I live my life like it's a party
So let's go cuz

So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nananana

I blaze up soon as I raise up from out of my sleep
I got me a sweet
I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of police
You think you could smoke like me & Snoop, don't try to compete
I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up
If smoking weed is going down, then I'ma show up
Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so
You don't like edibles? Then I got plenty of flowers to blow
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong
Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song
And do it however you please, you please
Today's the day to smoke weed

So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana

Damn, a pound ain't really nothing now
Remember smoking with my cousin
Now we all Raw cone stuffing
Enough to wake neighbors up
KK my favorite flavor
And you ain't gotta ask cause we major
I smoke like them old players
Only put it in the paper
I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me
Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking
Smell it through the bag so it's potent
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it
A pothead but I be focused
And it ain't in my session if it's bullshit
Only the best what you dealing with
It's legal now, everybody's doing this

So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up
So go ahead and put your J's up
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana na

Come and smoke with me tonight, tonight

[Song 78: One Blood, One Cuzz]
25 ContributorsOne Blood, One Cuzz Lyrics
Top of the morning, there's just something I wanted to address real quick. You know, there's a lot of people that didn't, like, really appreciate the Unity Walk yesterday. Don't like peace and all that, and I understand. When I was out there, I didn't understand it either. They couldn't talk peace with me. They tried, and I was like, "Nigga, that's schoolyard." You can't find a home in my generation that put in more work than me. You may find one or two that put in as much as me, but you ain't gon' find none that put in more than me. And I'm here to tell you that shit was worthless, bro. When they try to peace, I don't wanna peace. Look where I'm at. This shit ain't cool, bro. Crazy part of this, you go this way to me, two steps that way, you got 60s. You go two steps this way, you got Bloods. We wait for each when we walk to trial, bro. We united in here. Nigga might not hang with a nigga every day, but we know we got each other's backs. And I don't knock y'all out there that ain't with the peace, but don't get on people that are. Some people's just tired of this shit, bro.

One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one

For God so loved the world he gave us a good Crip
The late, great Neighborhood Nip
Dippin' in this L.A. bullshit
'Bout as solid of youngsta as a nigga could get (Yup)
Wasn't nothin' like these thug phonies
Was always showin' love and big respect for all the Blood homies (What up)
You understood the values in the youth
Man, I swear to God, nephew, you was the truth
Damn, how could this nigga do this?
It's 'cause every neighborhood Jesus got a neighborhood Judas
Who hate to see your team ridin' rich
You see that envy and that pride, that's that green-eyed bitch
Worse than a woman scorned (Damn)
It had been better for that man if he had never been born
But Mary, don't you mourn, Martha, don't you weep
You see, your son still affected us deep
Give us the faith to take that leap

One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one

All it take is one, one, one brave Blood and one brave Crip
Standing up together like we did back on them slave ships
Out on high sea waves, fighting other whips
Steady hearing "Jesus saves" out of devils lips
Shackled at the hips for the color of our skin
Hundreds of us, yeah, we knew we was brothers then
But here we go again, underneath the gun
They got us thinkin' we all different when we (One)
So I'm givin' thanks to the gangstas, givin' praise to the neighbors
Damus and Pirus, y'all got the whole world amazed

24 Contributors21 Jumpstreet LyricsSong by Snoop Dogg from Murder Was The Case (1994)
Smoking a fat sack, right here on the station that plays
Only platinum hits, W Ballz
My dicks in your ear, caller you wanna say what?
Hello? Hello? Caller?
Oh the hell with it
This is something new for the underground
In the L.B... See you when I get back
Dedicated to the East Side, Two One Street
My favorite and your favorite
Snoop Froggy Dogg and somebody new Tha Dogg Pound
Check it out right here on the station that plays only platinum hits
187.4 on your FM dial
We be taking caller number 21 for those Janet Jackson tickets
So call in, 310-D.A.P.O.U.N.D
That's 310-P.O.U.N.D. bitch
That's Da Pound

Hear ye, hear ye, come one come all
It's the first annual G-nic and all my Doggs
Are invited, so go on and light it
Cause it's the first time in a long time (right)
Reminiscing about the Fresh Fest back in '85
When the Dubs and Insaniacs used to hoo ride
On motherfuckers like it was the thing to do
Eighty-five, eighty-fo', eight-three, and year eighty-two (eighty-two)
You know what the fuck I'm talking about
After party on the lake at the big homie's house
And bet nobody bring a motherfucking gun
Cause everybody in the house's from two-one...

Twenty-first street, burst street, where it all started
And you know East Side, Long Beach, the hardest
Niggas coming realer than The Real McCoy
So step with your rap and we bring the noise
It's the gang of fly bitches, homiez on the switches
Dice in the back if ya wanna get your riches
No snitches allowed inside the crowd
Cause this is the G thang, East Side L.B.C. brang
Finna have some fun represent two-one
And bet nobody bring a mothafucking gun and a...

Yeah, King Park was the location
And to be a G, that was my destination
(We were) lookin' up to niggas coming up before me
And L.B.C. into my East Side homies..... (It's like)

Nobody can see you, but you (yeah, the East Side's perfect)
Nobody can see you, but you (ha ha, now that's worth it)
Nobody can see you, but you (hell yeah, the East Side's perfect)
Nobody can see you, but you (ha ha, yeah, now that's worth it)
Tatataratatatara...

If ya bring a strap, then ya have to trip
So if you on a mission, nigga, go'n and dip
We got meat to eat, freaks to meet
And chronic we can smoke on, and forever get our loc on
Strolling through the Park one day
Puffing on a fat ass J, with my homie named Tray
Deee tryin' to see if we could put this LBC thing
Back together like it was supposed to see

Cause ya know I'm down with ya, to make 'em get the picture
And if I have to sit ya, down then I spit ya
Game from the heart, I came from the start
See I was regulating, when Cragars was the Daytons

Nigga let me interact with my black croaker sacks*
And a gray golf hat tilted to the back (what's up?)
Ditchin' Sunday school to get a pack of Now and Laters
While I'm rolling with the Steelers and killin' with the raiders

And when we bang with the Saints then we ain't no joke
Come around from outta bounds and we goes for broke

Now we're breaking 'em up (hmm hmm), shaking em up (yeah)
And just for a second we're waking 'em up
(continue) Giving up game on this tight ass beat
With a small dedication, to two-one street

Sky  high, smokin' on a PJ, G shit, bangin' on replay
OG snoop, no webay
I don't see nothin' but the G way, my eyes on green like I'm DeRay
Money and kush, weed in my hands, burger in the bush, gettin' my bands
Shit gettin major, got my own brand, whole lotta flavors, hunnid thousand in the stands
Everybody feelin' good, ain't nobody out there hatin' today
Nah, smoke it, make it understood
Hit the kush and let it take you away, 'way

Had a girl in São Paulo, I'll fly her right now
Don't send me emoji with the bright eyebrow
Tell me something good right now
I'm feelin' like, ooh, ooh

Okay
This KK got me feelin' cray-cray
I just got a pound and I smoked it all the same day
This cookie got me feelin' like a rookie
I just took three puffs, got super high, that's how it should be
This purple got me in a circle
Better slow it down before you hit it, it'll hurt you
This lemon got me feelin' finished
I won't ever stop, been blowin' smoke since the beginnin'
Ya' feel me?

I said this kush is gonna take me away (Yup), 'way (Let's go), away (Let's go)

Fa shizzle dizzle, it's the big Neptizzle
With the Snoopy D-O-Double Gizzle
(Snoop Dogg)
C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg)
Hehe, yeah, C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg)
A-ha-ha! C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg)

Bam, boom, what you gon' do, cuz?
Guess who rollin' in, with them baby blue Chucks?
And I've still got my khakis creased
I'm still loc'n on these beats and keep a bad bitch on the streets
It's the S-N-double-O-P'n
Biggest dogg of 'em all, and youse a flea'n
And since I got time to drop it for you, I guess I must
And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust
I keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust
And can't none of y'all fuck with us
But you can run up on the G, but that's not thinkin' wisely
These thrillers are "Contagious", just like Ron Isley
What the hell is goin on? Someone's sleepin' in my home
Snoop to the D-O-Double G (Uh-huh)
Get in where you fit in, follow me (Ooh)

Who's the man with that dance? (Snoop Dogg)
Who keep the khakis for all his pants? (Snoop Dogg)
Keep the low-low in a three-wheel stance (Snoop Dogg)
Still got the "Gin and Juice" in hand (Snoop Dogg)

I do it for the G's and I do it for the hustlers
Here to annihilate you mark-ass busters
Eff the police cause all they wanna do is cuff us
The world is fuckin' chilly as if his name was Usher
But I'm still ridin' them 'llacs, makin them G stacks
And got them cornrows to the back
I ain't really tryin to be picky
But if you give me somethin, it's got to be the sticky
Green by the ounces, low-lows bouncin
Sandy Fay and Annie Mae kissin on my couch and
Ooh to the ouch and, Moet fountain
That's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n
This year we ain't fuck with thousands
We clean with millions that get fly as a falcon
Pull up to the Doggy Dogg palace
With a car fulla bitches cookin grits like Alice (ooh!)

Who's the man with that dance? (Snoop Dogg)
Who keep the khakis for all his pants? (Snoop Dogg)
Keep the low-low in a three-wheel stance (Snoop Dogg)
Still got the "Gin and Juice" in hand (Snoop Dogg)

Three 14-inch rims are running on the side
(They're riding on the side?) Yeah they running on the side!
Three 14-inch rims are running on the side
(They're riding on the side?) Yeah they runnin on the side!
Three 14-inch rims are running on the side
(They're riding on the side?) Yeah they runnin on the side!
Three 14-inch rims are running on the side
(They're riding on the side?) Yeah they running on the side!

Take two and pass it. It will not burn you
From the Long Beach Chronicles to the Wall Street Journal
They all know the G with the Cutlass Coupe
Ask Bill Gates, ("Yeah I know the homie Snoop")
Yeah, I'm straight loc'n, hangin wit my folk and
Follow Rakim cause "I Ain't No Joke" and
Cuz, I done seen so much (like what?)
Enough to have your feelings touched
When the gunshots ratta, all your boys scatter
Check up on your homies, but they gave ya bad data
Make a nigga stop BREATHIN, have his soul relievin'
And now you niggas believe in
What I say cause what I say is so real
Homie you don't wanna see the steel!
You dont wanna catch a body, you came here to party
Now that's what you should do, now where's my baby boo? (ooh!)

Who's the man with that dance? (Snoop Dogg)
Who keep the khakis for all his pants? (Snoop Dogg)
Keep the low-low in a three-wheel stance (Snoop Dogg)
Still got the "Gin and Juice" in hand (Snoop Dogg)

Yeah, no introduction, is needed
But for those who STILL, refuse to accept
The reading on the wall, for the new Mack-allenium
This is the Archbishop Don Magic Juan
Chairman of the Board, of famous players EVERYWHERE
And I'm puttin it down with Big Snoop Dogg, the legend

And I can see you with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

Sippin' yac while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate
Never going down, stay rising like Andre
'Cause my corner back every thing the don say
Long Beach, yeah, I yell it out in every song
Err'y day, err'y night till I'm carried home
Forever known, big ballin', try it in the city
Then yelling out, "swish", way before it in the net
And I ain't knocking a niggas hustle, it's all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin', bitch, taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP

And I can see you with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

I do it 'cause I feel it
Live it like I'm talkin'
Flow so straight but won't a nigga try and walk in it
I'm so high, yeah the weed, I'm still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like parkinsons
Bread's in the bag, call it good marketing
Life's a bitch but I don't cardigan
That's what a word to the third letter
Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee's I'm tougher than leather
Vietnamese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg, I'm biting whomever
'Cause I done came from a long path
Only God knows how long left the Dogg has
'Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it's from a tall glass

And I can see you with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

I sold my soul to the devil, that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
'Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery, get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks, I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the world
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell rings?
It's feeling like hell rings
It's bringing me back down, he's checking my background
It's ironic what's happening, imagine if I didn't have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I'm spaced out, dawg, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain't finna change, so we won't agree again
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

And I can see you with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed

Let's roll out to Miami and get the money
Baby how that sound?
When I'm feelin' high, I'm probably on some light skin
When I'm feelin' low, I'm sippin' on some brown
Won’t you come trips to California?
We can get with it, show you how the shit goes down
Know around the world, it get nasty
And I'ma be right there, as long as where it's
That's where the cash be

(Hey! Woo!) Cash be

Letty said he can play with them broads
Opportunistic, I stay on them hoes
I ain't got time to be hanging with y'all
'Specially when there is no money involved
Joint seem mighty long, red beam on his dome
Point seen, money gone

Let's roll out to Miami and get the money

When I'm feelin' low, I'm sippin' on some brown

Robert De Niro, fly as a sparrow
Profit to profit, arrow to pharaoh
Live bueno, hustle like Maino
All money in, no Drano
Can't no-body get it like I get mines
More paper to Jamaica, I make it, bake it, shape it and cake it
Remake it, never had to fake it to make it
Just put the pedal to the metal, rock it up and re-flake it
I'm living the fast life
Jet after jet and tryna keep my cash right
I know you understands the meaning
Hand full of green and while the fans keep fiending
Straight up, no leaning, I'm right where the chips at
Or even in the hood where the Crips at
Joint seem mighty long, red beam on his dome
Point seen, money gone

Let's roll out to Miami and get the money
Baby how that sound?

When I'm feelin' low, I'm sippin' on some brown

And I'ma be right there, right where my cash be
I need y'all to the stage, let's go
Yeah, yeah
I need y'all on the stage, let's go
Work (Work, work)

In a white Ghost sipping holy water
Always been the type to get it close to border
After play, Barry Bonds, out the park
I got hits, what you mean? I throw the dart
At the wall, off the wall, I feel like Mike
I don't miss, niggas talkin' shit, say I
Took his bitch, hit that pussy, it took one night
Hit that hoe quit, it was just aight
Uhh, not at all
I ain't get to see the wall, I copped 'em all
Fucked it all, fuck the law, fuck you thought?
I ain't change, seen my chain look like the car
Flash man, flashy dancing, dancing on me
Dirty dancing, dancing like my double cup
Lemonade to niggas that be talking tough
Say you got money, I just double up
Multiply, fuck addition, fuckin bitches all night
Macauley Culkin, rich and riches
This the life, they walk away, it's so delicious
Up in Dubai, sushi, hella bitches
Aw man, wrote a check, two commas
Please tell em' I need two shots by two o' clock
Plus that adds about two thousand, two drops
Pull up in my crew, sellin' out

I need a girl who will do whatever I want
I need a girl who will do whatever I want

In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop

I'm the big dog, best beware
You coming with me, if you stop and stare
She'll be on my team, in my car
On the way to the spot, yes you are
Toasting up, hosting us
And when we done, we west coasting love

Chilling with the stars, where the bottles never stop
Got a model on my lap, baby, show me what you got
With a cup of Landy, Tiffany and Sandy
Girls who like girls, wanna do it to daddy
Real talk, tha suites is next
One more drink gon' lead to sex
These girls is bad, the floor is packed
They shut the door down when it reach the max
Whatchu tryna drink? Clear or yak?
She got a apple-bottom, homie, all I do is mack
I does it well, your game is wack

Smoke good with T-Pain, and Snoop the weed doctor
Big 808, now feel the base in your chakra
And watch me smoke like a shotta'
Coke bottle shape, light green eyes
Drunk off of love like a Colt 45
I keep kush in my lungs, I'ma smoke 'til I die
Just bust a bad one, for my homie D. Dimes
They do it for fortune, some for fame
I got five different strains, you ever taste Purple Rain?
Turn up the volume, adjust the game
Ain't a damn thing change, still a G-thang
Lil' mama whip your hair, exhale the chronic
As the smoke disappears, I'm ready to ball
Your girl on my team, and she ready to fall
And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg

Boom!
Say what? Say what?

I don't think they heard you

Talk to 'em, T-Pain

This for all of my niggas pushing the limit
Mile high, got me over here bending the flight attendants
Yeah, I been around the world and I-I-I
Ain't seen a motherfucking thing that I can't buy
See, reaching these types of heights, it come with a third eye
I'm better at betting on me, the numbers don't lie
Huh, that's how we rolling, nigga, you know them gold diggers
Want the pick of the litter, burying them hidden figures
I keep them triple hitters, call 'em silverback gorillas
Going ape shit, and you know ain't nobody fucking with us
Ha, showtime nigga, yeah this is the big ticket
Coach at Compton, I'm talking that King Richard
This shit just like a movie, I'm seeing the bigger picture
Since Snoop couldn't get much higher, but I beg to differ
Uh, on sight, I give you the green light
Some niggas is all bark, my nigga, we all bite
You gambling with your life? Well fuck it, let's roll the dice
There'll be some motherfucking problems if this dog in a fight (That's right)

Maybe I'm just tryna get high (Smoking the legendary)
Thighs high, open them wide (Something like missionary)
Mind if I pull up with a few? (We can arrange that)

And then, and then, just take your money
All I wanna do is bla-bla-bla-blaow

Uh, Hip-Hop, took shit global, we done did it
Huh, wanna see your mogul, we showing you how to pivot
Got this shit from DMC, let's run with it (Check)
Took the fundamentals and have us some fun with it
These songs, King Kong, my team strong
Godzilla, set fire to whatever I breathe on
Got the killers and choir all singing my theme song
(I could never do this alone) Then motherfucker, come on!
Still Dre, still on top, still got it
The sonic still iconic, they still sniffing the product
I seen the money coming, I showed you that I'm a prophet
And I'm riding shotgun in case niggas get out of pocket
Why you wanna press the issue, my nigga, you need to stop it
Keep a lawyer on retainer for depositions and dockets (Uh)
Back to the topic in case you niggas forgot it
Anonymous head bobbing, baby, keep that pussy popping for me

Maybe I'm just tryna get high (Smoking the legendary)
Thighs high, open them wide (Something like missionary)
Mind if I pull up with a few? (We can arrange that)
Pennies dropping outta da blue (You know I bang that)
All I wanna do is bla-bla-bla-blaow
And then, and then, just take your money
All I wanna do is bla-bla-bla-blaow
And then, and then, just take your money

Hey, Snoop Dogg, can you pour me another glass of that Coolaid?
(Cardo Got Wings)

On the set, my nigga, I'm my own man
Upgrade, just like your phone game
Big Snoop Dogg, I do my own thing
And I stays in my own lane
My rap style, is dynamite
A lot of y'all niggas do sound alike
You do it how you do's it
See, you can blame it on the drugs, and you can blame it on the music
Where I come from, if you sound like another nigga
That's called bitin', yeah, you the other nigga
Let my demeanor be the meaning, got you screamin'
While you leanin', now you fiendin', while you dreamin'
To have a big car, rap star
Ten-room mansion with a lake in your backyard
So disobedient, flavor is the main ingredient
And you lack it, it's all in your jacket

But I'm hot, and as cool as a fan
You bitches drinkin' lemonade, I'm the Coolaid Man
Standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man
I'm hot (he's cool), but as cool as a fan
Bitches drinkin' lemonade, but I'm the Coolaid Man
I'm standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man
Now drink up, Mr. Coolaid Man, Mr. Coolaid Man
Now drink up, yeah girl that's the Coolaid Man, they call him the Coolaid Man
Now drink up!

The reason that I say that I'm the Coolaid
Look at all the flavor that I gave to the gizzame
Just add water, it don't get no hotter
You got your whole get-down from the Doggy Dogg father
Never mind it was never mines
Inquire intellectual, clever minds
Bet a dub that this shit pop
Bitch niggas mix love with this hip-hop
Just to be on, now what the fuck are we on
LBC, we've been known to get our G on
They call me Don Corleone, that's the corner he on, P-I-M-P on
She a freak of the week, I'm teachin' niggas how to eat
Cause I'm deep in the streets
Look, don't get it fucked up loc
Cause every now and then, niggas need a line of this dope

Cause I'm hot, and as cool as a fan
You bitches drinkin' lemonade, I'm the Coolaid Man
Standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man
I'm hot (he's cool), but as cool as a fan

Dickies creased up and they saggin'
Gat in the right side, left side flag
Niggas running at the lip again
Got me feelin' I'ma trip again
And you thought I wasn't listenin'
Bitches talking shit, got me walkin' like a Crip again
Gotta hit you with the re-up
I'm married to the streets, fuck a prenup
Ayy lil' nigga roll the weed up
Drank in my cup, we about to get G'd up

Long Beach on my right side
CPT on my left side
I got Watts in this bitch
It be dogs from the 'jects still screaming out West Side
Long Beach on my right side
CPT on my left side
I got Watts in this bitch
Tiny loccs from the third and they screaming out East Side

Bitch niggas still bang on 'em
50 Cal shots, let it rang on 'em
And if a square ass nigga tried to get up in my circle
We gon' have to put them thangs on 'em
Bitch niggas  still bang on 'em
50 Cal shots, let it rain on 'em
And if a square ass nigga tried to get up in my circle
We gon' have to put them thangs on 'em
Still say fuck 'em cause ain't no love for 'em
Tell 'em come and see me, I got a slug for 'em
But then again I ain't brainless
I'll have my little loccs hit you with the stainless
Still say fuck 'em cause ain't no love for 'em
Tell 'em come and see me, I got a slug for 'em
But I ain't tryna make ya famous
I'll have my tiny locos hit you with the stainless
Bitch you know who I be

It's enough of that to go around
Real G's make the hood go 'round
Keep the planet spinnin' on it's axis
How is he so hood? How can you ask this?
I guess you can say I put in practice
On the strip, under lights, now I'm back bitch
And even if I'm blown on my own
With the chrome to your dome
Make you stretch like elastic
I need my real G's to the left
Bitch niggas staying to the right
I need my hoes front and center
Hard on these hoes from the Summer to the winter
Spring to the Fall, hoes still on my balls
It's the number one nigga from the hood  Doggy Dogg
Still pull up on a nigga when I need to be heard
I'm a killer and a stealer, but I ain't from Pittsburgh
Real shit on the set, I get your whole clique served
You best observe, a B chalked out on the curb
With your momma and your people sayin' "Supercrip did it"
They won't testify, so he got away with it
Now I'm sttin' on my throne, on my Bat phone
I'm talkin' to Iron man, while smokin' some fire, man
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Walkin' through the clouds with a Crip stick cane

Super Crip, what?
Super Crip, who?
Super Crip, what?
Super Crip, who?
Super Crip, what?
It's still 187 if you bitch niggas wanna trip, who?
Super Crip, what?

It's still 187 if you bitch niggas need that

Keep saying "I do this, I do that" but, you know
I just keep doing the same shit, haha
My fault, hahaha

I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I (But I)
Prolly never change (Change)
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I
Prolly be the same (Same)

Every time I try to get my life together someone seems
Whatcha doing tryna ruin my hopes and my dreams
Push away and always go get away
And keep some grams in my pants have a hit a day
Am I wrong am I right, do I care, living life
On my own, cop a zone, what it feeling like
Transition crimination whatch you call it mack upon
Do my thang with my gang put your back up on
Recollect and reflect on how I used to be
I'm probably the same way cud' cause I'm goin' keep it G
Secretly sactredly yall wake and bake with me
Solo creepin on the dolo tippin' like a lolo
Fans come in vans with they clans expecting to get that photo
Won't need to come back stage and have a chance to hit my dodo
Cool individual, I'm never too good
See Mack is from the hood and never Hollywood

I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I (But I)
Prolly never change (Change)
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I

Uh, growing up I ain't know as much
I was too busy chasing money and rolling stuff for I was old enough
Getting every dollar and fold it up
Putin' all my weed in papers instead of blunts so they could know it's us
Every party we showing up, baggy full of pre-rolls
Light it up and pass it you holding that one too long nigga matter fact you can have it
Another one in rotation my motivation is cabage my Rollie face filled with carrots
And niggas think they are but they know that they ain't comparing
And they ain't doing no harm but I don't think I'm really caring
I keep making deposits and no way no interference
From your broke ass, I just keep hustlin all the time and gettin more cash
And rolling weed you smell the chronic when I go past
You look at me and then put down notes on your notepad
Yeah, I'm kinda high, but you should know that

I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I (But I)
Prolly never change (Change)
I'm not tryna be a right, tryna be a wrong
I just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I
Prolly be the same (Same)

Got a room full of bitches and they lying there
High in there, ain't no fire, but a lot of wine in there
They get it, ain't no WiFi
On the low, close the door, bitch, I Spy
See when I pull up, jump in, we slip out
Roll up, roll out, get mines, dip out

Out of pocket, never that stayin' in stripper's place
Big brown ass with some fat titties

Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Used to whip a Lexus
I can die right now, still a legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Born to be a legend
A motherfucking legend

1996, I beat a 187 (murder was the case)
80 million sold, and I ain't check the records
Checked a couple rappers, told 'em not to test me
Ask me who am I? Motherfucking legend
50 bitches naked
Nike ain't my preference
Khaki with the Chucks
Now look how they dressing
Perfected my profession
Someone call the reverend (Nate Dogg nigga)
Bury me alive, living legend

Motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Even if I die, living Legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend

Look, big dog, six broads, don't matter to me
You new niggas look madder than me
Came up with the Doc, been around the world with 'Pac
Don't compare another rapper to me
When I came and kicked them buildings over
Swear I always knew I'd never be the same
Was born to be a motherfucking legend
I ain't never do it for no fucking fame
Motherfucking legend
You know what I'm repping
20 million, 20 years ago
Cuh, you was like 7
You ain't gotta like it
Bitch you gon' respect it (Respek on my name!)
Look me in my eye
Motherfucking legend

Motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Even if I die, living Legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Used to whip a Lexus
I can die right now, still a legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Born to be a legend
A motherfucking legend

Mix purple with the yella
Kobe with Vanessa
Did it doggy style
Like upon the dresser
Look at my reflection
Motherfucking legend
Even when I die

Smoking smoking weed
Havin a party (Bring the weed)
I'm going to invite her
I got my lighter (Got a blunt)
I'm getting higher
Smoking smoking weed

Jumped out my bed and I head downstairs
Wiped the boogers out my eyes. put some braids in my hair
Grabbed my favorite toothbrush and then some crest
Rinse my mouth out, now I'm ready for the rest
Break it down, roll it up, pass if you've had enough
You're with the big boss Dogg so go and puff puff
Real talk, can you still walk?
Have a seat, have a drink, now rest your feet
See that's the problem, you think that you can go with me?
Smoking cest your whole life, now you wanna blow with me
Go to the store with me and get some swishy sweet
And grab a bite to eat before you fall out
I'm a ball out and everyday, we're going to smoke until we all out
And that's a promise cuh, we got the bombest bud
And you can ask Ray J, he knows what time it was
(Smoking, smoking weed)

In the Cadillac, with my head back
Feeling real good cause it's like that
Another 20' sack we've got plenty' that
We keep doing that

Smoking smoking weed
Smokin on these trees, keeps me at ease With these
Crazy things I see
Smokin on these trees, keeps me it seems
And I don't just where I'd be - smoking smoking weed

Havin a party (Bring the weed)
I'm going to invite her
I've got my lighter (Got a blunt)
I'm getting higher
Wish you would pass it (guess I'll wait)
I'm right beside her
I got an ashtray (at my place)
Where did my pipe go?

So what you got nigga? (knockout)
I got the cush and the yerp
Packaged in P's to keep the feds of my chirp
Uhh cause my nerves' on alert
Paranoid like your boy cookin up the work
Look pimpin I ain't touching that dirt
I ain't smokin that shit
It'll make your whole head hurt
I got the card for the cataract
Doctor say it's legal
To twist up green
Call it Philadel eagle (shortymack)
Knockout pays me my check
Silver haze blowin out the Lamborghini air vents
I got the blunts and a pound of leaves
I been the purp man plus I got that OG

(I wanna) roll it, roll it, twist that, twist that
(I wanna) fire it up, then get that, get that
(I wanna) pass it around, get bent back bent back
Give it back to me! (Smoking smoking weed)

Havin a party (Bring the weed)
I'm going to invite her
I've got my lighter (Got a blunt)
I'm getting higher
Wish you would pass it (guess I'll wait)
I'm right beside her
I got an ashtray (at my place)
Where did my pipe go?

(Slim Thugga Muh Fugga)
Blaze in the bush of that cush
You gotta pull hard then push
I blow dro but to each his own
And I keep shit fit like Cheech and Chong
We can be outta town
We can be at home
I keep a good connect for that Cali grown
Weed so strong you can smell it through the sac
It's in the backpack in the trunk of the 'lac
It's a buck that's a fact
Won't accept nothin less
So you can smoke alone
On your sack of stress (yes)
Pass the cush, let me hit that next
Slim thugga muh fugga
I smoke the best

Havin a party (Bring the weed)
I'm going to invite her
I've got my lighter (Got a blunt)
I'm getting higher
Wish you would pass it (guess I'll wait)
I'm right beside her
I got an ashtray (at my place)
Where did my pipe go?

Ha ha it's your boy Ray J
You know what? I'm a roll up one right now
And celebrate a lil bit
You know Raydiation in stores right now
Ya'll go get it
Shortymack comin real soon
It's about to get ugly

And Lucky Luciano 'bout to sing soprano
And I know, I know the way you feel
And baby bubba we gon' keep it on the real
Just to get you caught up in amazement
We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous
But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha
How you feelin'? I'm out the ceiling, ridin' like a villan
Makin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd with my new hairdo
Outfits from Hugh, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes
Man, I give the blues to these sucka MC's
Who you be? You know who I be, young nigga
I'm Tha DoggFather

Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)

Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)
We got's to get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)
I mean I steps to the stage in my G-boy stance
And say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance
I'm so fly like a dove, I come from up above
You trippin' on your girl 'cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat 'em, 'cause if you beat 'em, you don't need 'em
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom
I delete 'em, and don't mistreat 'em
I stay up on 'em, but that's one ta grow on, let me flow on
You can rock to the rhythm you see
Or you can rock to the rhythm of me, me, me
But when you do your thang, make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everythang, is everythang
Man, I'm on this paper chase
Like them white-boy DA's was on the case
But you know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh
Murder (Murder, murder) was the case that they lost
I'm Tha DoggFather

Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)

Now, do anybody in the house remember
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC
Am I trippin' y'all? (Hell no!)
Now, when I grow up, I wanna be like Snoop
Have prestigious women and stay true from the beggining
In and out of the flyest hotels
They say your family don't know me
Hold on homie, that's promo and foremost
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death, no one in my clique fails
As we bails with the almighty Fatherly
Exceeding to give our peep's what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind
'Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
But I'ma get back to the grizzind
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and
I'm tha DoggFather

Yeah, uh (Ridas)
Wanna say what's up to all them riders (Biatches)
All them siders, all them gangstas, and all them beyotches
Yeah, we keep it gangsta (Gangstas, bitches)
Yeah, we keep it gangsta

Dippin' down Long Beach Coulevard
I only rides with my Doggs (Wha-what)
And I don't give a fuck about none of y'all
I'm ridin' 'til the wheels fall off
I only rides with my Doggs (Wha-what)
Dippin' down Compton Boulevard
I only rides with my dogs (Say what)
I don't give a fuck about none of y'all (Fuck y'all)
I'm ridin 'til the wheels fall off
I only rides with my dogs

Beware of the big mash, you knew he wasn't finished with yo' ass
He'll stay on it 'til it's burnt out, looked how it turned out
Nothin' you can do now can help you out
So fall down, Dr. Dre done fell back into the House (DPG)
With the Pound, bitches keep throwin' pussy at us
We don't want it, you bitch it don't matter
It's all about the money, if you got it, throw that up (Throw it up)
Hmm, ride along with ya' set (Eastside)
And watch us, you motherfuckers can't do that yet
I skirt out, I hit a corner on ya, fuck doin' halfway
I do it to the fullest, I'll probably catch bullets on my last day
I hope a prayer come through so I can eat
My shoes lookin' like about a buck fifty each (But I ain't trippin')
But I'ma come up, that's on my mama
Now that's on me, 'cause that's a burden on my mama
And she done suffered, the shit's gettin rougher
And when the goin' get tough, the tough get a strap
And low-ridin's on the map Snoop Dogg's number 1
The whole Pound's got snaps (nigga)
Yeah, tell me, have you seen us?

Bendin' corners on gold Daytonas, we heated, so beat it
However you want it, nah, however you need it (We just dippin')
Bendin' corners on gold Daytona's, we heated, so beat it
However you want it, nah, however you need it (We just dippin')
Bendin' corners on gold Daytonas, we heated, so beat it
However you want it

Uh, actin' a fool, nigga done paid his dues
And got my receipt in return, so I recline the leather seats
With a trunk full of beats and
Chronic filled leafs to burn
No concern as I make a left turn on the 'Shaw ('sup nigga)
Off of Jefferson, feelin' awfully naked at the U-turn
Shit, left my gun, that's a no-no
Fuck Bernard Parks, I'm my own po'-po'
Nigga talkin' dirty after dark, startin' stuff (what's up nigga)
May have to mark up a nigga FUBU logo
Lettin off like a Ruger promo
And even though I'm about the hoes, I never doubt the dulos
You know the rule goes, where there's a ho there's a hater
(Fuck them niggas) Well there's some hoes over there
And I concentrate on the haters later (what)
Give these bitches numbers to the pager
Invite 'em to the next Dre function as party favors
Who said pimpin's hard labor?

Bendin' corners on gold Daytonas, we heated, so beat it
However you want it, nah, however you need it (We just dippin')
Bendin' corners on gold Daytonas, we heated, so beat it
However you want it, nah, however you need it (We just dippin')

You think long, you've been wrong, get it out your mind
Make you move when you hear them screaming, "Ho"
Cause I gotta go

I don't need no bitch

My mama told me never ever trust one, bust one and break ‘em
Be about your paper nigga take it
Everyday’s a hustle, got these haters at my neck
Suckers tryna get a check
Boss dogg does it, hoes wanna call it what it wasn’t
Tryna kiss a nigga all in public, bitch, is you crazy?
I preach pimping not pussy, shit I heard it all before
I ain’t no motherfuckin rookie (I don't need no bitch, bitch, bitch)
I’m a long beach, grown twenty? playa ’bout his g’s
I ain’t tripping off these walls
You know these rats is after cheese
Messing with my focus, the locust on his grind
They be focus on this dick and keep your focus off my time
Stay in the lane that I made for you to chill
Until then it’s been real, I gotta handle business
And you I know we’re in it, see tripping gets you nowhere
Cause bitch i’m on that

I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it I’m out here grinding
That's why I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…

We used to rock to the rhythm that didn’t stop
Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch
Cause it’s over and through
But why do I need a bitch when I got you (I don't need no bitch, bitch, bitch)
I don’t mean it like it sounds, but we used to be a team
Yo, we used to have a dream yo, we used to put our things together
Now it’s dividing, hiding, bottled up negative feelings inside
These bitches, they come a dime a dozen (Bitches)
Fuck one that once sucked my dick and find another (Bitches)
I don’t need ‘em, don’t buy ‘em nothing to drink, I don’t feed them (Bitches)
Never mind them, I stay in front, I used to chase behind them(bitches)
No, I don’t wine and dine them

I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it I’m out here grinding
That's why I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…

Hell no, I don’t need one
And all that talking and fussing bitch you can miss me
I put these size twelves down on a 10 speed
Before I let a bitch get the best of me (I don't need no bitch, bitch, bitch)
The recipe for danger, phone checking, the recipe for anger
I’m from a gang but I don’t wanna bang ya
And I can tell how you tell all your friends about my Benz and my ears? bitch
Really I’m the perfect stranger, which turned you to the perfect stalker
Body like Miss Parker, maybe get little darker
But I’ma have to pass on that ass you was too much in the first place
Never understood when it was work day (I don't need no bitch, bitch, bitch)
And then she all up on your boy in the worst way
You need to detox, bitch see Dr. Dre
Cause crazy ain’t gonna get it, and tripping get you nowhere
Cause bitch I’m on that, bitch I’m on that

I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
I don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don’t even try it I’m out here grinding
That's why I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…

You need to quit talking crazy
I don’t need no bitch
You need to quit talking crazy

You wanna study with me?
That'd be nice, yeah

I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
Five days out the week, my stays out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

Honeydew, money do, but this ain't about no money
This is 'bout me and you making ooh, take it from me
First day of school I'm looking cool, I got my clothes pressed
I'm a senior but I'm seeming like an old vet
Time will pass me by if I don't graduate this time so I expand my mind
Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it
Reinstate it, look at you girl, you got me dedicated

I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
Five days out the week, my stays out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

Uh, put me on the game
Though I keep my head in these books, I'm not a lame
Usually kinda square, I'm trying new shit for a change
Telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gone need a lot of brains
And just cause I don't play, who say I can't ball?
My nigga Mac, dude me and him is in the same hall
So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on
Just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall

I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
Five days out the week, my stays out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

Devin there you are, look at my repertoire
Spitting game, you know for reppin hard
Change that perspective, that's my objective
Cool and oh so collective, connected
Check this, I need you more that you could know
See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow
Let it go, let me know where to meet at
Student of the week, baby I will be that, you know I need that, come on

I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
Five days out the week, my stays out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

Call you on your phone and never come see you
Darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you
Just to try to know where you at
Call you on your phone and never come see you
Darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you
Just to try to know where you at

I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
Five days out the week, my stays out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

[Song 106: Midnight Love]

Midnight love
Midnight love
Midnight love
Midnight love

Midnight love
Troubled Glocks gon' be .9
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little Joe, he's callin' for you

I'm makin' things happen fast
Ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along
Face lookin' stupid, broke, startin' feelin' dumb
I'm young but I'm a grown man
Takin' thangs into my own hands, I'm tryna own land
But life'll twist ya like a twister, get twisted with this
It seems on but it's off, I keep missin' this shit
I'm high but I try to stay focused, wide-eyed
Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink, they dip
It's hard to hang on, but I can't let go
Smokin' on my last breath
Blow out life what's left is death
Now I can go wrong or I can G or make a right
Whatever way that I turn, it's still death after life
And if it don't discourage me, I ain't got nothin' to lose
But some thoughts that probably never turn to money to burn
But I learn 'cause I see, and I earn 'cause I G
But, these problems probably have a nigga gray and deceased
At an early age so at an early stage in life
I chose to get my shit tight, you gotta struggle and fight
It cost an arm and a leg just to live on your knees
And I'm tryna keep my sanity, God help me please

Midnight love
Troubled Glocks gon' be .9
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little Joe, he's callin' for you

Mischievous and devious is how my life was
Puttin' the serve down with cavi just to keep the cluckers buzzed
Some of the money makin' motherfuckers from the other side
Was thinkin' about a jack move, tryna whoo-ride
Gettin' jealous 'cause my niggas got this rap game sold up
Them niggas wanna trip (brrr-brat-dat), they got blowed up
Grown up or not, you can still get shot
You don't never play a motherfucker out for his knot
Rule number one, pay attention to this shit
Don't be fuckin' wit' my niggas on the midnight shift, shit (Shit)
He kept gettin' it on to the break of dawn
Now he's known for servin' more than an ozone
He's got a 1-8-7 on his motherfuckin' chest
A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
He's lookin' for them niggas from the night before
12:01 he layin' low all in a nigga back do'

Midnight love
Troubled Glocks gon' be .9
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little Joe, he's callin' for you

Now it's all about the dollars, Impalas that bounce
Havin' cars and bitches, havin' a proper amount
Quarter million chillin', robbin' banks and mini-markets
Sunlight when dark hits, we all get it started, coldhearted
Get around, my life won't change for the good
It seems soon I walk out the door, I'm called by the hood
Daz, would you come and ride for me?
Ayo Daz, you da soldier, would you die for me?
The hood traditions got a lot of niggas killed for dumb shit
The OG's think they run shit, the youngsters control shit
Every midnight I be loaded, high as a kite
Society with the drama when the dogg fight, street fight
Ain't allowed in my book no mo'
Problems get solved when we revolve with ammo and a .4-4
But sure I get the rep and blast five times
254 sentenced to jail time

Midnight love
I've been walkin' the street
Midnight love
I put my life on the line
Midnight love
'Cause I just gotta be me
Midnight love

Midnight love
Troubled Glocks gon' be .9
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
Just have it ready for me
Back door little Joe, he's callin' for you

[Song 108: Everything]
9 ContributorsEverything Lyrics
You got everything you want
You got everything you need
Yes, I remember the times
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women weren't mine
So you stuck by my side
So everything

Everything you want and need
I'll comfort you, give you all of me
'Cause everything you want and need
I'll be, I'll be

It'll be you and me
For eternity
I give you my love every day, yeah
I'ma be yours either way

You and your niece, me and Jacquees
We can make love in between them sheets
All you can eat on me, it's a feast
Have fun with me while I run these streets
So sweet, so rough, so tough, so bad
Get what you want, throw it in the bag
Stayed down wit' me even when I did wrong
That's probably why I'm singin' this song
A boss hit, a boss lady, that's you
Put your face on my right arm, tattoo
Met you, got you, get you
You're my angel, God bless you
Who am I in love with? Just you
Float on the boat, just us two
Smokin' and strokin', just us two
This is splendid, flex it and bend it
Lay it out for ya
Now let me play it out for ya
You get what she won't 'cause she don't compare
You get what you want 'cause you have been there for me
Carefully, prepared to lay down your life for me
My life would be nothin' without you
And I ain't doin' nothin' without you

You got everything you want
You got everything you need
Yes, I remember the times
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women weren't mine
So you stuck by my side
So everything

Everything you want and need (Everything)
I'll comfort you, give you all of me (All of me)
'Cause everything you want and need (Want and need)

It'll be you and me (That's all it will be)
For eternity (Yeah)
I give you my love every day (Every day)
I'ma be yours either way (Either way)

He was gettin' money outta town (O.T.)
I was in the city 'bout mine (you know how I do)
And I knew he was a dog, had to put him on pause
But it happened at the right time (it worked out)
And I know you got drip, fast whips and the mansions
But you really need a girl who understands you (for real)
Like when you cash out, know I can too
Yeah, I run through the money, I ain't ran through
And I keep it a hunnid
Good head, down bitch, let him get in my stomach (uh-huh)
First lady, still married to money
It was like a blind date 'cause I ain't see it comin'
Damn, I was on deep, he was still playin'
We was both young till I turned him into a man
Bitches do it for the 'Gram but this really who I am
If you get up in a jam, I'ma come through with the bands
Yeah, my type, no stereo (my nigga)
I love you like that woman that carried you
Back and forth, no merry-go, die for you like burials
I ain't speakin' it up, just givin' you a scenario (just playin')
Yeah, I'm goin' to war if it's 'bout you (all day)
It ain't for me then it's not true (no it ain't)
I wanna be the last one you gotta lie to
I got everything I need if I gotchu

You got everything you want
You got everything you need
Yes I remember the times
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women weren't mine
So you stuck by my side
So everything

Everything you want and need (everything)
I'll comfort you, give you all of me (all of me)
Cause everything you want and need
I'll be, I'll be

It'll be you and me
For eternity
I give you my love everyday
I'ma be yours either way

Yeah, I like to dedicate this record right here to my main man
Johnny Cash, a real American gangster
I got my nephew Whitey Ford on the guitar
Young Trev' on the drums
Grand Ole Opry, here we come, uhh

Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jacked up the spoon on the candlestick
Dopestick pimpin on the one-trick pony
Yeah she kinda skinny but she gets my money
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Yeah, you know I got to have that medicine
That prescription medicine baby
Y'know, purple, orange, green

Jack starts hangin 'round with some fiends
Got strung out, sold the cow for beans
Told young wifey, "I love ya honey
But you gotta hit the streets, go and get my money"
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine

Yeah, the mo' dedicated the mo' medicated
Can you feel me?

Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high
(And I'm high all day, every day)
You can trust every word I'm gonna say will be a lie

Haha, yeah I lie sometimes
What's the use of the truth if you can't get a lie sometimes baby?
Now dig this
Jack starts a track up and down the hill
Got to walkin thinkin ace what he told to Jill
Come rain, come shine, come snow or if it's sunny
Get the fuck out, come and get my money
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Yeah
They say you can't buy me love, but you damn sure can buy me bud

Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high
(Oh I'm so high right now, how 'bout you?)
You can trust every word I'm gonna tell you is a lie
(Liar liar, haha, pants on fire)
Girl I love you (I love you though)
Yeahhhh!

There are times when I don't wanna speak
Grab a pen, scratch your chin, make the beat
Maybe not, smokin' pot on the beach
Paranoid with my boys, where my keys?
And my head in the clouds, is that him?
And my boys trippin' hard like nigga, chill
Someone new with the mouthful of boot
Now my boys, they come in with the deal

I'm not mad at you
Things I'm going through make me act the fool
Please don't think I'm cruel
Really normally I'm cool
There is nothing you can do
Hey
When my words are few
Things ain't what they seem
Feeling like I'm fooling me
I know god is calling me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Sitting here smoking trees
When I should be on my knees
When my words are few

Why you hounding me in the house of the lord?
Watch us, guilty
Ain't no move in the parking lot prophecies
That's why at the benediction, you can't find me
Oh ain't no smiles, ain't no joke
No bitches, please
Ain't no rest for my soul til' I come clean
I'll hear from the lord if I speak
So back off and let me eat, let me feast

I'm not mad at you
Things I'm going through make me act the fool
Please don't think I'm cruel
Really normally I'm cool
There is nothing you can do
Hey
When my words are few
Things ain't what they seem
Feeling like I'm fooling me
I know god is calling me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
Sitting here smoking trees
When I should be on my knees
When my words are few

I know that I chose to backslide
But now I know the way
I was born and raised in this thing
And that's something I chose to do
Church all my life
I ain't stepped outside but now I feel the light calling me
Back to the fold

{*harmonizing*} Never miss what you had 'til it's gone
Yeah, y'all gone miss me

Hmm, who that nigga that brought you that gangsta shit
Befo' you motherfuckers was even ready for it?
Showed you how to tie a flag on your head
And represent your motherfuckin set 'til you're dead
Bust on the cops while I cuss the Feds
Roll a joint, in the bathtub gettin head
Put the G in the P, flipped the G to a ki
Put the West coast back on the map bay-bee
Check my styles, check my files
I've been gangbangin since I was a juvenile
They cut me loose in nine-deuce I swore to tell the whole truth
Keep it gangbang 100 proof
E'rybody say, "Ay Snoop" - did Death Row pay me?
Look here young loc, shit it's all to the gravy
I really can't trip off the past, on the real I had a blast
2Pac, rest in peace and God bless all my enemies

Rain-drops, falling on my head
Fuckin with them haters, messin with my bread
Talkin bout the raindrops, fallin on my head
Fuckin with them haters, sleepin in my bed

Ain't No Limit to this shit, ain't no gimmick
Master P good lookin out homeboy, salute my Lieutenant (at ease)
I'm in it knee deep and can't creep no more
I had to move down South on the low-low, fo' sho' doe
Dippin through the woods with Fiend, Magic, Pokey
Mystikal, V-90, C, Boz and P (ya heard me?)
Windows on tint, ridin like the President
It's evident, shit I'm doin good (yeah)
I moved out the hood like I should (say what?)
And then they had the nerve to call me Hollywood (nigga what?)
But I don't give a fuck, if I'm misunderstood
20 Crip don't slip, yeah it's all to the good
Yeah the homies got twist too, whatchu say?
Oh the homies might get me? They'll get you
Listen here, don't try it, and don't deny it
And don't pay 'em no mind Dogg, man I'm tryin


Just when you thought I was gone, I'm back on
Knick-knack-paddy-wack give the Dogg a home
With a gang of pitbulls, rottweilers and doberman pinschers
Bonafied killers
The illest, cap peelers, that you ever wanna meet
Straight up out the ghetto where they pack the heavy metal
I got my hand on the wheel, my foot on the gas pedal
I'm drivin DoggHouse to the next level (woof)
And buckin two shots at the devil
Run up on his ass, and blast, like a rebel
Turn up the treble cause I hit you with the bass
Remember my name and remember my face
Remember these words, and remember the taste
And remember, we all gotta leave this place
I'm tryin to stay focused, I'm the loc'est in the game
The Rap Prime Minister, "Mr. G Thang"

Rain-drops, fallin on my head
Fuckin with the wrong folks, messin with my spread
Talkin bout the raindrops, fallin on my head
Messin with my ba-by, who's sleepin in my bed

6 ContributorsHigh School LyricsBonus track off the Mac & Devin Go to High School Soundtrack by rappers Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa.
Big Mac, big sack, like this, like that
Big man on campus, I'll be right back
Like Mike, like Mac, my life, my bike
Menace, mo' bid'ness, in the beginnin a po' student
But ended up bein a chemist
24/7, Devin my nigga committed
Classmates, ended up as my road dawg
I showed him how to live, how to ball 'til we fall
Harder it is, make you much smarter dawg
Follow instructions, changed up the dialogue
Manifest no stress, life is a big test
Will you fail? Or will you pass? Smoke grass, trim trees
Tryin to find some air to breathe
Miss her, please baby baby please
Diplomas, gowns, caps and degrees
These are necessities in life you need so I'ma get it
Focus, committed
15 years later, but yeah a nigga finally did it
Uh, now who's to say in life there's ups no downs?
And when you get up, you gotta get down
Uh, and when you get up, look around
And don't frown on the ones that's down - just give 'em a hand
It's like mixin fixin up pots and pans
Listen up, I'm poppin like rockin a band
No plan, all from the heart to the hand
We gon' roll it, smoke it and do it again
I'm the apprentice, back on my pimp shit
Roll it, puff it, now give it to him
Uh, physical fitness, smokin relentless
Nouns and pronouns, they make up my sentence
High school days, uh
Blowin on the purple haze, uh
High school days, uh
Blowin on the purple haze, uh (where you at Devin?)

And you know everywhere that we go
If it's Dev or it's Mac then we blowin by the O
Uhh, niggas know me for rollin the O-Z
Or somewhere low-key twistin a whole bush
And if I got it then you can get it, it's on us
Smoke so much pot that they'll probably give me my own kush
We blow about a zone, break it down blow it out a bone
Come to my crib I'll show you how to roll, bro
And my pocket's lookin kinda swole
Me and Mac smokin grade A, honor roll
Now all of the teachers on us
They gon' have contact cause I keep the bombest
Car automatic, don't need a key to start it
Know it's us just because of the weed aroma
Lookin for me nigga I'm in the tree department
With a doobie rolled up in the secret compartment
Tryin to finish up this speech and get my diploma
So I can get a crib where my OG can harvest and my niggas can ball
I'm talkin so much weed that the shit on the walls
If it start growin in the spring it gets picked in the fall
I'm used to goin to every class but I'm missin them all
Fuckin with Mac smokin spliffs in the halls singin this song
Like, niggas know me (know me)
Blowin on the OG (OG)
Niggas know me (know me)
Blowin on the OG (OG)

Niggas know me, hahaha

All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all...
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all...

Instructions to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open, focus, scoping out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
Cos I'm gon' make things get better for me
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea
We ride at high tide, the East is my side
Let me tell you 'long as my voice is recordable
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
Oh yes I'm fresh 'til i expire from existence
With persistence, I proceed
Supplying you with what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crystal
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me I'm tryin to keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

T Lee, hold 'em, shake 'em, roll
Fly G boys and all you hoodrat girls
Pound puts it down all around the world
The best pick out the litter, LB young nigga
I'll eat your soul out my dog bowl, I bark when it get dark
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?
On the microphone I bury the bone
Always, strays try to follow me home
Uhh, to get the pooper scooper, why? They droppin' doo-doo
I'm steppin' on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashin' full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got 'em waggin they tail
For the bow-wow LBC style
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want 'em close enough so I can lock on 'em
Wit the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on 'em
Check this out here man, I lick 'em, sick 'em
Man's best friend, I hit you for ten, uhh
Fleas can't seize my pack, what, what's my name?
Major trick we're hittin' licks like the Doberman Gang
Y'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG

Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
Weed out, DP'd out, GC'd out
Oh, did you not know
Snoop wit the .44 knockin at'cha door
We the passion for smashin and mashin the masses
Knockin' niggas like Cassius, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
Cos for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin
Bustin, no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone
Free the D-O-double G with the solid gold bone

Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

You MUST act fast!
 + (Snoop)
Holy mackerel Batman! I think these clowns need a back hand
Let's be the Gap Band and drop the bomb on 'em and make 'em SCAT man
(When you say scat man, like the Brother Cuh-rothers?) Uh-huh
(When it's on, it's cold, so bring the coroner cover)
We can take it to the Bassment, live with Tigger
Go get The Riddler, and watch me play that nigga like a fiddler
On a hot tin roof, I got them watchin who?
She who spits it like she was sippin rot-ten brew, ooh
(We Marvel at you Comics, you ain't no Superhero)
You just a stupid zero, you ain't hard like DeNiro

 + (Rage)
Surprise! The Dynamic Duo
Batman & Robin, gats set for squabbin (nigga!)
Splat! Hit 'em like forty-five shells (nigga!)
Plaque! Means more than one million sales (huh)
That's nuff shot to lick, you get done up
Plus we got the Bat gats, so why would you run up? (huh)
"Batman! Batman! Batman."
{*scratched: "And you're about to find out"*}

{*scratched: "And you're about to find out"*}

Yeah, when it's beef in Gotham City I, gots to flip and
Hit 'em with the POW! BAM! BIFF! Whoa
Pick up your lips, don't trip, tie your shoelace
When I spit, I split it, turn Harvey Dent into Two-Face
Robin, I'm more than a sidekick, I'm more like the livest
They wanna go head up and collide
And like collision, hope your moms made provisions
See you ain't got no ends baby, not even a smidgen
Mad hostility dealt, now I'mma really be felt
Switch on my utility belt, make yo' facility melt
I go Mad on yo' Hatter, watch yo' whole shit splatter
Get, wicked on yo' case like Detective Van Adder
So the, sayin goes, if you snooze you lose
Trust you do, me and Batman the Dynamic Two!


Cold day in Gotham in the Bat Cave chillin
Catnip for Catwoman so she caught the feeling
Huh, talk about flavor for a Pringle
A favor for a favor maybe later we can mingle
Damn, just then, the Bat Phone ringin
They hoo-bangin' in Gotham, I got to do my thing

Batman! War is on the brink
It seems that the Penguin is causing a stink
Call up Robin quick, you know what to do
Add dye to the water and splash the town blue

Shit I'm there in a flash, Batmobile on 3's
Trust me buddy, got heat for Mr. Freeze
And Clayface will catch the em-brace
Of napalm when I drop my Bat Bomb
.. and don't you forget it
Takin out you suckers and you don't know how I did it

No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime
No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime

Dirty Dinkins Batman!
Did you see those crispy khaki creases on that rugged wretched..

Aiy-yo-yo-yo kick back Robin
Get Alfred and tell him to have barbecued buffalo wings
And a pitcher of Kool-Aid on chill
It's about to get real in the field

Leapin Lo-lo's! Over there Batman! That's a no-no!
Let's hop out this fo'-do'!

Yea yea yea, systems engaged
Start the Bat Engine, hit the Bat Switches
You ready Robin? Let's dip

Let's, dip! Holy Hoodrat Sally smokin' crack in the alley
Let's, dip! I mean, crazy kinfolk in Kingsville Batman!
We must, we MUST Batman, listen to me
Holy Leapin Lizards and Gizzards and all that shit that come with it
And potatoes on top with gravy in the middle
God damnit Batman! {*echoes*}
"Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da--da-da-dah - BATMAN!!"

17 ContributorsI Get Lifted LyricsTrack #2 off the Mac & Devin Go to High School Soundtrack by rappers Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa.
Snoop and Wiz get high everyday.
Good morning nifnods and stoners
I would like to welcome you to Nathaniel L. High School
The home of the scholars
The home of the impalas
And the home of the rottweilers
I'm your counselors, Warren G

I'm just; soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
I get lifted, I get lifted (Everyday)
I get lifted, I get lifted
I get lifted, I get lifted (Everyday)
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey

Overzel me, propel me, propeller, cat pilla
Rap healer, dope dealer, grip it back
Lick it back now, reseller
Exhale, inhaler, feller, Juicys pored
Dueces for all you loud mouth bitches who adore
I can't play on your field anymore
Take it flight, now look at me soar
In and out of space with my foot to the floor
Higher and higher, I won't retire
Halfie don Kaya, Love smokin fire tata like satellite
All on the wire
Keep it up, speed it up, slow it up
Throw it up
Your bitch is looking at me cause she probably wanna go with us
It's cool with me, hop in, hop in, ain't no stopping
We keep knocking, rocking

I'm just; soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
I get lifted, I get lifted (Everyday)
I get lifted, I get lifted
I get lifted, I get lifted (Everyday)
I get lifted, I get lifted, hey

Dimes, dubs, quarter ounce oz, put it in a zag
Let it burn slowly everywhere I am
Nigga got blow tree rolling every gram
They be like holy smokes, that man no joke
Can tell if it's that "mehh" (crap) if you don't choke
Never gonna quit, every chance I'm a toke
Zips smelling like the whole plants in my coat
For autographs, coming at me with all the names
And what I gotta have
I got my own shit, and this ain't for the little kid
This grown shit, having a party at my crib
Bring your own bitch, I got 3, so matter of fact you can take one
And roll a joint baby girl let's bake one
And take this weed and I can show you how to make one, uh

I'm just; soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
(Yeah, niggas know I get lifted man it's high school man)
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need
(I stay high, I mean I don't gotta get high I'm already there)
Smoking on this weed, this is all I need

I get lifted, I get lifted (Everyday)

Guerilla millionaires, so don't even ask, if you wanna
Get to clappin, soldier action specialty of style
We made the whole world respect the underground while
Some of y'all niggas talk shit and get mad
Cause we did it with a foot up your ass, and it's still there (Sho!)
I cares not about your click or the block
I'm still that same bitch to run up in your spot and knock you off
Broad, with the cause, (yeah) bitch on a mission (Uh-huh)
Keep them niggas by they nuts while you hoes be dick-kissing
Missin the game, damn bitch it's written in plain ebonics
So shake that come-up off you brain and do the knowledge
Mia X (Mama Mia!), kickin off the ghetto symphony
Next soldier up, tell em who the FUCK you be
WHUT? It's Fiend y'all

Put me in the ring with real MC's, and watch em run for cover
And hidin in trees, to escape the mic that I breathe on
Bleed on, exceed on!
Weak rappers with titles after twelve (Ding!)
Hit a bell that's what I'll feed on!
Microphone Don, walkin flesh, talkin bomb
Bringin harm, to the calm, and, come be alarmed
It's the African, oh, you wanna battle again?
I'll turn, you and your mans, to my yesterday plans
Oh, damn! Toting two pistols like Yosemite Sam
Oh, man, he grand! Loud as the Southern band
Pickups and caravans, the soldier, that could, that can
I would be the man, but God beat me to them plans

Next up, on the M-I-C

You know when you got a motherfuckin hit? (When?)
Bitch? When it sound like this! (Hahaha)

And try to bust a rhyme at this clip

I feel so fuckin' gorgeous
Don't this shit look gorgeous?
Under the skies, stars in your eyes
This is euphoric (Yeah, baby, come on)
We can be anything, this is everything
We do the wildest things 'til six in the mornin'
Yeah, bitch, this the feelin'

Last time I checked
I was the plug to your plug, I'm the fucking connect
What you expect? Negotiate and never settle for less
I never lose, always winnin' when I shuffle a deck
Droppin' these jewels, where I'm from, you better treasure your chest
You know the rules, plus one, she always come with a guest
She in the pool, best believe I plan on makin' her wet
Give her the blues, back up in this bitch and get in my reps
Show you how to do it properly when you on my property
I'm a hot commodity, Boardwalk, Monopoly
A nigga safe ran out of space, I'm a odyssey
Honestly, I'm that motherfucker that you gotta see

I feel so fuckin' gorgeous
Don't this shit look gorgeous?
Under the skies, stars in your eyes
This is euphoric (Yeah, baby, come on)
We can be anything, this is everything
We do the wildest things 'til six in the mornin'
Yeah, bitch, this the feelin'

Now, woah, woah, woah, woah
Now that's a lotta ass in the passenger seat
Drop it low, low, low, low
Yeah, 'bout to hit a switch in this bitch, watch the '64 roll
I dealt with the cons and the pros
I mix Crip shit with the highs and the lows
Picture this, bitch, withdrawin' the bankroll
It's just some Dogg food for the soulless
Criminal psychology, this shit just a part of me
Industrial robbery, a product of '93 (Yeah)
Follow me, follow me, I'm where the dollars be
My stock up, nigga, no return on this policy

I feel so fuckin' gorgeous
Don't this shit look gorgeous?
Under the skies, stars in your eyes
This is euphoric (Yeah, baby, come on)
We can be anything, this is everything
We do the wildest things 'til six in the mornin'
Yeah, bitch, this the feelin'

Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
"Never Leave Me Alone", "Ain't No Fun", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish rope with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, "Baby please, you out here serving stress"
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these

She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his Stars untied
And a blue and grey cap that said "The Eastside"
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said, "He would grow up to be nothing but a gangster"
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
(scratching) And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said "Sorry, Warren G, but there's no help wanted"
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like "Warren, welcome to my store"
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, "Can I be down champ?"
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
"Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to see Daz back in the day"
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

You caught the vapors
You caught the vapors

[Song 119: On TDE: “They’re Not Death Row”]
19 ContributorsOn TDE: “They’re Not Death Row” Lyrics“Snoop Dogg – aka Snoopzilla currently for his 7 Days of Funk collaboration with Dam-Funk – was surprised by GQ’s comparison of TDE to Death Row Records. "They said what?” was Snoop’s initial reaction when… Read More No, they're not the new Death Row
Because TDE did it completely different than Death Row did it. Death Row did it with a gangster approach. We...we were smashin on niggas, we was fuckin people up. We was..determined to be the hardest, meanest, baddest, coldest, roughest toughest in the game. That was our mission. Uhh..TDE. Rappers. They're peaceful, they love, they get down. They got rappers from everywhere and they represent hip-hop and they don't represent negativity and violence. And tryin to mash and disrespect it. So it's like, that how Death row came.. We came out disrespectin' Eazy E and anyone who had a problem with Dr. Dre.
That was our first get down. It was "fuck dem niggas up first". That's not TDE mentality. Their mentality is cool with everybody. Kendrick Lamar flipped out on everybody. That's that Death Row influence, that may have cause him to backslide and feel a certain way. Which I support fully and his thoughts in what he said...Cause I'm from the West Coast, fuck errbody who got a problem with it.
But I don't feel like TDE and Death Row are the same thing in any way. I feel like Death Row paved the way for TDE...To do it in their own way... So they can stay around 20 years from now.

Can ya dig that?

Baby girl, we rock the party

It takes a whole lot to be number one
I can't walk down the street without my gun
I can't trust these niggas, fool, It ain't no fun
I'm sittin' up in court 'cause somebody got dumb
What really counts is how the crowd bounce
Go home and say "Snoop rocked the party"
Nobody got killed is what got announced
I guess they got a chance to see Dr. Bombay
But I keep my heat in case niggas get cold
Warm you up with the sheet
Zip you up and roll
Now, Doggystyle Records is now official
Gettin' money at the Pliz-ate with my initials
Shippin' records overseas, I'm makin' G's
With who you may call enemies
But I see nothing funny about makin' money
'Cause, uh, we all know it don't grow on trees
So I gotta get what I gotta get when I can
Up early in the mornin' wit' the Gap Band
Burning rubber down to get a new car
So don't get jealous when you see me in the Double R

Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head

Ay, Snoop, you ready?
Ay, Doc, I been ready
Whoo, ah, yeah
Whoo, ah, yeah

Thank you for letting me be myself again
Can we get high ay yai yai yai? Please excuse me while I kiss the sky
Thank you for letting me be myself again
Can we get high ay yai yai yai? Please excuse me while I kiss the sky

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
Times are changing, young niggas is dangerous
Rich and shameless, do anything to be famous
If you talking 'bout this crippin', then you speaking my language
This how you do waking up with the world under you
I'm rolling blunts, fucked up, it's so comfortable
I'm revving up my revenue, I'm unavailable
Somewhere in Malibu, somehow I made it off the avenue
Once upon a time the Dogg went through it all
Withdrawals and breaking laws, the streets under my paws
In the field, ducking cells, close calls
We big whales, got fish scales, that's snow fall (Hold up)
Shit, I'd like to thank me
And if we talking 'bout the West, nigga, thank me
Walk of Fame made a name, better thank me
Ain't nothing new, this is what I'm born to do, I just wanna say

Thank you for letting me be myself again
Can we get high ay yai yai yai? Please excuse me while I kiss the sky
Thank you for letting me be myself again
Can we get high ay yai yai yai? Please excuse me while I kiss the sky

Now you go fuck around and find out (Find out)
I think you niggas need to take a time out (Time out)
Might have to leave her a dose of me on the upholstery
High level potency, better than dopamine
You fucking with a winner winner (Winner)
Shit, it's been a minute since we went up (Nigga, we been up)
Now with six million ways to get it, choose one
Snoop Dogg, look how I did it, Hell of a run
Income, tick-tick-bomb, remain calm
Dropping napalm, I'm in here with both guns
How I made mine, click-click-boom, it's showtime
Nigga, these days I'm throwing money like gang signs (Crip)
Look, now I ain't felt this gangster in a minute (In a minute)
All on your television, cleaning up my image (Cleaning up my image)
When shit get heavy, you know a nigga push the limits
Locking up on every corner, I'm just here and wanna

Thank you for letting me be myself again
Can we get high ay yai yai yai? Please excuse me while I kiss the sky
Thank you for letting me be myself again

Ayy, man, it's DPG up in this motherfucker, man
And we only in town for a day or two
So we tryna find some motherfuckin' hoes
Man, do anybody know where the hoes at?
I mean, I'm tryna find a bad ho' for my nigga over there
I'm tryna find a light-skinned ho' for my nigga right there
And my nigga right here, he want a chocolate bitch
We just wanted some hoes

Where the hoes, where the hoes, where the hoes at? (Where they at?)
My nigga, Daz, do you know where the hoes at? (Where they at?)
Ayy, Soopafly, can you tell me where the hoes at? (Where they at?)
Ayy, Loc, Loc, do you know where the hoes at? (Where they at?)
Where the hoes, where the motherfuckin' hoes at? (Where they at?)
Ayy, Davie G, do you know where the hoes at? (Where they at?)
Anybody, do you know where the hoes at? (Where they at?)
I'm tryna find me a little fly hood rat
Look for the hoes, tryna find the hoes (What, what, what, what?)
Cute little hoes, I'm the dick-banger, bro (What, what, what, what?)

I step into the club, see them hoes with the big butts
Is it me or you or these hoes wanna fuck?
Get the fuck up and get your ass off the road
Put these beez-alls in your jeez-alls and suck on my dog
All of y'all know what time it is
P up in this, some shed a tear, now get the fuck out of here
We got weed, hoes, drink, and bank
Fuck the police, nigga, pledge with the tank
Crank the music up a little louder
Watch these bitches and these hoes get a little wilder
Put your hands in the air, you down for the get-down
Super Daz and Snoop Dogg, nigga, the motherfuckin' Dogg Pound
Ladies love Daz when they're lickin' their lips (Lips)
The same way your ho', she be lickin' my dick
Because bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
They lick on the lefts and they— (Suck a dick)

Where the hoes, where the hoes, where the hoes at? (Where they at?)

I'm tryna find me a little fly hood rat
Look for the hoes, shoot for the ho' (What, what, what, what?)
Thick-ass bitch, suck the dick by the bro (What, what, what, what?)

They super mashin' on these bitches, like Idaho potatoes
Fuck a boujee broad, fly, lookin' for them stank holes
Suck me, super mold a bitch out of play-dough
I keep a ho' in check, I'm best with your bankroll
Throw your hands up, your backstage and your man's stuck
Shake that shit, like your ass throwin' a tantrum
Fuck a bitch, suck a dick, it's an anthem
Hit it, pass 'em, talk shit and I trash 'em
I'm kind of diggin' this ho' right here
I wanna stick my dick in this ho' right here
Pussy soft, just like some chinchilla fur
Ask me in the mornin' and the whole thing's a blur
Where them hoes at? No squares, where the pro's at?
Here's my ballsack, you can sport it, like a throwback
One for the money (Money), two for my hoes (Hoes)
Three D.P.G.'s, we pimpin', bitch, please

Where the hoes, where the hoes, where the hoes at? (Where they at?)
My nigga, Daz, do you know where the hoes at? (Where they at?)
Ayy, Soopafly, can you tell me where the hoes at? (Where they at?)
Ayy, Loc, Loc, do you know where the hoes at? (Where they at?)

Dududududu

The revolution, oh, oh

Sitting back watching, but I'm so unstable
I been an OG since I was rockin' in the cradle
Y'all don't know that my bite is so fatal
Kick a fool down like the homie with the 8-0
Ayy though, nigga don't play though
With the 'K though, like the spray though
Sculpted left hand full of clay dough
Split him in the middle cut him up like a potato
Oh, leave 'em on the sideline, bleeding cause he tried mine
We loot 'til the boot out
Me and my brother, we was caught up in a shootout
Had to handle, pigs on a nigga, four days
Eight laws of power, eighty-five ways
TEC-9's with a couple 45's
And the revolution will be televised

The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)

This ain't the local pass cash with the bra fast views
This shit will be viewed on your broadcast news
Why did I do it? My momma is on the call
Shot three lil pigs and now my back against the wall
Nowhere to turn and nowhere to go
My blood is burnin' I'm about to blow
Huey, Malcolm and Martin, those are my peers
They been doin' niggas like this for over hundreds of years
Poppin' us, fear, now it's time for us to clap back
But this time we gon' bust, step the fuck back
We ain't runnin', we shootin' and lookin' forward
Anybody, somebody, everybody on the floor
They just surrounded my place
Hold the court in the streets so I can win my case
TEC-9's with a couple 45's
And the revolution will be televised

The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)
The revolution, oh, oh

[Song 125: Crip Ya Enthusiasm]
26 ContributorsCrip Ya Enthusiasm Lyrics
Another episode of a Doggy Dogg tale, you know me well
You know I'm coming by the smell
I’m here when you see the weed smoke in the air
Party people, wave your hands like you just don't care
Crip your enthusiasm

Mm, pen and paper, money maker, let the beat ride
Let me put you up on this nigga from the east side
This nigga born ready, serve a nigga ether
With the pen or off the heady, this nigga flow is dеadly (Where he at?)
Right hеre, Snoop Dogg, I'm with the G Child
Play something, let me fuck you up just with this freestyle (That’s dope)
For sure, but let's make a real record with real effort
'Cause my pen game is lethal cyanide mixed with ether
Spittin' nothin' but them hits out
The Chronic put the world up on this shit Snoopy been about
I wrote it down, needed backup, called the hounds
I'm worldwide, you know the voice, you know the sound (Ha-ha)
Paint it like Picasso, my spot on top of the charts
You ain't fuckin' with the Dogg, I do this shit every day
I don’t play with this here, just look at my resume
I’m probably Pimp of the Year, that's what all the players say
My smooth tone, reppin’ for the blue zone
Crip shit, for niggas to get they groove on (Hey)
I tell my street life glory in a east side story
I got that Hall of Fame pen game, nigga, ain't shit changed
Still leave you niggas assed out like Ving Rhames
Ever since I started, I've been all about big things
Crip it, curve it, flip it and serve it
I'm at your service so don’t get nervous

These are words coming from the Dogg
And everything I do is lit (Yes, sir)
Hoppin' right along, tryna get my party on
Call my nigga (Leon Black), let's go bust a bitch (Mm)

La-di-da-di, Snoopy's in the party
Smokin' that yessir, the best served, that's good for everybody
It's some players in the house, if you see 'em, point 'em out
Pulled up in that Bentley with my nigga Leon Black with me
That's simply two layers of mackin' on you bitches
Like true players (But I'm here with my baby daddy), bitch, who cares?
We came to make the party crack, no games
I'm in the party strapped, Snoop Dogg and Black, now, where the party at?
Pop that champagne bottle, we goin' up full throttle
Don't matter, wherever Snoopy go, these hoes gon' follow
Glasses up, we toastin', Backwoods I'm smokin'
V.I.P., I'm posted, eeny-meeny-miney
You know where to find me
With a cute-faced bitch, big ass and waist tiny
I got 'em lined up like tic-tac-toe, that's three in a row
An exotic bitch, a snow bunny and me and your ho
We all up in the club livin' our best life
Black gave a nigga thumbs, nigga like, "That's right"
Hit the dance floor with some twins, they was close friends
Back that ass up, she said, "Grab it with both hands"
Now players do what players do
You know the Dogg, no sugar-coatin', I speak the truth
I make the rules, grip it, curve it, flip it and serve it
I'm at your service, now, don't get nervous

Another episode of a Doggy Dogg tale, you know me well
You know I'm coming by the smell
I'm here when you see the weed smoke in the air
Party people, wave your hands like you just don't care
Crip your enthusiasm

Yeah, say what?
Crip your enthusiasm
Okay, like that?
Say what, say what?
Crip your enthusiasm
Uh, like this?
Yeah, Crip your enthusiasm
Uh

Real nigga shit...
Now I'm 'bout to show you how the West Coast rock
Real nigga shit
Now I'm 'bout to show you how the West Coast rock
Real nigga shit...

Here come The Villain again, grab your ho and get the fuck outta town
This nigga shit make the world go round
It's that Black nigga Ren, duck when I bust
Make Jada get on these nuts, make Will love to cuss
You wanna fuck with us? Man, I wouldn't do it
Ask this nigga here – his ass, we ran right through it
You out actin' like yo' shit be tight
Get some shit, fuck it off like Tomica Wright
Get the fuck out my sight, I Ren-incarnate
Droppin' West Coast shit in every motherfuckin' state
Motherfuckin' legend, y'all niggas be knowin'
You can leave yo' bitch, and keep on goin'

I am Doggy Dogg, bitch (Beitch) – love to hit a switch
Never hit a bitch (Geitch) – love that gangsta shit
"Can I hear your flow?" Can I fuck yo' ho?
"Boy, you hard on 'em" Nigga, you ain't know?
When you testify, you got to keep it fly
A lot of niggas lie, shit – we do or die
E'ryday we high, it's like a 9 to 5
I got my nina, my fo'-heata, beata by my side
I keep it tucked close when I'm on the West Coast (West Coast)
I keep it on post when I'm with my East Coast folks, locs (East Coast)
Y'all know what's crack-a-lackin'
I'm from the hood of the drive-bys, and kidnappings, and car-jackings

Me and Snoop Dogg on the hog
On our way to the mall, fuck alla y'all
We gon' ball 'til we fall, watch the chrome crawl
Intercept these fine bitches, 'cause we want 'em all
Droppin' drawers, poppin' coochie, and lickin' balls
Only gangsta ass nigga follow nigga laws
Only gangsta ass bitches get to run the hogs
Only real ass niggas get to set it off

Now, the way I gets off in that ass, it's a sin to not assassin
Grab a microphone, have flashbacks, and start flashin' – ahh
I'm bound to toast ya
String you up, like you was on the Ponderosa
Sip on Mimosa, do it that way, 'cause I'm supposed ta
Now most of ya, don't measure up
I'll make it hot and turn the pressure up – steamin'
Regular? Nah, supreme
And I–ain't gassed
I blow an MC away, like Fox, when I pass
Ain't nothin' shitty about this here, fuck around and that's that ass
Just like grass I – I want more Green than the Goblin
Matter of fact, I want more Bank than that chick that be modelin' (UHH!)
My uzi weighs more than a single ton
I leave you single, son
Who wanna mingle? Not a single one
Hah, now tell me what you figure, nigga?
Rob load up the show, slow flow spitter
The hard hitter (UHH), the R, nigga, roll
I break it down sweet, then I bring it back slow

Me and Snoop Dogg on the hog
On our way to the mall, fuck alla y'all
We gon' ball 'til we fall, watch the chrome crawl
Intercept these fine bitches, 'cause we want 'em all
Droppin' drawers, poppin' coochie, and lickin' balls
Only gangsta ass nigga follow nigga laws
Only gangsta ass bitches get to run the hogs
Only real ass niggas get to set it off

Nigga, that was dumb-diggy-diggy-dumb dumb
Here them niggas come-kiddy-kiddy-come come
I think a nigga sprung-spriggy-spriggy-sprung sprung
Probably why he done-diggy-diggy-done done
Yo' lady think I'm cute, I be knockin' her boots
When she's away from home, she be swallowin' juice
You thinkin' that's yo' son, but he ain't lookin' like you
See the barrel of a gun – nigga, whatcha gon' do?
Set it off

Niggas pop mo' shit, while we drop mo' shit
Continously, nigga, nigga please
Slang yo' ki's, birdies and trees
You can catch me and my niggas, overseas
Shootin' the breeze, with a cute Vietnamese
Or was she Lebanese? I think she Chinese
It really don't matter, 'cause they all on they knees
It's somethin' 'bout these motherfuckin' West Coast G's
Make that cheese, when the cops come, you bet' not freeze
Blast on 'em like the Genovese, they yo' enemies
Lock you up and fuck you up
Talk shit to you, beat you down, then cuff you up
And leave you in a cell stuck (Damn!)
I ain't got no money for bail, that's real as fuck (F'real)
Tryin' to get a meal ticket and kick it
Chill, catch a plane to Spain, or maybe Brazil
On the real, can you feel me?

Yeah, yeah, set it off
It's Kurupt Young Gotti
Doin' it big, for all y'all suckers
We set it off, Snoop Dogg!
It's 'Tha Last Meal'!
Last time y'all suckers gon' eat off my big homeboy
We set it off!
We set it off! West Coast   

[Song 127: Bring It On]
16 ContributorsBring It On Lyrics
In these times, of hate and pain
We need a remedy, to help us through the rain
Can't you see? I'm straight O.G. (O.G.)
Fuck you niggas, think you can fuck with me?

Oh c'mon
Make a pimp wanna jump back
Bitch, and fuck that
Shit, I'm qualified to knock a hoe, no matter wherever I go
Excuse me, partner, this the pimpin', let a pimp in pimpin' let you go
Break the bitch, you say "I will"
Tryin' to break the bitch, but you saying "I will"
Then, nigga – shit, since you put it like that
I'm about to lace 'em right now, nigga
And take them straight to the track (Track)
I've never let a bitch pimp me
Trying to tell me what to do, but I'ma stay O.G. 
Fresh out the pen, only 32 days (32 days)
And I added and subtracted in a multiplied way
Now, switch worlds –
Why did the little girl walk around with a gold fish in her pocket?
So she could smell like the big girls
And check the one with the fast mouth
Just get your money, even if you have to knock her motherfuckin' ass out

I don't care whatcha do
Long as you don't fuck with mine (C'mon, sing it, ya'll)
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time

Ol' "Blue Eyes," Dogg Sinatra
Make a nigga disappear like Jimmy Hoffa (Where is he?)
The Glock cocker, hoe hopper, show stopper
Watch your mouth, watch your mouth
I'll put you in a brick in a building
And separate you from your children ("Daddy!")
I stay G'd up
All the G's from my set ain't never PC'd up (Hahaha)
If you hit the main line, you gonna get stomped
Paying motherfuckers off – you's a sucka duck
Me and my niggas go hard in the paint
Puttin' paint where it ain't, makin' bitch niggas faint
It's a clear blue sky here on the Eastside (Eastside)
Throw your set up, and wave it from (Rolling) side to C-side
I'm talking big shit, holdin' my dick
Banging on you, cuz – nigga, this Crip

I got so many tricks up my sleeve (Oh y'all ain't knowin')
For you hoes to disbelieve (Hoes in amazement)
You wanna bang, let's bring it on (Oh oh)
We's about a thousand niggas strong

I don't care whatcha you do (I don't care what the fuck whatcha do)
Long as you don't fuck with mine (As long you don't fuck with mine)
You think you can't be touched (Uhhhhh)
Niggas disappear all the time

No, I don't love you bitch, you a hoe, I never will (Never will)
Can't tell you my feelings ,'cause the pimpin' don't feel
Bitch, matter' fact – be gone
Fuck around and have your mama saying "Baby, he wrong!"
"Talking about he a real pimp..."
Bitch – is gumbo laced with the proper crop of jumbo shrimp?!
Stepped out the pen with my hoe, got it crackin' with my hoe
Steady mackin' with my hoe, now I'm stackin' with my hoe

I pop a bottle of Mo'
About to model a hoe
I'm working them, serving 'em and breaking 'em off (You know)
Did the weed man get here? Taking too long
But when he get here, dog
I'm taking a zone (Give it up, nigga)
Niggas know how D-O-double-G doo's it
Known for making that Crip Hop music, don't abuse it
Just ride to the rhythm of a pimp ass, upper class, cold motherfucker

{*humming*} Long you don't fuck with mine
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time {*humming*}

Admit it, I'm the best dog/doe
Just cause we rich trick
Always so fresh doe

Then hang up in your face
Unless I'm getting sprayed

I'll take my cake to go
Happy birthday

Wanna do it your way?

Oh you know you're  one
Until she almost bust a vessel

Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

Some do the things that they do 'cause they dumb
And some do the things that they do for crumbs
I do mine for me ya see?
Not the big homey double O-G
Scared to do your own work, man that's foul
And that's the reason why I had to shoot you down
Because you never should've tried to work my Dogg
And the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump
Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'
Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!
Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er
Few many times too many and became a teller
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em
But they won't sell you the game to get up on em
Ya tryin' ta find em 'cause you want em, they shook out
Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out
It ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga
But it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us
But instead, you put it in their head
That at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)

Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

Ayo Snoop, why when niggas get into the bracket
Of makin' loot, niggas wan' trip
Spittin' like you 'spose to be from the hood
Show me love nigga or don't show me shit
Feel the fever, million dollar man like Colt Seavers
Made a non-believing man into a believer
Receive a check the next day, my homies say
This the way to get paid, DP's invade
I don't know why you wanna get on my back? (Why?)
Trippin' 'cause you know the bomb's at where I'm at
Well if that's the case you shoulda rolled
Wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)
This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue
Me, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop
Niggas from sets be tryin' to set you up 'cause you set in your ways
So ask DJ Pooh what pays

Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

Just what we need, bangin' on wax, another Crip
(What's up, cuz?)
What you gon' do nigga, jack the mothership?
You're like a actor wit another script
Predictable as Rambo wit another clip (busta)
How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?
You need to sit down and learn to get down first
'Cause, uhh, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers
Not part-time FBI singers
Niggas having bad intentions, sending BG's on a mission
One move too many, nigga you missin'
Listen, you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no
Loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D
Niggas got too flossy from all the sacs they tossin'
And guess what it cost me, they crossed me
But before I give a nigga a 9
I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme

Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
They say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG
Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang
And if I'm bangin' it's with DPG

[Song 130: Sixx Minutes]
16 ContributorsSixx Minutes LyricsThe 14th track on Snoop Dogg’s second studio album and his last on death row records Tha Doggfather.
The song samples “The Show” by Doug E Fresh.
Yeah yeah yeah, make some motherfuckin' noise
Yo Doggy Dogg you're on, live on stage
Performing tonight
(Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on)
You know! The one and only
Don Corleone
The big homey, y'know me

Well if it's on, then I guess it's 'bout time
Let me slide into this OG rhyme
I do mine the way I do mine
And I takes my time when I'm droppin' my lines
I look around, I spot MC's (and they)
All in the place (and they) all wannabe's
Tryin' to make their paper, tryin' to do they thang
But to me they all tryin' to say the same thang
How could you rap over beats that whack?
You ain't reachin' the crowd, you ain't makin' your fact
You ain't droppin' lines that hit the top
You can't make the party go hip-hop
And you can't do your thing without using mine
We get and steal, I see you're on the grind
But I'ma take my time to get my point across
And if you get caught up in the rap shit then got lost
And if you get tossed it's on your own, it's your own fault
See I gots ta get mine, I don't try no song
I just move on, groove on, try to prove on
Then I do mines to do mines and I'mma keep on, keep on, keep on
To get'cha you in a... .smooth type of atmosphere
Sit back and pay attention yeah
You ain't never heard it like that
Uhh, is that right? That's right black
But uhh

Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes, Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on
Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on

I gets my hair whipped on Friday, my day, why they
Even trippin' on me? Yeah the big homey
Gamey Gamey says "Snoop Corleone
Listen to me man, stay away from them phonies
It's niggas like that that get you caught up quick
You gots ta stay focussed Dogg, keep your eye on your grip
Cos if you slip they gon' getcha and they gon' getcha fast
These niggas out for your money man, they tryna get your cash"
I don't give a damn, you gots ta match
You can be from the East Coast and get love cos I ain't trippin' on your ass
I don't smash on niggas who are smaller than me
I smash on niggas who big like the DPGC
Oohwee, I getcha crazy
You gots ta have a stomach for this shit, baby
And if ya don't you won't, you fake the funk
See Snoop is the G in the G-Funk
Now don't do nuttin' that you can't get out of
Uh uh, you know I got big love for the real G's
We make mo' G's, I gots ta have it

Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes, Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on
Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on

I got the, I got the, I got the paper
I keep ya, I keep ya, I keep ya cryin
I thought ya, I thought ya knew my nigga
Ya better, ya better ask somebody (Better ask somebody)

Uh, it don't quit
Now let me take my time and just get into the shit
I'm just driftin', so swift and smooth
How many niggas make the whole party move like I do?
I can't name nobody
So sit back relax and let the Dogg rock the party
Ain't no party like a DP party
Cos everybody in the DP party's naughty
They acts a fool, old school, new school
Everything is everything, everybody playin' cool
Ain't no set trippin', everybody just dippin'
Bitches gettin' with niggas and niggas gettin' bitches
It's all superb, word to my momma
Ain't no drama, no need for that
You can put your gat back in' your pocket
Unlock it cos Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I plan to rock it
Don't stop, (excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on)

Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)
Six minutes, Doggy Dogg you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on
Excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on
Six minutes (six minutes), six minutes (six minutes)

DPG – is down with us
X to the Z – is down with us
D-R-E – is down with us
My nigga Kokane – is down with us
Eastside gang – is down with us
Niggas talkin' shit, I'm gettin ready to bust
I'm number 1 (One, one, one...)
With a bullet motherfuckers

I got this Henn in my cup
And this Buddah got me stuck
I'm just trying to compose myself (Compose myself)
I don't know why I act this way
I just wanna be left alone
I'm just trying to enjoy myself (Enjoy myself)

Aww naw (Who is it?)
It's motherfuckin' Snoop Dogg
I live the fast life, while ya keep ya cash tight
In broad daylight, walkin' wit ya flashlight
Addin' up what ya brought in from last night
She mad tight, with mad bite (Is that right?)
Bad lil' bitches on my tizz-eam (Tizz-eam)
Nigga, that's the American drizz-eam (Wha-wha-wha-what?)
Pussy broke the President (Yeah it did)
And pussy made a pimp rich (Yeah it did)
I live like I'm both ,as I smoke on my dope
On my boat, thumbin' through C-notes
Now here's a toast to the coast
'Cause we doin' it the most (We doin' it the most)
Playa playa, high costs
Uno, dos, I'm 'bout to get ghost

Stackin' what ya mackin', D-O-double-G
The shit ya doin' is so lovely
The haters hate 'cause they will never be
There ain't no limit to this melody (Melody)
You niggas sippin' on that jealousy (Jealousy)
I pour a tall glass of Hennesey (Want some?)
Do you wanna have a sip with me?
Or would you rather try and trip with me? (Trip with me?)
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side, that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
'Cause we came here to have a good time
Me and my niggas in the sunshine (Sunshine)
On 3 wheels with one 9 (Ya know)
It's time to shine, the world is mine (The world is mine)

I never ever dropped a dime (Shiiit)
Nigga might cop a dime
Never hesitate to pop a 9 (Bah!)
And always come up with the proper line
Stick to the script, bitch, I'm hurtin' shit (Hurtin' shit)
Let me show you motherfuckers what I'm workin' with
(What you workin with?)
Don't need no water to go with your order
And you ain't got to smuggle the shit up over the border
Affordable, sportable, unbelievable, feasible, and reasonable
We leavin' 'em low
'Cause me and my loc, keep big leaves of smoke
Gallons of Hennesey and 16 liters of Coke
He done drank and she done smoked
The meters are broke, we put the V to the note
I brought the weed to smoke
And Dr. Dre, he hooked the beat up, indeed it was dope

Stackin' what ya mackin', D-O-double-G
The shit ya doin' is so lovely
The haters hate 'cause they will never be
There ain't no limit to this melody (Melody)
You niggas sippin' on that jealousy (Jealousy)
I pour a tall glass of Hennesey (Hennesey)
Do you wanna have a sip with me? (Sip with me?)
Or would you rather try and trip with me? (Trip with me?)
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side, that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker, acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up

Some of that hood shit
Coming up
How that sound ?
I've been doing this shit since day one
Yeah nigga, day one, day one yeah
Let me, let me tell you what your worth is
Wake up in the mornin with a purpose
Only you can make me happy, surface
East side long beach baby, the turf shit
The place where I lurked at
13 on the scene getting bent back
With a whole lotta snake venom
Used to steal annihilators out the highway center
Up early getting shit started
Back flippin', trippin', tippin', Crippin' cold hearted
Way before I got high man
Both double up 15s from the pie man
Heat out the motherfucking frying pan
Little kids love Snoop, fuck IronMan
I'm a vet on the set I ain't lyin man
Let me show you how fly I am
Play in the school, lay in the pool
And I stay in the cool
Young loc I ain't playin with fools
Reset, repeat
Unlock and recock
The heat and it gets so fast
Spend yo cash
It will get in yo ass
Now the question is this for now
Are you really in love with that bitch yo?
Another man's trash is another man's treasure
What's your pleasure?
Looking at you straight from a falcon eye
On my balcony, asking how can I?

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me
Curr I used to run with struck out gon' away
Cold things is he called me on the phone today
Told me he was up for release
Its been about a dub since cuz seen the streets
Yeah loc, shit don' change
Long Beach don' flipped crazy durange
Everybody sellin' out, word of mouth, the OG's tellin' now
I drove there the other day
To chop some game with my big homie Donald Ray
Its sort of hard for me to run away
Step out my car no gun today, underlay
I press my luck, if I get stuck, well then thats whats up
How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

The true definition of that mixtape
How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me
Somebody pass that piff, grow it up

[Song 133: Young, Wild & Free (Clean)]
3 ContributorsYoung, Wild & Free (Clean) Lyrics
Is this thing on? Word

So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
We don’t care who sees
So what? We go out (Ayy, let me get a lighter, please)
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free (Keep the L in there)

So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real, if y'all don't know me
Keep it player for these bros
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll up bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And burn them things down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your chick smokin’ grade A

You know what?
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Upfront, four (four), like, “Khalifa put the *ding* in a J”

So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
We don’t care who sees
So what? We go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

And I don't even care
'Long as me and my team in there
There's gon' be some green in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, **** as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
We don’t care who sees
So what? We go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we're all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we're all just having fun

So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
And we don’t care who sees
So what? We go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

We don’t care who sees
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

But you probably won't believe me
That's why I'm smokin, ridin, listenin
To "Doggy Style" on CD
They saw me on TV
Now they gon try they hardest to be me
Say she know just who I am
And plus my team is undefeated
I'm the man in my city
If you want I got the key
I could put you on the game
Or on the ocean by the beach
Everything you see I own
I don't got a lease
If your bitch outta control
Better put that ho on a leash, (Ummm)
If you listenin to what I'm tryna tell ya
Every dime pays, but they catchin messin with that high grade
They gon try and fail ya
Call up mom's tell her "You in the hallway, Plus your clothes smell kinda familiar"
I ain't trippin
I'm twistin up another one
Gotta couple problems with my bitches Dogg
Cuz Pimpin Ain't (EASY)
I'm Rolling up tree
Staying low from police
And don't ask where I've been
Dogg I'm going where the cheese be
Haters talk, When I leave
They just front, when they see
What they want, say they dont
But they need me...
I'm like a fucking Game Genie
Young Nigga, But I make it look EASY!!!

It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy

Flying on a plane, plane
Givin to the same thang
Never the same game
She ask me if I gang bang
If Peter Piper Pick em
Then Snoopy Doopy Pimp Em
The track is where I kick it
Now baby suck a dick or
Until you start to Hick Up
Now look here Breezy
It's real Hard, But you could make it Easy
I am pleasurable, now baby please me
And once I get up in it, I'll make you need me
Like I love weed leaf, baby starvin
Now she feed me, believe me, you complete me
Protect the spot, and when I'm in school
Lay Low, Be Cool, connect the dot.,
I do it vagrantly, truent agencies on my wing tips
I ditched English for Old English 40 oz low
With some Buddha Thai
Mixed it with some kush smoke
For the ET High, So I'mma phone home
Baby want some Knick Knack Paddy Whack
Give Her Doggy Bone
We Home alone, Now she sucking on my bone
Michauley Pfipher
Nascar Driver
Rolling wit real East Sider
It Could Be Easy....
It could be easy
Make the smallest little things seem oh so hard
It could be easy
Tell me would you really be who you are
Who you are
And it's been done before, I think you should know
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy
It could be easy

17 ContributorsNeva Have 2 Worry Lyrics
1992
"Deep Cover" hit the world and fell in love with Snoop
"Doggystyle" came out, it's like I dropped a bomb
One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time
I was young gettin' money, livin' wild and free
Got on and I brought the whole Pound with me
Didn't matter who's around, I kept it way too G
Niggas knew it was Eastside L.B.C
Gangsta shit
That's what a motherfuckin' gangsta get
The one up above didn't like my pace
I was movin' too fast and I caught that case
I fought that case
Wonder where the West would be if I'da lost that case
I slow mine down
Swimmin' with the sharks and I almost drowned

I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

I'm finally out
And the critics hated on me 'cause I went to the South
Said I wasn't gon' shine, had me left for dead
Switched sides, now my old boss want me dead
Dropped the first of the three and you said it was weak
"No Limit Top Dogg", the return of the beast
So from that point on I know what to do
Don't worry 'bout them, just do what you do
"Last Meal" was the one that took me off the leash
That's the last time a nigga gon' eat off of me
Stack plaque after plaque, gain millions sold
I'm the Bo$$ of this bitch and I ain't never went Gold, nigga

I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

Bo$$ of the City, Boss of the Coast
Some other niggas tried but none of 'em come close
They stuck lookin' silly, but nothin' like a loc
The Bigg Bow Wow, I kill it with one stroke
(Wow!) That's what it's about
They tryin' to tell a nigga what could come out his mouth
Motherfucker I'm a G, but first I'm a man
Freedom of Speech, bitch is a word you can't ban
So they blamin' me, sayin' this my talk
To some women as hoes, like it's my fault
Damn they lost, man they just don't know
That a bitch is a bitch and a ho is a ho
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'm gon' be smokin' dank, livin' like a boss
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'mma be smokin' my dank, livin' like a boss, nigga

I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

I'm the one that showed you how a real crip walk
Resume, document, G-File
Recollect, reflect, and let me break it down
Take it out the bag, lay it on the table quick
Call my handlers, I handle and disable this
Tickin' time bomb, made crippin' look fun
Can't walk around without your motherfuckin' gun, that's a no no
Real hood redemption, my tiny Lokos is really on a mission

It wasn't no rappers talking 'bout the LBC, am I trippin' y'all? (Hell nah)
So it's safe to say, I put it on the map, huh
So if you see me on the block, yeah, I'm back, huh
And if you don't think you know where I'm at, huh
You wanna battle, little homie, get your racks up
Boy you need to kit kat, make you niggas get back
Split you like a kit kat, the big homie did that
Rollin' like a rebel though, I'm on a whole 'nother level though
My heart, my hair, My G, my seat, that part right there
I'm more than a rapper though, pure intellectual
Smooth as a criminal, you hear me though?

It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

M.L. and 21st, where niggas worse
Quick to put one in ya first
Before they search your pockets get that china
And where they got ya that's where they gon' find ya
They rollin' out there nigga, that's that real shit
Where bein' slick can get you caught up real quick
Hold up homie, don't let this money blind ya
Cause you won't see me standin' right behind ya
Then it's time's up, that's how we talkin' if he come from the Beach
Better watch them niggas out here if they come from the East
Don't stop if I'm not out somewhere so niggas can see
Cause they don't give a fuck, you stuck if you ain't with me
My city's a beast..
You can't walk through the Beach unless you walk with a piece
You can't talk to police cause most police is like me
They get that cheddar like they want it, take yo' shit in the street

They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea

It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

This L.A. County nigga
If you's a bitch then get yo' ass from 'round here nigga
Before they come put bullets in yo' brain
Cause in the hood ain't nothin' really changed
They tryin' to get that paper just like Uncle Sam
And just like Sam niggas just don't give a damn
They mission is to leave yo' ass in pain
Cause they don't give a fuck about a thing
It's a cold game, that's how they talkin' if they walk on the West
Better watch yourself without this star protectin' your chest
These niggas come from nowhere, get to takin' yo' shit
You'll get beat outside the set and then sent home in your stretch
This shit is a mess..
You can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest
You can't talk to police cause most police ain't gon' stress
They get that cheddar like they want it with they foot in your chest

They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea

It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here
It ain't safe to leave the house
Fuck around 'round here
These niggas quick to air ya out
And lay ya down 'round here
You run your mouth niggas will put ya
In the ground 'round here
One-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here

[Song 138: So Misinformed]
17 ContributorsSo Misinformed Lyrics
I would like to say to this gentleman and all other people who are not blessed with melanin at this point in time to understand that what has happened in our history is that you have been misinformed as much as we have been misinformed.
Much of the information that is brought forth, not only from Doctor Mohammed, but other areas, other scholars, are not available to you as a sister said in your curriculum that you've had for 400 years when you did not allow us to read and write, it was being hidden.
Whether you, sir, personally did that or not, it was a legacy that was passed onto you.
And I end by saying the Holocaust is simply the greatest atrocity on film.
Ours was not filmed.

(Get up, stand up) No apology, equality
(Stand up for your rights) Youth is future, let's move forward
(Get up, stand up) Healthy mentality helps sanity
(Stand up for your rights) Melting Pot, help us up, vote or not
(Get up, stand up) Facts half backwards and inaccurate
(Stand up for your rights) Tell folks no backin' up, track it up
(Get up, stand up) Good over evil, deceitful
(Don't give up the fight) Morals, principles, it's simple, son

What will it take for my peoples to connect together?
You know it's black excellence if we compete together
Picture a photograph of black folks lit together
In high definition, in high, I would never
Turn my back on the block, I got the block on my back
Like James Brown, boy, I'm proud to be black
To all my sisters, Mother Earth has birthed us
Lurchers, it hurts us first, less heard this
To all my sisters, ain't no knockin' you back
Politicans politickin' with a gown and a cap
The house got flavor and I like it like that
Black girl power, yeah, I'm rockin' with that
Doors is gettin' kicked down, statues is gettin' ripped down
Presidents meetin' overseas just to have a sitdown

They tryna keep us from runnin' up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up

(Get up, stand up) No apology, equality
(Stand up for your rights) Youth is future, lets move forward
(Get up, stand up) Healthy mentality helps sanity
(Stand up for your rights) Melting Pot, help us up, vote or not

(Stand up for your rights) Tell folks no backin' up, track it up
(Get up, stand up) Good over evil, deceitful
(Don't give up the fight) Morals, principles, it's simple, son (Son)
So what are you saying?

The foundation was laid, y'all nation was made
Off our ancestors' back, back, back in the day
Four hundred years ago, y'all made us slaves
And you can hear it in the spirit comin' deep from the graves
Life is a maze
Smoke so much dope you in a daze
But you ain't trippin', you gettin' paid
Who do you praise? But anyways
I read a history book, but I ain't learned nothin', dawg
So I read the Bible, then the holy Quran
Went to Jamaica to acquire my knowledge
Sat with some Rastas 'til my game got polished
The gangbang extreme with malice
Trees and degrees like I'm trained for college

They tryna keep us from runnin' up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up

(Get up, stand up) No apology, equality
(Stand up for your rights) Youth is future, lets move forward
(Get up, stand up) Healthy mentality helps sanity
(Stand up for your rights) Melting Pot, help us up, vote or not

[Song 139: This Weed Iz Mine]
19 ContributorsThis Weed Iz Mine Lyrics
I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
Smoking on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy envy, please don't feel bad
This weed is mine get your own bag
A sack full of OG under lock and key
None for the homies this is all for me
Got a blunt looking like a Cali palm tree
Police roll by I got nothing on me
Cause the smoke is already in the air
I'm rolled up with two braids in my hair
I'll start with the kaki sweet
I'm gonna fuck around and take it back to classic Snoop
On the east side standing on the VIP
Back when my only red was me E-Y-E
You so PYT and you're looking so fine
I'm sorry baby girl but tonight

This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine

Get back to the episode, sacks of the chronic
Out of this world, could relax on a comet
This is church music, listen to the choir
To burn my kush, you must use fire
D-O double G like never heard before
Smoking that bomb like THC4
West coast worldwide sea shore to sea shore
When is the last time you've seen a G in a G4?
Don't worry I'll wait
Time is ticking I'm tripping
I'm slipping away
Into the zone where these hoes with they dogg on
A dogg whistle and they download my ring zone
And she is hypnotized by this pimp's poem
What I got here is mine go get your own
I put this to rhymes, get piece of mind
Oz's to die for, this weed is mine

This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine

I hear niggas talking about what they rolling up
Smell what I smoke before the bag open up
Good chance if you see me that I'm smoking one
License to get it and roll this shit
Real nigga, buying weed, I dunn sold enough
If I'm in the building it's hard not to notice it
Hit em with ? I got some hoes to fuck
I'mma hit em with an ounce of the potent shit
Don't trip bitch, we gon all sip & blow the whole zip
Let you hit mine, plus you supplyin' your own little bit
My nigga get high and let the hoes twist!
Say you don't fuck, impressed how you rolled it
They ain't smoking like ours
I'm rolling, I'm smoking, they burning for hours
And if it's fire, I'm smoking the whole thing, getting tired

This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine

I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me?
Do you?
Do you wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me?

[Song 140: Murder Music]
22 ContributorsMurder Music Lyrics
What it do, Loc? Yeah (Yeah)
We up in this motherfucker
On some murder murder, kill kill shit (Uh)
Yeah, (The Butcher comin', nigga)
Some real hip-hop shit

Yo, murder music, just for this type of shit they could ban us
'Cause this what they gon' play when they wipe they prints off they hammers
I'm really like that, I ain't just write this shit for the camera
I did in my city what Michael Vick did in Atlanta (Yeah)
Cash saved for insurance, them bad days wasn't for us (Nah)
Still hood, roach clips and the ashtrays on my foreign (Haha)
In L.A., R&B bitch drunk with her hands around me
The night Swizz introduced me to Nas at a Grammy party (Uh-huh)
When my shrimp introducеd me to hard, I had grams around me (No)
A star player nеver asks for the ball, they just playin' around me
Niggas heard I took a shot, they was askin' if I was good
I looked the shooter right in his eyes when that trigger got pulled
Huh

Murder music, mur-murder music
Murder music, murder music (Yeah)
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music (Ha-ha)

Yeah, some come through the water (Uh-huh)
Some come through the border (Uh)
Some of them get caught, but that's dependin' on the porter (Yup)
Old niggas hidin', young niggas slidin' (Ughn)
I'm bein' a man just protectin' and providin'
My only concern is if it cooked right (That's it)
My chain yellow, way the diamonds set up, it make it look white (Ooh)
Kill you for nothin' 'cause they petty (Uh)
Cut into dog food with the fetti (Yup)
They young but they ready (They ready)
No crowd, I get my applause off the beat
I'm a boss so I make sure all of us eat (All of us)
Say, a couple funerals'll bring a war to a cease (Woo)
And remember, it ain't no reward for the streets
This is not normal (Nah) dickey suit is how we dress formal (Yeah)
The way I'm ridin' these tracks like a porno (Woo)
Aight then, what's up then? (What's up?) I'm bustin'
Every control substance I touched it, I know it's disgustin' (Agh)
I'm just stackin', call me El Guapo (Uh-huh)
And I bet you never had a brick from El Chapo (Never)
Tuesday, I just play the crib and make tacos (Woo)
A lot of niggas frontin' like they nice, but they not though
Y'all spoke that up, now soak that up (Soak that up)
They done pulled my coat, nigga, the GOAT got up, what's up?

Murder music, mur-murder music
Murder music, murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, (Yo) mur-murder music

I only got time to murder shit
I bang 'em while deafening both ears (Uh-huh)
When I'm makin' niggas black
And rip couches and throw chairs (Uh-huh)
At times I be unleashin' the wrath that most fear (Uh-huh)
I don't discriminate, I even body close peers
See I'm suggestin' most you niggas should get to steppin' to the rear (Uh-huh)
And fuck what most you niggas'll talk, I don't care (Uh-uh)
If you don't rep it right, you shouldn't come around here (Oh no)
Adjust one level up, make sure a nigga sound clear
They wanna stop, and wanna stare (They do)
They hate that I'm the best and it's greatness in the flesh and it's pointless to compare (Uh-huh)
You need to scribe this jewelry I write to save this shit on a server (Uh-huh)
And type the way that I speak for movin' space on a cursor
I'm not an advocate for violence, but push me, I'ma push you further
The script, hand on my hips, squeezin' the grip a little firmer (Huh)
These dumb niggas don't realize that it's better to be a learner
(Stupid ni-)
But when you don't is when you get the feelin' of burner
Shut the fuck up, it's better to be watchers, listeners, and observers
'Cause if you not, you'll fuck around, that's how niggas like you get murdered

Murder music, mur-murder music
Murder music, murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music

Murder was the case, the-the, the case
The case was murder

[Song 141: Think About It]
14 ContributorsThink About It LyricsThe track “Think About It” was composed by Frequency in his dorm room one and a half year prior to this album while he was a student in Virginia. The material was passed to Mike Chavez of Geffen Records who… Read More Yeah man...
"You know it's easy to talk about.. doin somethin
But when it comes down to the action part, well most folks take a little light vacation"

Mmmm.. I was just thinkin to myself man
Y'know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me
And I need to let my
Peoples know how deep it is to me
On some real talk like...
It's like lookin and poppin and seein whoppers and movers
Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low
Nobody's guidance so I decide to sleep by the do'
Open my mind try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'
Driftin off into another stage of life
Nigga paid ya price and big homies made ya fight
Niggas ain't wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no
Toe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo'

Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open ya eyes and take ya time to visualize
And once ya decide to move ya mind in due time
It's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin naughty
Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move ya body
It's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest
You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it

Fuck that nigga, I'mma do it right
Thangs ain't movin right, I don't think that you would like
For me to be mad, saying, "Niggas can't stand me"
Sittin at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy's
Wishin I was there, naw nigga I don't wish no more
I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl
Basically you hear these rappers out here using my flow
They need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though
In dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI
Takin my time, chronolizing my rhyme
Writing my rhyme, tryin to get intellectual
Directing the weather, makin my negative records more intellectual
Tryin to change the direction of flowin
And sayin, born sayin, "You know I get live-er when I get fluent"
Ain't been nobody to change game since King came
Same thing, same lane, then biggy-biggy-bang
Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope
Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable
And they don't know how to do it cause they don't flow that way
Go that way, roll that Jay
Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony
You're so into what ya doin but you can't get into it
You can't talk and now ya ruined but y'know I'mma do it
And now you doin it, they booing like, "You blew it! You blew it!"
I'm dippin through the universe, make 'em move the verse
Do the Luda verse, hit the buddha first
You can never beat a ho, lemme show you how to treat a ho
If you likin me, follow me, you so believable
(So...) Got a way to get his own music out
Record executive, bounce ballin and actin bad
Take my time, with my.. great mind
Take 'em out, make mine, kicked about it
Thanks to niggas who might make it illegal
And not rival the Beatles, and rock, rockin my peoples
And fly, fly like eagles been doin the shit like liters
And hittin y'all with heaters and walkin in my Adidas
I continue to bust, then I switched up to chucks
Givin niggas a puff, still givin it up
Beanie Sigel what up? Real niggas is up
On the scheme with my team, yeah Daz and Kurupt


We bust 'til we buss 'em up
Lay Low, I know they told you not to fuck with us
Layin and playin, and sayin man, walkin in vain
Anxious for fame, my nigga tryin to walk in my lane
And tryin to.. walk in my shoes but they just don't fit
You couldn't spit the shit that I spit cause I'm the shit
And this is it, legit, let's split the chips
And fix, and move the work and hurt that bitch
I'm through with this! {*crowd cheers*}

[Song 142: Young, Wild, and Free-Pershern]
7 ContributorsYoung, Wild, and Free-Pershern LyricsSo what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, uh huh
So what I keep ‘em rolled up
Saggin’ my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I’m with you bitch smokin’ grade A
You know what? It’s like I’m seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I’m on the chase
Chevy, its gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keep slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front four blunts, like “Khalifa put the weed in a J”
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, and now I don't even care
'Cause me and my team in here
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin'
And now ya knowin'
When I step right up
Get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are looking up
From the ground up
Pound up
It's Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up
And mount up
And do my thang
Now I'm chillin'
Fresh outta class feelin'
Like I'm on my own
And I could probably own a building
Got my own car
No job, no children
Had this science project
Me and Mac killed it
T-H-C
M-A-C
D-E-V
H-D-3
High as me
This is us
We gon' fuss
And we gon' fight
And we gon' roll
And live our life
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out

21 ContributorsConflicted Lyrics
If God for me, who could be against me?
I guess all them niggas that's against me
They the ones stirrin' up the conflict
Then try to make it out like I'm conflicted
Bitches
East Coast niggas in six-fours hittin' switches (Shit)
It's not a conflict of interest
Cuh, them niggas with the business
West Coast niggas rockin' them Timberlands deep up in them trenches
It's no difference

Neither one play games when swingin' for them fences
We want the finer things, the shit that's еxpensive
The shit that hit 'еm either close range or at a distance
If God for me, nigga, why bother?
I got my game from the Godfather (Woof)
Top of the food chain, rock bottom
And handled my business when it was my problem
G shit, nigga flossin' with a gold chain
I got my Turkish rope with matchin' gold fangs
Bomber jacker in the winter, it's a cold game
I met some East Coast niggas up in Spokane (What up?)
Some of the realest niggas in this dope game
I got my curly top, lookin' like Special Ed
Clean fade on the side, bumpin' that Redhead
Clean tags when I ride, duckin' the fed-feds
East Coast niggas, they get that bread-bread
You fuck with them niggas, you end up dead-dead
Them West Coast niggas, they leave that lead spread
And now you got bullets all in your dread head

If God for me, who could be against me?
I guess all them niggas that's against me
They the ones stirrin' up the conflict
Then try to make it out like I'm conflicted
Bitches
Still tryna fuck the riches
East Coast niggas in six-fours hittin' switches (Shit)
It's not a conflict of interest
Cuh, them niggas with the business
West Coast niggas rockin' them Timberlands deep up in them trenches
It's no difference

Fourth and inches
I'm finna hit a lick and handle business
I got a down bitch, she real vicious
Rock-a-bye baby, no witness
This is not even a conflict
You niggas on nonsense
Niggas die the same way in Brooklyn and Compton
But niggas with that gang-gang, them niggas make a profit
Niggas on top, niggas stay poppin'
Look, see, I was the high school Slick Rick, I was stylin'
Fat gold chain with an African medallion
Hip-hop connoisseur and Rollin' 20 Crippin'
Rap game real tight, freestyle was magnificent
All about the clout and all about my dividends
Them older niggas couldn't tell me different
I need a 'round the way girl to let me stick it in
Showtime at the Apollo
I'm drinking OE up out the bottle
Take two swigs and pour out a little liquor for my niggas who won't live to see tomorrow

If God for me, who could be against me?
I guess all them niggas that's against me
They the ones stirrin' up the conflict
Then try to make it out like I'm conflicted

It's time

If it ain't KK, what you smoking on
If it ain't Rosé, tell 'em carry on
It ain't 'bout mine 'less the money long
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na

Fat sack in hand, Mac and Dev
Back in dreads, stacking bread
Kush in the air errywhere I be
Word is Doggy Dogg got that 10 a key
You can believe what you wanna, loc
See, I'ma pee on the tree when I wanna smoke
Underground to the top shelf
And I can do it by my goddamn self
I put some fire on the tip
High when I trip, still fly on a bitch
I'ma ease on by
Tip top, don't stop, why not, not why
See, I'ma regulate it
Real shit, real niggas, real weed separated
And put the match on the tip
So quick, so fast like that, you bitch

If it ain't KK, what you smoking on
If it ain't Rosé, tell 'em carry on
It ain't 'bout mine 'less the money long
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na

Came in this thang, blowing on the strongest Mary Jane
Make sure everybody know my name
Niggas know we go hard, so we young bosses in the game
Now I'm getting weed on the plane
It's such a shame, your bitch with us
Hatin' on me 'cause you probably can't get rich with us
Probably run around, claim you a real nigga too
But I'ma fuck her, never call like real niggas do, ooh
No pain, no gain
I be on the yacht drunk, sipping champagne
Partying with Snoop Dogg, smoking propane
Screaming rest in peace June Bug with my whole gang
Uhh, niggas hate but I just laugh at that
A milly first quarter, you ain't half of that
Talking trees, we can go pack for pack
All day, we just smoke back to back

If it ain't KK, what you smoking on
If it ain't Rosé, tell 'em carry on
It ain't 'bout mine 'less the money long
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na

Sometimes I feel lost like a runaway, read over the dire
Reap while I stay gettin Richard like Pryor
Need to put the gun away cause I got priors
It's hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders
Bullet tip on fire, flyin down sunset
Motivated to win, like I ain't won yet
Think shit over? Hell naw I ain't done yet
I L-B-see y'all prayin that a G fall
Tonight it's goin down like free fall
Chevy bouncin up and down like a fuckin see-saw
Trippin off hate, no Hee-Haw
All blacks locs on the loc actin like I don't see y'all
Doing that shit to demean Dogg
But when I bring it to you, you be like "What you mean Dogg?"
Then we go back and forth, like it's ping-pong
Knowin I should just ring ya bell, ding dong!
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxers
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors?
I'm gone then you suddenly hip-hoppin?
Sheeit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a beam like a M&M
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but ain't talkin Eminem
So fuck you, him, and him
I was gangbangin befo' a nigga entered in
No facade, I went from the yard
To a three-car garage to, instant menage it's
Vintage, relentless, I mean this, I promise
No Suge, No Dre, I'da did this regardless
And thats what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucker this Crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin 40's still a big deal
Ponytail still swangin, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded
Nigga! So buzz on that shit
Backflip back to plaque shit
Blue red white to black shit, but for the green
I send a whole motherfuckin team to clap shit
React to mack shit, problem, terrorist
Fuck this rap shit!

Shots fired
Suspect down
Request EMT immediately

[Song 147: Back Up]
14 ContributorsBack Up Lyrics
High speed chase, 405 is the freeway
Slangin' my- bangin' my- swangin' my Coupe de Ville
Scoop DeVille
Like that, right back, top of the hill
Wheel in my hand with a trunk full of contraband
Swimmin' under water like I'm Aquaman
I used to drink gin, now it's vodka, man
Boss Dawg is the baller, no propagand'
I'll pop yo band, don't try and stop the plan
I'll rock your land, step back and pop yo man
Spaced out, caked out, no bug-a-boo
Flipped out, Cripped out, nigga, what it really do?
Time brings change, so I changed my name
Tryna take flight while they clippin' my wings
Groupie ass niggas, see you tripping again
With nothing to gain, plop plop, pop and I bang

Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up

Thirty days later I'm back on the streets
Got a batch of bomb beach, shit I'm trying to eat
Feet to the pavement; money, I'm cravin' it
What about the bitches Dogg? Are you savin' 'em?
Can a blind man see? (No)
Can a shark survive outta water for a week? (No)
A snitch is a snitch if he solemnly speak
I don't know near nothin', I'm a product of the beach
To each his own, hard as stone
Lot of y'all niggas 'bout as hard as foam
Dead wrong, tryin' to sneak Tamika the phone
Step back nephew or feel the heat of the chrome
G-ma and PawPaw and the heat of my comb
Plate full of shit nigga, I never eat it alone
Heat it alone, then I put the weed in the bong
Step back at the feet of my throne mothafucka

Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up

Cinematic, right back at it
Talk the walk and walk 'bout that static
I am the extra dramatic
When he popped back, everybody scattered, didn't matter
I was there from the get-go
Movin' heavy weights, Klitschko
Rookies and cookies from 'Frisco
Put 'em in a box, Nabisco
We the funk that killed disco
I showed you how to go and get this dough
And I'm the reason why you're fuckin' with this ho
But don't thank me, that's how the shit go
It's still banging Crypto from the intro
Nigga what they hidden fo'?
Hol' up, who is that tryin' to come through?
Step back and get mic checked; 1, 2

Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up

Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine

Get yours, I take mine
Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine
Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine

Aye, baby back up, baby back up

9 ContributorsYou Can Put it in a Zag, I’mma Put it in a Blunt LyricsWiz Khalifa is known for smoking joints only.
Yo Devin, what up god?
It's the big Mac, yeah
I got this new shit right here man
You might wanna hit this
Trip, mmmh

You can put it in a zag, I'mma put it in a blunt
You can sit in the back, I'mma sit in the front
No stunt, no pump
It really don't matter cause I got what they want
You can put it in a zag, I'mma put it in a blunt
You can sit in the back, I'mma sit in the front
No stunt, no pump
It really don't matter cause I got what they want

They say all day we play in blow
See this is the only thing we know
I blow kush again on the push again
With a bad little cute little Mexican, uh
Uh, Zig Zag how I roll mine
You can tell I be a G how I hold mine
I ain't in a load of shit I'mma own mine
Bitch fuck with me stumble on a gold mine
Break bread, fake dead, punk bitch this is real life
Executive Branch, what it feel like?
Catch me if you can I'm your local kush man
Sitting in the stands with a hundred grand in my pants
And I blow so much smoke
Pure OG hit it once might choke
See I'mma go kick it with a bitch I could poke
And you could ride to high school take a toke

You can put it in a zag, I'mma put it in a blunt
You can sit in the back, I'mma sit in the front
No stunt, no pump
It really don't matter cause I got what they want
You can put it in a zag, I'mma put it in a blunt
You can sit in the back, I'mma sit in the front
No stunt, no pump
It really don't matter cause I got what they want

Uh, no stems no seeds
Mac gave me all the class that a nigga need
Just taught my old bitch how to roll weed
And a nigga riding with me getting high with me
Squares are revving to my young nigga Devin
Got the hanging out with Mac now we 24/7
On the go smoking dro, deep on the Westside
Banging where its hood at, yep you gotta love that
Yep I love that, niggas used to offer but I wouldn't
Now I'm all asking where the bud at
Making it happen me and Mac just got two bitches cracking
And they say they trying to smoke weed all night and down for getting tatted
Spatted up and tatted up, suit it up and boot it up
Pioneers baby, ain't nothing that you could do to us
N. Hale, that's the high school, Dev and Mac
You we act like a damn fool, ya dig?

You know what?
It may sound crazy but uh
Yeah, Dev and Mac
High school
It may sound crazy but uh
It may sound crazy but uh
It may sound crazy but uh

You thought it was gone, but it's on once again
Light up the chronic, while I take a couple of sips of the gin
If it, If it Dre (uh huh) If it, if it Snoop (uh huh)
Back on track as we roll like a 7-8 coupe
De Ville, you chill on the funk cut
Guess what? (What up?)
We still loccin' up
So those who oppose will get smacked up nicely
By the smooth macadamian who's awfully sheisty
Some thinking that I would switch, but I’m never to ever switch
Still clockin' the grip and I give a fuck about a bitch, baby
I gotta have it you see, and so does my diggy-dog
The motherfucking Doctor D-R-E

I'm still Saucin
Cause I'm the boss and
Say they flossin'
Cause it’s Compton
Every baddest bitch who wants to get broke off
Thats how I do it, get into it
With the fluid, and I thought you knew it
Doing it like this and doing it like that
And, uh, when it comes to gats the nine has to know I'm rastlin
Why try to put up a fight when I can just grab my chrome and put it to your dome?
Only make ya thank, so before you try to gank
Would you ask your stank about my bank or ya strength
(The 1-5-1)
Cause that's what you're dealing with
My 9 double-m, that's what I kill 'em with
If you keep coming at the Doc like he's (crazy)
Fucking with Snoop, you’ll be pushing up daisies
Niggas who talk shit really don't (faze me)
Cause ain't nothing but a 'G' thang (baby)

Now Gs, not BGs, but OGs
"What about the women Snoop?" bitch, please
I ain't got time to be pent up for a ho
Even if she giving up dough
Yo ho, no
(Baby)
Your love is so out of reach
You must've forgot that I was born and raised in Long Beach
Where the hoes come a dime a dozen
You start fronting on the pussy then I fucked your cousin
I ain't buzzin'
I'mma get mine straight up
I'm still Doggy Dogg, so what would I have to wait if knowin they ho'in
Throwin' the pussy at a nigga like me
Cause I’m shakin' ‘em, bakin’ ‘em, takin’ ‘em, fakin’ ‘em
Makin 'em brake they selves, G
And your pooh-butt nigga bet' not trips
So you know I got a grip on my shit
And I'll bust a cap if he approaches me
Just to let him see how a real motherfuckin' G
Can turn into murderer with just one switch
Die try to throw up for your ugly-ass bitch
Now you're put to rest and there's no coming back
As I groove in my life just to show you where it's at
So get a glimpse of a pimp who kicks back
It's still like this and like that (Hell yeah)
And you say that I'm crazy
But ain't nuthin' but a 'G' thang baby

For one of forty-four ways
The motherfuckin' D-R-E is getting paid
Cause I fade, the shit's made, I lay real shit
Never let no motherfucker feel shit
That's something Dre can never deal with
I don't want no motherfuckin' bitches on my roster
Cross the road when you know we're gonna cross ya
You don't want no problems then
So get my motherfuckin' nuts, I rock cuts then fuck sluts
So what's the deal?
As I reveal
The true feeling that I know you wanna feel
Still do it like a motherfuckin' nigga for life
If you slippin with your bitch then I'll be fucking your wife
They call me Dre but also the notorious one
Dre G, thats why I'm always holding my gun
Gun days then went months and sold blunts
That made it that fat
On top of that, they don't know where my stash at
Yo, so business was as usual
Ain't no trippin' because I know you know what I do to you
The O-N-E, the M-U-R-D-E-R
You'll never make it to tomorrow
If, you come at me like I'm crazy
Take a look at how the streets straight raised me
And how your whole motherfuckin' city plays me
Cause ain't nothing but a G thang (baby)

[Song 150: Ballin’]
17 ContributorsBallin’ LyricsThe 7 track on Snoops Doggs album “Paid Tha Cost To Be Da Bo$$”.
The song samples “Fell for You” performed by The Dramatics.
Snoop talks about him balling (living the good life) with a very chill out vibe.
Like a star slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky
Tumbling through space
When you touch my hand
I swear I feel like I'm ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Like a wheel
Whirling round and round
Rolling down a hill (rollin' down a hill)
Spinning on the ground (rollin' down a hill)
Your kissing makes me dizzy yeh
In the head (ooh yeh)
And I'm ballin'
I'm ballin'

Hmm, I love this game coz this game love me back
I'm pushing a lac, smoking sacs like a mad mac
Bringing me back, banging the 8-track track
The Dramatics and Battle Cat and Snoop like that
Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs and sit at the big bars
Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier
Hell yeh you are, yeh you are
Say it say it, coz they all deny it
Player play it, coz you can't deny it
As fly as it get, as fly as I spit you know its the shit
It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch
Switch back to the old school, old fools know
This here thang we do so original
I got to have it, lavish
Is how we establish
On the real love one it feels good to have

Like a rose, flippin down the street
Looking oh so sweet (lookin' oh so sweet)
Bumpin to the beat (bumpin to the beat)
These streets they keep me busy yeh
Makin' bread
And I'm ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Oh here I go!
Ballin making dough
Working for myself
Coz it thrills me so
I keep women on my line
Coz they know
That I'm ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Oh here I go!
Driving down the road
I can't help myself
Ballin' Thrills me so
Yeh you blew my mind
And I know , I'm ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')

Do that, who that, you that one they called on
Baller' get your ball on
It's all on now fall on to a new groove
Really ain't nothing to prove
We, set the mood
Or shoot some pool
Or blaze a Cool
What? Whatup fool
Now you can cruise if you choose but I prefer to do the cha-cha
And once my smoke hit ya throat
You know I gotcha
Watch out, no need to pull your Glock out
It's a players affair, now
Look at my hair and the girls wit me
They got the same thang on
Pimp pimp parade, my nigga get your bang on
Coz my uncles about to get their sang on
And all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song
And when its time for your callin', fallin', wit no stallin'
Keep it ballin'

He starts to mill
Just rollin' tru his town
Stacking dollar bills (stacking dollar bills)
Raising dogg pound (he be raising the dog pound)
Becasuse he's loved
Loved in every city
Thats why he's ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')

There it is coz it is there
Now have a seat and come hit the game from a player
They say time brings change and change brings time
It's so genuine and so divine
It's been so long in fact its overdue
Now tell me baby girl what can D-O-DOUBLE-G do for you
I fell for you, I'll always look over you
Theres really not much that a player would'nt do for you
So quit stallin' and fallin'
And come get a bar of some of this ballin'
Now quit stallin' and callin'
And come get yaself a bar of this ballin'

Yeh thats right, this is ahh, radio station 187.4 DG
Sock it to your ass
With something from The Dramatics
And Snoop Dogg
Produced by Battlecat ok
It's another one of those world premiers
Doin' it to ya doggystyle, in ya air hole
For the 2000 plus 1, yeh
