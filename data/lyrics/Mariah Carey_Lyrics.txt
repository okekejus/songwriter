I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)

Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothin', I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lyin' to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

The feelin' that I'm feelin' now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lyin' by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who else)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singin' to me, "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, "I only think of you"
And it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm fallin' apart

I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryna figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feelin' inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)
(We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
(We belong together) (Who will?)
When you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?)
It's still so hard to believe (Who will?)
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gon' talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gon' take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

(Who will? Who will? Who will?)
We belong together

So, oh, oh-oh-oh (MC, the MC)

All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping

Ooh-oh, woah
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex

Oh, oh, oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So, oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh)
So, oh, oh-oh-oh (And all my ladies say)
So, oh, oh-oh-oh

You on your job, you hating hard
Ain't gon' feed you, I'ma let you starve
Grasping for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waiting
Telling the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you tripping?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you a conversation

Ooh, woah, woah, woah
Why you so obsessed with me? And boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind (Mind)
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know?
Why you wasting your time? (Time)
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex

Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So, oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh)

Ooh, woah, woah, woah
(Hey, he's all up in my George Foreman)
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
(Lying that you're sexing Mimi)
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh (Eh)
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this (No)
You're delusional, you're delusional (Ah)
(He's all up in my George Foreman)
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know?
(But I can't do nothing for him)
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex
(You love me, you love me, you really, really love me)

When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams

Oh, oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams

With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

Oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby

When you dance like that, your jeans so tight

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you

Steady breaking me on down
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but that you're just not in love
Immediately, I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was okay
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind (losing my mind)
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
(Underneath the guise of a smile)
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry

So, what do you do when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride and sing "I will survive"
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you lash out and say "How dare you leave this way"
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it

And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
Steady breaking me on down
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind (losing my mind)

Steady breaking me on down
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night

Gonna break you down
Only if you let it
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Trying to break me down
But I won't let it
Forget it

I be feeling like you're breaking me down
Kicking me around, stressing me out
I think you better go and get out
And let me release some stress

Don't ever wanna feel no pain
Hoping for the sun but it looks like rain
Lord, I just wanna maintain

Yeah, I'm feeling pressures y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it

And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
(How do I feel?)
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
(What do you think? You gotta know I'm suffering, so I...)
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
(I turn off the lights and breakdown and cry)
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on
And turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry
Gotta get control and roll roll roll on

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
Break-breakdown
(Cry, cry, cry)
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
Steady breaking me on down
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Break-breakdown
(Cry, cry, cry)
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
Steady breaking me on down
(Cry, cry, cry)
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
Break-breakdown
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
Steady breaking me on down
(Cry, cry, cry)
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
Break-breakdown
And turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry
Steady breaking me on down

I don't wanna break down
Break-breakdown
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
I don't wanna break down
Steady breaking me on down

Uh, uh, uh, in the place to be
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I know that you been waiting for it, I'm waiting too
In my imagination, I be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me, hundred and two
And, boy, I know I feel the same, my temperature's through the roof

If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gon' leave with me when I do, I do
If there's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
'Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, 'tween you and I

Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

Boy, you can put me on you like a brand-new white tee
I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
And float away with you in the Caribbean Sea

If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gon' leave with me when I do, I do
If there's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
'Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, 'tween you and I

Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

I'ma treat you like a teddy bear
You won't wanna go nowhere
In the lap of luxury
Laying intertwined with me (La-la-la-la-da-da-da)
You won't want for nothing, boy (No)
I will give you plenty joy (Touch my body)

Touch my body, put me on the floor (Throw me on the floor)
Wrestle me around, play with me some more (Ooh, touch my body)
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs (Let me wrap my thighs)
All around your waist, just a little taste (Around your waist for just a little taste)
Touch my body, know you like my curves (I know you like it)
Come on and give me what I deserve (Give me what I deserve, babe)
And touch my body

Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now, we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long, before we knew we could
(Oh, yes)

There can be miracles, when you believe!
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles, you can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe!

Ah, uh, yeah!
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles, when you believe!
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles, you can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe!

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in, to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small but still resilient voice, says "Help is very near!", (oh)

There can be miracles, (miracles) when you believe!
(When you believe!)
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill, (oh)
Who knows what miracles, you can achieve
(You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will
(somehow, somehow, somehow)
Now, you will! (no, no, no )
You will when you believe! (oh)
You will when, you will when you believe, (just believe!) (uh)
(Just believe), you will when you believe!

Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love (Hey)
Gimme your love, gimme your love (You gotta bounce to this like this)
Gimme your love, gimme your love (You almost gotta watch and listen)
Gimme your love (Uh-huh), gimme your love (Woo)
Gimme your love (X-Scape), gimme your love

Boy, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all

Boy, if I do
The things you want me to (Uh-huh)
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby (Uh-huh)
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Gimme your love, gimme your love

Gimme your love (She want), gimme your love (She said)
Gimme your love (Uh-huh), gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love (Yeah, we comin' back)

It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things that you know
Persuade me to relinquish my love to you
But I cannot resist at all

Boy, if I do (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah-yes)
The things you wanna do
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby (Love me, oh)
Or leaving me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

(The start that you'd go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart (Alright, yo)

She wanna shop with Jay, play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi (Uh-huh), rub up in the movies (Uh-huh)
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her mom's
She calls me "heartbreaker"
When we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
Scribble down "I hate ya"
But she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does, and all

(Oh boy, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me (Why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start, (Right from the start that you'd)
You'd go and break my heart (Go and break my heart)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me (Ah)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (Ooh)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start (I should have known)
You'd go and break my heart (That you would go and break my heart)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (Break it down)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Heartbreaker, you got the best of me (Boy, if I do)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (The things you want me to, the way I used to do)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me? (Would you love me, baby)
I should have known right from the start (Or leave me feeling used?)
You'd go and break my heart (Would you go and break my heart?)

Gimme your love, gimme your love (Damn straight)
Gimme your love, gimme your love (That's a wrap)

You took my love for granted
You left me lost and disenchanted
Bulldozed my heart as if you planned it
My prince was so unjustly handsome

Who was that knight in shining armor?
I could've sworn you'd love me harder
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
I ain't the type to play the martyr

How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Get the fuck out

Take your tings and be on your merry way
Fly off with the wind, bye bye baby

Scusa mi, Mimi call you a valet
(You just) take your tings and be on your merry way

My friends all saw it in your eyes
They told me once, they told me twice
I looked beyond all the signs
I guess false love makes you blind, ay

Who was that knight in shining armor?

Stop telling me these lies when you're bluffing
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Go stay at your friend's house or something
Don't mean to be rude, but take your shit and leave

Go stay at your friend's house or something

Go stay with your homeboys you was talking to

It was all so overwhelming
She was like, "I don't know, don't tell me"
He had eyes that said, "Girl, I'll save you"
She had doubts, like they might not make it
So they both held tight to face it
There were vows, she was bound to take 'em
She was full of such trepidation
There in front of the whole damn nation

It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this wrong
He said, "Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong"

Ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn I fucks with you
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm supposed to do (Boy)
Oh baby, I'm in love, it's true
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
Baby, I'm in love, it's true

Waves were breakin' on that shore
As we were sneakin' through that door
Had to leave by half past four
Still I yearned to touch you more and more

It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this wrong
He said, "Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong"

Ooh, I'm in love, it's true

When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I can't pretend these tears
Aren't overflowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me (I will know you're mine)
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly, butterfly (My butterfly)
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly (Fly)
So flutter through the sky
Butterfly
Fly
Spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together
Whoa, oh, no, no, no, ooh
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again, mmm
Ohh

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again (Oh baby, yeah, yeah)
I had a dream, you and me
Will find ourselves in love again, yeah
I still believe (Ooh baby, I do)
Someday you and me (Just give me one more try)
In love again, yeah
I had a dream (I miss your love)
Someday you and me (Mmm, mmm)
Will find ourselves in love again (Ahh, ahh, oh)
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I got myself a lover who knows what I like
When he invites me over, I come every time
And when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go, it's delirium time

He's all mine (I want him, I want him, I want him, I want him)
And his lovin' makes me high (I need him, I need him, I need him, I need him)

Whatever way we go, it's delirium time

When his candy kisses sweetly (I need him, I need him, I need him, I need him)
Caress my whole body (I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him)
All I need is him to be my lover boy (I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him)

Give me more, touch me and touch me

I thank heaven for the things that you do, oh (For the things that you do)
This stuff is starting now, this stuff is starting now

My eyes roll in my head, I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you (Oh, lover)
It's like candy (Candy)
Simply put, you're the reason why (You're the reason why)
Even though I'm real shy (Real shy), it's like candy
I attempt to look my best for you (Indeed you do)
Indeed I do, just for you

Lover boy, come on and love me
Give me more (Give it to me), touch me and touch me

Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby (Y'all know what this is) boy

Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby

(Ah) Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

(Don’t, baby, don’t, baby, don’t, baby, don’t)
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Apparently she got your head all messed up
Now that's the trickery
'Cause you want her to act like you know how this lovin' used to be, uh
I bet she can't do it like me
She'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms (About us)
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us (About us) (Oh babe)
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love (About us)
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us (About us)
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love (About us)
So I hope this will remind you, babe

This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say bye (No, no, no)
Mama's, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye

As a child, there were them times
I didn't get it, but you kept me in line
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings, and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things separation brings
You never let me know it
You never let it show because you loved me, and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today, face-to-face

I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye

Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye

And you never got a chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by (As time goes by)
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye (Oh)

Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (The hardest thing to say, bye)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (Bye)

This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high

This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye

Never knew I could hurt like this (I never knew it)

I wish I could talk to you for a while (I wish)
Miss you, but I try not to cry (I wish)
As time goes by (I wish and wish as time goes by)
And it's true that you've reached a better place

Still, I'd give the world to see your face

Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (It's hard to say bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (So come on, somebody sing it with me)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (Wave your hands up high)
Bye bye (Hey)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye ('Cause this is for my people who just lost somebody)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (So this is for everybody)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (Just keep your head to the sky)

O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine

A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine, yeah
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night divine (O night divine)
Ooh, yes it was (O night divine)
Oh, it is the night of our dear Savior's birth (O night divine)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

When you get caught in the rain
With nowhere to run
When you're distraught
And in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone, it's okay
Once you say

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain

And if you keep falling down
Don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound
So keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
Once you say

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain

And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid
There's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I'll make it through the rain

I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I'll live one more day, and I
I can make it through the rain

Oh, yes you can
Oh, you're gonna make it through the

With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could
Oh yes

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
Oh (Mmm, yeah)

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles
When you believe
(When you believe)
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill (Mmm)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask, uh
And it's easy to give in to your fears, oh (Oh)
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small, but still, resilient voice
Says help is very near, oh

There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Oh, when you believe)
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh)
When you believe
Somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Now you will
You will when you, when you believe, oh

You will when you believe
You will when you believe

Dying inside 'cause I can't stand it
Make up, break up, can't take this madness
We don't even really know why all I know is baby, I
Try and try so hard to keep our love alive
If you don't know me at this point, then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me that unconditional love I used to feel
It's a mistake if we just erase it (Hey, hey)
From our hearts and minds, and I know

We said let go, but I kept on hangin' on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like “Oh well"
Each time you let me down (Front like "Oh well")
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But, baby, baby, I stay in love with you

It cuts so deep, it hurts down to my soul
My friends tell me I ain't the same no more
We still need each other when we stumble and fall
How we gon' act like what we had ain't nothing at all now?
Hey, what I wanna do is ride shotgun next to you
With the top down like we used to
Hit the block proud in the SU
We both know our heart is breakin'
Can we learn from our mistakes?
I can't last one moment alone, although I know

We said let go, but I kept on hangin' on
Inside I know, it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like “Oh well”
Each time you let me down (Front like "Oh well")
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But, baby, baby, I stay in love with you
We said let go, but I kept on hangin' on
Inside I know, it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try and front like "Oh well"
Each time you let me down (Front like "Oh well")
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But, baby, baby, baby, I stay in love with you

I stay in love
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh, love
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I stay
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Love
I stay in love

Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be

[Song 32: Triumphant (Get ’Em)]
19 ContributorsTriumphant (Get ’Em) Lyrics
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)

They told me get 'em, I got 'em
I swear this word to my father
And the only way to make it to the top
If you go and get it from the bottom
And I have never asked for no hand outs
You won’t carry me, no Mariah
These haters love when I was dead broke
But they are not mad at me
I’m on fire and I’m going to burn
And I am not going to learn
I remember they said that it is not my turn
But it is not confirmed, then the tables turned
Just look at me now, try to hold me down
But I am not going to stop, because I’m going to climb
To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let go

Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

Path that I chose flashing camera’s as I pose
Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road
License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred racks she don’t know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell trying to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C, spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain
Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day
Came from humble beginnings
Then was Hummers and Benzes
Now it’s hundred and millions this is only the beginning
A don, a diva, the bomb achiever
The one believer, the game gets deeper

Can’t fall down stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)

Can’t fall down now, so even when clouds surround you
And everyone seems to doubt you
Baby, still know who you are
So you got to keep on climbing
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
It’s not too far

Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toe, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down
Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toe, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)

I got you stuck off the realness
I got you stuck off the realness

It wasn't raining yet
(Yet)
But it was definitely a little misty on
(But it was definitely)
That warm November night
And my heart was pounding
(Pounding)
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time (back in time)
(I go back, I go back, I go back)
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moët and
I started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me in your arms
(You took me in your arms)
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet (so I)
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long long time
(And I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain

Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you, caressing me)
And go back in time (back in time)
(Back)
To relive the splendor of you and I (you and I, you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night

(Every time)
Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you)
And go back in time (back in time)
To relive the splendor of you and I (you...)
On the rooftop that rainy night

Last night I dreamed that I
(Last night I... dreamed that I...)
Whispered the words I love you
(That I love you boy...)
And touched you so very (touched)
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
(Kiss... kiss... bye...)
(Pretty baby - How I'm missing you)

(Every time I...)
Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you, caressing me)
And go back in time (back in time)
To relive the splendor of you and I (I go back)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On the roof that rainy night)

Every time I feel the need (and every time)
(When I feel the need, I envision you)
I envision you caressing me
(Over and over and over again)
And go back in time (back in time)
To relive the splendor of you and I
(It was oh so sweet, you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On that rainy night)

Every time I feel the need (and every time)
(Last night I had the strangest dream...)
I envision you caressing me
(It was actually quite symbolic)
And go back in time (back in time)
(As I whispered... That I loved you)
To relive the splendor of you and I
(...very subtly)
On the rooftop that rainy night

Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time (back in time)
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Weeping may endure for a night
But joy comes in the morning
Trust Him

Somehow I know that
There's a place up above
With no more hurt and struggling
Free of all atrocities and suffering
Because I feel the unconditional love
From One who cares enough for me
To erase all my burdens
And let me be free to

Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need You now, Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of You by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray You'll come and carry me home

Can we recover?
Will the world ever be
A place of peace and harmony
With no war and with no brutality?
If we loved each other
We would find victory
But in this harsh reality
Sometimes I'm so despondent
That I feel the need to

Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need You now, Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of You by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray You'll come and carry me home

He said He'll never forsake you
Or leave you alone
Trust Him

I need You, Lord, I need You, Lord
I need You right here by my side
Lift your head up to the sky
With God's love you'll survive

Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
(I need You, Lord, oh, Lord)
I need You now, Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
(Please don't let the world, the world, the world break me tonight, tonight, tonight)
I need the strength of You by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray You'll come and carry me home
(I pray You'll come and take me home, hey, Lord)

Fly like a bird
(I need, I need You, Lord)
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
(Carry me higher, Lord)
I need the strength of you by my side
('Cause I need the strength of You to survive)
Sometimes this life can be so cold
(Life can be oh, so cold)
I pray You'll come and carry me home
(Oh carry me home, oh carry me home, oh)

Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
(I need you to come and carry me higher, Lord)
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
(Carry me higher, Lord)
Carry me higher, higher, higher
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me home

Why you mad? Talkin' 'bout you're mad
Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?
That’s your bag, yup, that’s too bad
Show is over, you ain't gotta act
Name hold weight like kilos
Boy, you actin' so corny like Fritos
Wouldn’t have none of that without me though
Ain't none of my business, it's tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game, you're a free throw
It's nothing that you don't already know

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity

How I say this? Fact that you still exist
No disrespect, no second thought, it truly, truly is
Truthfully, I'm through with this
Why are we still doing this?
Answer the phone like, "Who is this?"
Take your head and knock some sense
Je ne comprends pas (Ah)
Ain't no compliments (Ah)
Ain't no being friends (Ah)
Ain't no false pretense (Ah)
Ain’t no make amends (Ah)
Ain’t no come against (Ah)
That's the story, ain't no happy ends

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There's an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity

Is it lack of ice got you so cold?
Have you ever felt this on your own?
Why you tryna play like you're so grown?
Everything you own, boy, you still owe

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There's an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity

You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
'Cause I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream

I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream

And you walk in like it's nothing
Hold up, hold up, hold tight
Ain't no donuts, ain't no coffee
See, I know you seen me calling and calling
I should crack you right in your forehead

Let me take a breath (Let me take a breath)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)
If you f'ed up, it's over

'Cause when it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong

My self image, then I'm sorry

But I learned my lesson
Boy, you're sorry (Boy, you're sorry)
Bump, bump, bump all out in the open
Don't make me go call Maury Povich

Let me take a breath (Let me take a breath)

Ladies and Gentlemen...

I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You don't understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey (I don't, I don't)
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey (I don't, I don't)

Somewhere in another life
We stole a moment in time
Gave you everything that you needed
I was even down to repeat it
Said you would always be mine
Feeding me nothing but lies
I was so gone, I admit it
Had me messed up for a minute

But I'm tired of crying, no more tears
Pity party of the year
Cold at night cause you're not here
Leaving you was my worst fear
I was caught up, I was blind
You kept playing with my mind
Told you I'm finished, gassed up the whip and
Rear view, bye

'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back, but I don't (I don't, I don't)
Boy, I was bugging
Thinking somehow I could trust you
See, I used to love you
But I don't, I don't (I don't, I don't)
Boy, I was bugging
Thinking somehow I could trust you
But you don't mean nothing
'Cause I don't, I don't

I tried to make it work
No matter how much it hurt
You had to make it all about you
Tell me why you go and do me like you do
I went from me and you
To walking right out on you
I know you want love, in your feelings
Fronting on me like your love was the realest

And I'm tired of crying, no more tears
Pity party of the year
Cold at night cause you're not here
Leaving you was my worst fear
I was caught up, I was blind
You kept playing with my mind
Told you I'm finished, gassed up the whip and
Rear view, bye

'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had

You just don't trust me
You don't understand me

I know you love me (You love me)
You just don't trust me (You don't trust me)
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey

Uh, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, I just got you a ring, for what?
I put you in the game, now it's game over
Every time you went to the Louis store you got chauffeured
Hold up, how you gon' leave that?
Hold up, give me my ring back
Never mind, you can keep that
'Cause every time you look at your ring, me, you gon' dream that

Lying beside you, here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?
We sailed on together, we drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms
Arms
Yeah, yeah

Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms

I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you

I will give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
'Cause without you beside me I can't survive
Don't wanna try
If you keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby, I'm so thankful I found you

See, I was so desolate before you came to me
Looking back
I guess it shows that we were destined
To shine over the rain, to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel
This way

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
See baby, I'm so thankful I found you
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby, I'm so thankful I found
You
You

I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby, I'm so thankful I found you

[Song 41: Caution]
37 ContributorsCaution Lyrics
Never too late, you can come through
I'll be up waiting
I don't want nobody but you
No hesitating
'Cause every time you leave I fall apart
Boy you're the missing pieces of my heart

And I try to let you go but you resist and pull me back
And I try to be alone but you persist, I've met my match

Proceed with caution, don't be dishonest
I need you closer to love me harder
Proceed with caution, face to face
And touch me in a different kind of way
Proceed with caution, but don't make me wait
Before too long it just might fade away
Proceed with caution, caution, caution, caution, caution

Never get enough gimme your touch
Don't wanna waste time
You lift me up, give me that rush
Tell me it's all mine
I'll give up everything to be right where you are
I'll follow you from here like you're the northern star

And I try to let you go but you resist and pull me back
And I try to be alone but you persist, I've met my match

Proceed with caution, don't be dishonest
I need you closer to love me harder
Proceed with caution, face to face
And touch me in a different kind of way
Proceed with caution, but don't make me wait
Before too long it just might fade away
Proceed with caution, caution, caution, caution, caution

Do you want more material possessions? Ain't nothing
Do you want more? Can you commit to be my everything?
Do you want more? Baby convince me with the words you sing
If you wanna be more to me, you must proceed with caution
Caution, caution, caution
Caution, caution, caution
Caution, caution, yeah
Proceed with caution

Proceed with caution, don't be dishonest (Don't be dishonest)
I need you closer to love me harder (I need)
Proceed with caution, face to face (Proceed with caution)
And touch me in a different kind of way (A different kind if way)
Proceed with caution, don't be dishonest (Don't be dishonest)
I need you closer to love me harder (I need)
Proceed with caution, face to face
And touch me in a different kind of way (Touch me, touch me)
Proceed with caution, but don't make me wait
Before too long it just might fade away
Proceed with caution, caution, caution, caution

62 ContributorsGiving Me Life Lyrics
Hey, baby, what's happenin'? How you doin'?
We can make it, baby, me and you
(Me and you, me and you, me and you, me and you)
It wasn't really, wasn't really
It wasn't really much at all
It wasn't really

So, it's summertime, lil splash a wine
And forget about it
If you're so inclined, let's take a ride tonight
So, then maybe if the stars align
We'll fix our minds on another tangent
And it's kinda like impossible to top this at all

Giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Feelin' myself like I'm Norma Jeane
Here in my arms is where you should be

It wasn't really, it wasn't really much
It wasn't really much at all
It wasn't really, it wasn't really
Wasn't really much at all

Oh, my philosophy
Doesn't quite apply to you and me
But I won't think too much
So, come on and feel my touch
It wasn't really much at all
Just a little sensitivity, yeah that's all
Here in my heart is where you should be
Ooh, you are

Giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Livin' like Babs 'cause it's evergreen
Here in my arms is where you should be

It wasn't really, it wasn't really much
It wasn't really much at all (It really wasn't)
It wasn't really, it wasn't really (The Ruler)
Wasn't really much at all

Wassup, ma? Hush, got fly
Here's a quest, why you left? Was it my messed up eye? Why?
Reminisce, wannabe, huh?
See, hon, followed sheep from once the first chick
Clark Wallabees on (Beep, beep)
Swag, honey drip, spendin' some time
Remember them rhymes?
Your gold fronts looked better than mines did
Was ecstasy, poundin' in the BM
Clownin' me and that was way before wore gowns and the skin'
Givin' me life

Giving me life and it's everything (Mariah Carey)
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Feelin' myself like I'm Norma Jeane (La, la, la-la)
Here in my arms is where you should be (Where you should be)
Ooh, you are giving me life (Giving me life)
And it's everything (Everything)
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
(Thinkin' 'bout when we were)

Here in my arms is where you should be

(Wasn't really, wasn't really)
Here in my arms is where you should be (Right here in my arms)

Giving me life and it's everything

It was a stone groove, my man
You are the most righteous
Yeah, right, just get the fuck out
(Get the fuck out, get the fuck out
Get the fuck out, get the fuck out)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Giving me life and it's all (Giving me life)

46 Contributors8th Grade LyricsMariah wrote this song about her first crush in 8th grade.
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life

That cigarette, put it out, put it out
Keep lookin' my way, turn around, turn around
This is a moment you can't buy
I see that longing in your eyes

Somethin' is tellin' me you're ready, am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me, then I was gone?
Better not be leadin' me on

I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life

I'm a confirmation, should you feel unsure
I'm that security when you're insecure
I'll be that baby girl when you're immature
Don't be ambivalent towards me

Somethin' is tellin' me you're ready, am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me, then I was gone?
Better not be leadin' me on

I need a lover to give me
The kind of love that will last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away, baby
Oh yeah, yeah

I want a lover who knows me
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights
'Till the dawn
Why don't you take me away?

Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby

I don't want another pretender
To disillusion me one more time
Whispering words of forever
Playing with my mind
(No no no, no no, baby)

I need someone to hold on to
The kind of love that won't fly away
I just want someone to belong to
Every day
Of my life
Always
So come and take me away

Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately

I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm need you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do and I feel that you do
Inside

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was so blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there alone

This song is a cover of British-American rock band Foreigner’s 1984 hit “I Want To Know What Love Is.”
I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm colder, hey

In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time (Take a little time)
A little time to look around me (Ooh)
I've got nowhere left to hide (Nowhere left to hide)
It looks like love has finally found me (Ohh)

In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is (Feel what love is)
And I know you can show me
Show me, I wanna know
I wanna know what love is

26 ContributorsCircles Lyrics
Ever since you left me
I've been trying to hide the pain
Painting on a smile with lipstick
Putting on a big charade
So difficult to keep pretending
It's getting harder everyday
It's plain to see I'm cold and heartsick
Since you turned and walked away

I just keep going 'round and 'round
And 'round in circles
Keep on tumbling down

Oh boy, my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around in circles over you
(Running around in circles over you)

Saturday I saw you
Holding hands with someone new
Somehow I kept my composure
Just like everything was cool
But inside I kept repeating
Don't you let them see you cry
So I casually turned my head
As the tears rolled down my eyes

I just keep going 'round and 'round
And 'round in circles
Keep on tumbling down

Oh boy, my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around in circles over you

Everything is you
How can I pull through?
My heart is consumed, I'm so confused
Still caught up in you, love can be so cruel
Baby, don't know how to turn you loose

Oh boy, my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
No, nothing's the same
You got me running around
And running around
And running around
Nothing's the same
Baby, baby, 'cause you
Got me running around in circles over you
(Running around in circles over... you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh
Oh, oh
Oh, mm

Where do I go from here?
How do I disappear?
Here beyond the looking glass
Somewhere off the beaten path
Heartache never seems to pass
Just lasts
And I'd go

Yet I know that tomorrow comes
So I'll be here when you rise
Stay real close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I
Bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
A portrait of my life

La-da-da-da-da-da-da (Yeah)
Da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da (Yeah)
Da-da-da, da

Somewhat desensitized (Mm, oh)
Still the same hopeful child
Haunted by those severed ties
Pushing past the parasites
Down but not demoralized
Unconfined
But don't let go

Yes, I know that tomorrow comes
So I'll be here when you rise (Rise, rise, rise)
Stay here close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I (As I)
Bottle myself up inside (Bottle up inside)
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
This portrait of my life

And for the finale, she can
Float around effortlessly and
Dream away the hours in her mind, ah
And I let go

Yet I know that tomorrow comes (Tomorrow, ah)
So I'll be here when you rise (Rise, rise, rise)
Stay here close and the moment will subside (Moment will subside)
Look the other way as I (Look away, look away, yeah)
Bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight (No, no, no)
Just conceal myself and hide
This portrait of my life

DPG style, ya know? Ya know?
When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby, I cry

Okay, so it's 5AM and I still can't sleep
I took some medicine but it's not working
Someone's clinging to me and it's bittersweet (What?)
'Cause he's head over heels but it ain't that deep (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I finally changed my number, got a different pager
Then last Saturday your cousin called to say you're
Tryin' to reach me
Probably because you see that I'm with someone new

Trying to find relief on the radio (ah, what's up?)
I'm suppressing the tears but they start to flow (Haha)

Is a song I wrote when we first got together
Early that September
I can't bear to listen so I might as well drift
In the kitchen, oour another glass or two
And try to forget you (Ya know? Ya know?), ooh

[Song 51: Clown]
39 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisClown LyricsThe first diss track towards Eminem after he claimed they had a six-month-long relationship and Mariah denied the charges, the second and final being Obsessed.
Yeah, yeah
I guess your momma never told you
What comes around comes back around

I should've left it at "How ya doin'?"
I should've left it at "I like your music too" and
I should've never called you back when you pursued me
I should've never given you my fucking two way
I should've never listened to your woeful stories
The ones I'm sure you told a thousand times before me
You should've never intimated we were lovers
When you know very well we never even touched each other

Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore?
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
(I guess your momma never told you that what comes around comes back around)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
(I guess your momma never told you
What comes around comes back around)

I gotta break it to ya delicately, dummy
Taking my G5 twenty minutes wasn't nothing
But I guess you wouldn't know that's the way I roll
Consequently now your ego's fully overblown
You don't want the world to know that you're just a puppet show
And the little boy inside often sits at home alone
And cries, cries, cries, cries

Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Nobody

Your pain is so deep rooted
What will your life become?
You try to hide it, but you're lost and lonesome
Still just a frail shook one

(Tell me who's gonna love you?)
Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
(I'd like to know)
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
(Who's gonna be there? Nobody, nobody, nobody!)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
(I guess your momma never told you that what comes around comes back around)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
(I guess your momma never told you that what comes around comes back around)

Who's gonna love you when it all falls down and
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
(I guess your momma never told you that what comes around comes back around)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down

[Song 52: Underneath the Stars]
27 ContributorsUnderneath the Stars LyricsUnderneath the Stars was never given an official release. It peaked at #69 on Billboard’s R&B Airplay chart.
Mariah considers the song one of her personal favorites.
One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find

And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)

Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
And I'm so shy (So shy)
A bundle of butterflies
Flushed with the heat of desire
On a natural high

As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart to you there in the dark
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Oh-oh (Young love, young love, young love)

Beautiful and bitter sweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you (Baby, baby, baby)
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good-bye (Oh yeah)
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was drifting

To another state of mind (Drifting, drifting, drifting)
And imagined I was yours and you were mine (My own, baby)
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Lay underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
I was drifting, drifting
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love, young love)
(Young love, young love, young love, young love)
Underneath the stars, baby, baby

[Song 53: Whenever You Call]
13 ContributorsWhenever You Call Lyrics“Whenever You Call” is a song recorded by Mariah Carey for her sixth studio album, Butterfly (1997).
Love wandered inside
Stronger than you
Stronger than I
And now that it has begun
We cannot turn back
We can only turn into one

I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call

And I'm truly inspired
Finding my soul
There in your eyes
And you
Have opened my heart
And lifted me inside
By showing me yourself
Undisguised

And I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call

And I will breathe for you each day
Comfort you through all the pain
Gently kiss your fears away, mmm
You can turn to me and cry
Always understand that I
Give you all I am inside

And I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
I won't ever be too far to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
I'll always remember
That part of you so tender
And be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call, yes

Ooh, whenever you call
Whenever you call

Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Ooh, ooh
La la la
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

Once upon a time, we swore not to say goodbye
Something got a hold of us and we changed
Then you sat alone in pride
And I sat at home and cried
How'd our fairytale just end up this way?

We went 'round for 'round 'til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

I can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off (Still can't shake you off)
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you, break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you (Oh)

Ooh, this was a love phenomenon no one could explain
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind and watch us every night
Wanna pause it, but I can't make you stay (Just gotta let it play)

We went 'round for 'round 'til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye? (Why?)

I can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off (Still can't shake you off)
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you, break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you (Oh)

No need to call my phone 'cause I changed my number today
And matter fact - I think I'm moving away (Away)
Sorry, the frustration's got me feeling that way
And I just keep having one last thing to say
And I just wanna hold you, touch you, feel you, be near you
I miss you, baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)
I'm tired of tryna fake through
But there's nothing I can do
Boy, I can't wait to hate you

I can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off (Still can't shake you off)
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you, break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you, baby

I can't wait to H-A-T-E you
'Cause right now I need you
I can't wait to let you go
I can't wait to H-A-T-E you
'Cause right now I need you
I can't wait to let you go

I remember when you used to be mine
Way back when
I was too naive to love you right
But now if I only had the opportunity
I would do anything
Because my heart still believes

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life, life, yeah

It's irrelevant to dwell on the past, yeah, yeah
I'm accountable for what went bad
And I mean that
But I keep on praying for another chance
Just to have you back
Because I've grown
And I know how to be your everything

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life, life

No, no, it ain't over yet
I just can't accept the possibility
We weren't made for each other's arms
I know you're my destiny
We can't erase what was meant to be
Part of you and part of me
If we try one more time
Maybe somehow we'll survive

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Boy, maybe we could bring it back
Maybe we could bring it back
Maybe we could bring it back to
Life
Maybe you could be mine
Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe

We're all in this together
You're my only hope
And it's too divided, too deep to understand
But if we don't do it, tell me, who will?
Oh, we always say these words that don't mean too much
I wonder, where is the love?
It's curious
The fear still holding us down
One day, will we look up?

You got a right to your own opinion
But when it comes to the world we live in
Isn't it time that we start rebuilding
All of the things that have basically crumbled?
We all tend to forget that
We all cease to exist if
Wе all live for ourselves
If nobody bothеrs to find a solution

If he won't, and she won't, and they won't, then we won't
We won't ever learn to save the day, woah, oh
If he won't, and she won't, and they won't, then we won't
We won't ever learn to save the day

We're all in this together
You're my only hope (Only hope)
And it's too divided, too deep to understand
But if we don't do it, tell me, who will? Yeah
Always say these words that don't mean too much

That fear still holding us back
One day, will we look up?

Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep

But still, I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah

I know life can be so tough and you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on
You'll never find the answers if you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do

Still, I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen (Oh no)
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night and pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen (He's gonna make it happen)
If you believe in yourself enough (If you believe)
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen (Yes, you are)
Make it happen (Make it happen)
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord (You just gotta hold on)
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen

Make it happen, oh-oh, yeah, make it
You're gonna make it, make it, oh, baby
(Oh, oh-oh, oh) Make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And finally found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen (Yes, he is)
If you believe in yourself enough (If you believe)
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen (You can make it)
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)

I once was lost, but now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight and don't let go
You can make it, make it happen, yeah
You can make it, make it happen
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it (You're gonna make it)

(Ladadadada lada lada ladadada ladada dala dala)

I was a wayward child
With the weight of the world
That I held deep inside
Life was a winding road
And I learned many things
Little ones shouldn't know

But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

To grow numb to the madness
And block it away (And block it away)
I left the worse unsaid
Let it all dissipate
And I try to forget

As I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up

Oblivious I almost (Oblivious)
Fell right over (I almost just)
A part of me (A part of me)
Will never be quite able (Will never be)
To feel stable (Able to feel)
That woman-child (That woman-child)
Feeling inside (Feeling inside)
Was on the verge of fading (Practically died)
Thankfully I (Thankfully I)
Woke up in time (Woke up in time, time, time)
(I)

Guardian angel, I
Sail away on an ocean
With you by my side
Orange clouds roll by
They burn into your image (Into your image)
And you're still alive (You're still alive)

As I closed my eyes (You're always alive)
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky (Head to the sky)
And though time's rolled by (Time)
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

It's hard to explain
Inherently it's just always been strange
Neither here nor there
Always somewhat out of place everywhere
Ambiguous
Without a sense of belonging to touch
Somewhere halfway
Feeling there's no one completely the same
Standing alone
Eager to just
Believe it's good enough to be what
You really are
But in your heart
Uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the
Outside

Early on, you face
The realization you don't have a space
Where you fit in
And recognize you
Were born to exist

Standing alone
Eager to just
Believe it's good enough to be what
You really are
But in your heart
Uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the
Outside

And it's hard
And it's hard
And it's hard

Irreversibly
Falling in between
And it's hard
And it's hard
To be understood
As you are
As you are
Oh, and God knows
That you're standing on your own
Blind and unguided
Into a world divided
You're thrown
Where you're never quite the same
Although you try, try, and try
To tell yourself
You really are
But in your heart - uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the outside
You'll always be
Somewhere on the outside

The way it feels to fly
The way it feels to fly
Runway, runway, runway

They'll come a day when we won’t have to fight
Won't be about who was wrong who was right
Like fireflies emanating the light
Just you and I universally tied
There's truth for those if they want to hear
Somewhere out in the atmosphere
To survive gotta persevere
Cause to fly gotta have no fear

First they love you, like ooo it’s just you
And then they bait you and try to change you
You can push through it, stay the same you and
Never let 'em bring you down
Remember there's only one you
And there's a God up above you
You can soar above the hurt when it taunts you
Float like a hummingbird if you want to

Let love be your runway
There is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you're rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race keep kissing the horizon

Runway...
Runway...
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway

There's a band of color that reflects the love you have inside
And you will discover there is solace though you’re terrified
And I promise there is truth for those who really want to hear
If you wanna touch the sky and fly you’ve got to have no fear

First they love you and then they judge you
And try and chain you and then they drain you
You can push through it stay the same you and
Never let 'em bring you down
Remember there’s only one you
And here's a God up above you (True)
You can soar above the hurt when it taunts you
Float like a hummingbird if you want to

Let love be your runway
There is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you're rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race keep kissing the horizon

Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting

'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears

So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
When there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've gotta face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why

You're the only one

So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
So there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've gotta face
Take a good look at me now

I guess I'll just check my machine
Again and again because I'm
Obsessing on you

I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and whisper softly to me:
"You wanna be my babydoll"

Zoning out, thinking about you and me between the sheets
I wanna get intimate, but you're not within my reach
So I'll have a little more wine
And I'll try to drink you out of my head
And I'll lay awake awhile
'Til I'm high enough I can
Forget all about you until
I wake up again

I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and whisper softly to me:
"You wanna be my babydoll"

Slipping into dreams
I feel my love surround you
My subconscious seems
To weave itself around you
Do you care for me?
Beyond idolization
Tell me how you feel
But don't keep me at bay
'Cause I won't be waiting long

I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and whisper softly to me:
"You wanna be my babydoll"
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and cuddle up next to me:
"Come on and be my babydoll"

Still layin' up in bed, it’s 3:27
My body’s lonely
Why ain’t ya callin'?
I’m ready for ya, boy don’t you know it?
Ooooh, you can ring my bell
Ring my bell, my bell
I wanna be your babydoll
Don't you wanna be my babydoll?
I wanna be your babydoll

[Song 66: Petals]
32 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisPetals LyricsThe song describes Mariah’s withering relationship with her older sister as well as her marriage to music producer Tommy Mottola.
I've often wondered if there's ever been a perfect family
I've always longed for undividedness and sought stability

A flower taught me how to pray
But as I grew, that flower changed
She started flailing in the wind
Like golden petals scattering

And I miss you dandelion
And even love you
And I wish there was a way for me to trust you
But it hurts me every time I try to touch you
But I miss you dandelion
And even love you

I gravitated towards a patriarch so young predictably
I was resigned to spend my life within a maze of misery

A boy and a girl befriended me
We're bonded through despondency
I stayed so long, but finally
I fled to save my sanity

And I miss you, little sis
And little brother
And I hope you realize
I'll always love you (I'll always, always love you)
And although you're struggling
You will recover (You're gonna make it, baby)
And I miss you, little sis
And little brother (Whoa, oh)

So many I considered closest to me
Turned on a dime and sold me out dutifully (Sold me, sold me)
Although that knife was chipping away at me (Hey)
They turned their eyes away and
Went home to sleep (Sleep, sleep, sleep)

And I missed a lot of life, but I'll recover
Though I know you really like to see me suffer (Like to see me suffer)
Still, I wish that you and I'd forgive each other (Ooh)
'Cause I miss you, Valentine
And really loved you

I really loved you (I guess I loved you)
I tried so hard
But you drove me away
To preserve my sanity (Mm)
And I found the strength to break away
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Fly

They can say anything they want to say
Try to bring me down, but I will not allow
Anyone to succeed hanging clouds over me
And they can try hard to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams

'Cause there's
There's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me

From me
La, la
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, no
They

Oh, they
They can do anything they want to you
If you let them in, but they won't ever win
If you cling to your pride and just push them aside
See, I
I have learned there's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul that they cannot possess
So I won't be afraid and the darkness will fade

'Cause there's
There's a light in me
That shines brightly
Yes, they can try
But they can't take that away from me

No, oh
They can't take this
Precious love I'll always have inside me
Certainly, the Lord will guide me where I need to go

Oh, oh, they can say
Anything they want to say
Try to bring me down, but I won't face the ground
I will rise steadily sailing out of their reach
Oh, Lord, they do try
Hard to make me feel that I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams

'Cause there's a light in me
That shines brightly, yes
They can try
But they can't take that away from me

From me
No, no, no, no, no, no
Whoa
Mm-hmm

That summer... the summer '88 is the best...
But that's your nostalgia though
"Just for the nostalgia," you gotta say
That's my most nostalgic moment of hip-hop music ever
Right

I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to ya
I won't fool ya, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, all that lovemaking we did, boy
It was so real I wanna feel that again

Long lost friend from way back when
Eric B was president
Tell me where the melody went
And if you still care, say yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing it like I used to do, this one is for me to you, oh

La di da di da di da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
Oh baby you know

I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to ya
I won't fool ya, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, all that love making we did

36 Chambers high
It feels like we’re there, yeah yeah yeah

We just wish it wasn’t full of Draconian, Babylonian, phony men
FOH my summation fascinates, we have debates
Who’s the greatest, living or passed away
I ask MC, see what she has to say
Eric B or Master P, some see it differently
‘87 meant to me? I try to describe it, you try to relive it
I try to revive it, hoping that you get it, yeah
Something about "La Di Da Di" got inside our bodies
Something about "My Adidas" coming out the speakers
Used to do Doo-wop or the Pee-Wee Herman
Rest in peace Heavy D, "Moneyearnin’ Mount Vernon"
Let’s go

I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you said
We could've made everything ok
But we just
Threw the blame back and forth
We treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground

I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces curled on the floor
Super natural love conquers all
'member we used to touch the sky
And

Lightning don't strike
The same place twice
When you and I said goodbye
I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift
But we let it drift
In a storm
Every night
I feel the angels cry

C'mon babe can't our love be revived
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry

Limitless omnipresent
Kind of love couldn't have guessed
It would just up and disappear in
The whirlwind
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope
Wobbling but won't let go
Waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow

I know I can stand just pull me back up
Like there ain't no hurricane
It's just us
I'm willing to live and die for our love
Baby we can get back that shine

'Cause
Lightning don't strike
The same place twice
When you and I said goodbye
I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift
But we let it drift
In a storm
Every night
I feel the angels cry

Come on baby, can our love be revived
Bring it back and we're gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just trying to survive
As the angels cry

Baby I'm missin'
You don't allow love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you

Baby I'm missin'
You don't allow love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you

Lighting don't strike
The same place twice
When you and I said goodbye
I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift
But we let it slip
In a storm
Every night
I feel the angels cry

I can't let go, oh baby
Oooh, oh yea
Oh yea

There you are, holding her hand
I am lost
Dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right?
Don't you know you were my life?

Even though I try, I can't let go
Something in your eyes captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go

Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am, still holding on
I can't accept my world is gone (No, no)

Even though I try, I can't let go
'Cause something in your eyes captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go

Do you even realize the sorrow I have inside
Every day of my life?
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies?
I try and try to deny that I need you
But still, you remain on my mind

Even though I try, I can't let go
(No, I just can't get you out of my mind)
Something in your eyes captured my soul
(I never can say goodbye)
'Cause every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let you go
Even though I try, I can't let go
Something in your eyes captured my soul
(Of something that I need so badly)
Every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go

When I am lost
You shine a light for me and set me free
When I am low
You wash away my tears
And take me through
The loneliness
And emptiness
Through the darkest night
Somehow I survive
Through it all

When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have, I want to give to thee

If I should fall
Your love is strong enough to lift me up
If I'm afraid, oh baby
You chase away my fears
And take me to
A brighter place
Beyond the rain
And I feel alright
'Cause you're by my side
Through it all

And you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have, I want to give to thee

You take me through
The loneliness and emptiness
And I feel alright
'Cause you're by my side
Through it all

You tell me I'm the only one you need

Wanna give you all of my love

You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause, baby, I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
As soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you shoulda have known
Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
Because I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only?
But when your down in your time in need
And you're thinking how you might be coming back to own me
Just think again because I won't need your love anymore

Someday
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, someday
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

12 ContributorsThe Star Lyrics
One dark night
Something said, "Follow the light"
So you look up and see the word
That's written upon the sky
Strong and wise
Keeping the Lord as your guide
And through the doubt, you realize
He's with you all the while

Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas

Shining bright
The spirit of love at first sight
And when the door won't welcome you
Heaven will help you inside
Gathered 'round
Bearing the gifts to the crown
A miracle comes, the babe is born
And angels are heard on high

Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas

Follow that voice you heard that no one else believed
Follow the dream that brought the King on Christmas Eve, oh

Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow the voice, follow the song
Follow the word that makes you strong
Follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star

Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas

Want me to speak on a word or two

Diggin' this track by The Neptunes
Babygirl, follow me to the rest room
Now get buck wild
Shh... don't make a sound
I'll take you, lay you down
Make your body go 'round and 'round
Do you want to?
Don't say you won't, I know you do
Most girls play shy
It won't hurt until you give it a try
I know you like my smile, dig my style
Big bow wow (But uh)

[Song 81: Fourth of July]
21 ContributorsFourth of July Lyrics
Trembling
Starry eyed
As you put your hand in mine

It was twilight
On the Fourth of July
Sparkling colors were strewn across the sky
And we sat close enough
That we just barely touched
While roman candles went soaring above us and baby

Then you put your hand in mine
And we wandered away
I was trembling inside
But I wanted to stay (Stay)
Pressed against you there and leave the world behind
On that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)

So starry eyed (So starry eyed)
On the flowery hillside
Breathless and fervid
Amid the dandelions
As it swept over me (Swept over me)
Like the wind through the trees
I felt you sigh with a sweet intensity and baby

Then you put your hand in mine (Hand in mine)
And we floated away
Delicately lay entwined
In an intimate daze (Daze)
A crescent moon began to shine (Began to shine)
And I wanted to stay (Stay)
Tangled up with you among the fireflies
On that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)

Thunder clouds (Thunder clouds)
Hung around (Hung around)
So threateningly (So threateningly)
Ominously hovering
And the sky (And the sky)
Opened wide
Showering
Oh, yeah, yeah

Then you put your hand in mine (Put your hand in mine)
And we ran from the rain
Tentatively kissed goodnight
And went our separate ways
And I've never truly felt the way that I
Felt that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)

Truly I have never felt the same inside
Like that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)
Truly I could never feel the same as I
Felt that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)

[Song 82: Stay the Night]
16 ContributorsStay the Night LyricsThis song goes over the trials and tribulations of sleeping and sharing an emotional bond with somebody who’s taken.
You're kissing me
And saying I'm the one you need
To keep you warm
And lay with you tonight
Baby I feel the same way
I don't want to leave
Wanna hold you close
And feel your love inside
But I don't wanna play myself
'Cause I know you're with someone else
And I don't need complications in my life
And I don't wanna fall back in
And get caught up in you again
Boy I'm so conflicted in my mind

You keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you
Till the morning light
It's cold outside
And much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost without your love

Obviously, procrastinating just to be
Close to you a little longer now
It's hard for me
To break away from you baby
Never could resist you
And I still haven't learned how
And I don't wanna be a fool
But it's hard when it comes to you
And I'm feeling vulnerable tonight
'Cause I don't wanna miss the chance
Of reliving our sweet romance
Boy, I'm so confused down deep inside

You keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you til the morning light
It's cold outside
And much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost without your love


You keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you til the morning light
It's cold outside
And much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost without your love

Oh, you keep on saying
And you keep on saying baby (stay the night)
And you keep on, keep on, keep on saying baby
(I'm so lost without your love)
And you keep on saying baby baby baby baby, oh (stay the night)
And you keep on, keep on, keep on saying baby (stay the night)
And you keep on saying stay
(Stay the night)

[Song 83: I Wish You Well]
18 ContributorsI Wish You Well Lyrics
This goes out to you and you and you
You know who you are

When glory days turn to stormy nights
You must have been so petrified
— Didn't you? Didn't you feel so cold
You against the world in a losing fight
Captive of your demons inside
So you sought an enemy
— I'm not your enemy, He lives in you, you know it's true
Like times before to mock ignorantly
— But the Lord said love your enemy so just...
Take heed to the word it's time
Check proverbs 19:29 don't cry

I wish you well (I... wish you well)
I wish you well (I... wish you well)
I wish you well

I truly wanted solidarity
Still wearing my blinders back then
— So much I didn't see
I weep for what I dreamed we all could be (I still weep still weep still weep)
I'll keep you in prayer till the end (oh still bruised)
Still bruised still walk on eggshells
Same frightened child hide to protect myself
— Can't believe I still need to protect myself from you
But you can't manipulate me like before (no)
Examine 1 John 4:4

And I wish you well (I... wish you well)
I wish you well (I... wish you well)
I wish you well
— Be strong in the Lord and the power of His might

If my shows of gratitude are minuscule
Inside your mind, sorry
(I'm so sorry, please forgive me)
There's only so much I can do
I love you and I did all that I could
(I did all that I could)

Maybe when you're cursing me
You don't feel so incomplete
But we've all made mistakes
Felt the guilt and self-hate
I know that you've been there for plenty
Maybe still got love for me
But let him without sin cast the first stone brethren
But who remains standing then
Not you not I see Phillipians 4:9
— Put it into practice and the God of peace
Will be with you

So I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
— He who the son sets free is free indeed

No weapon formed against me
Shall prosper
— What time I'm afraid I will trust in the Lord
Surely God is my salvation
I will trust and not be afraid
The Lord the Lord, is my salvation
I will trust in Him
Yes, I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know
But I have had God's help to this very day
And so I stand here and testify to small and great alike
So the more you curse me the more you're blessing me
The word said it
Love your enemies
Do good to those who curse you
Pray for those who mistreat you
Psalms 129:2
They have greatly oppressed me from my youth
But they have not gained victory over me
— in Jesus' name
I wish you well
— He that keeps his mind state on the Lord
— He will keep them in perfect peace

22 ContributorsMelt Away Lyrics
You come to me with a casual flow
And suddenly my defenses start to go
When you talk to me in that sensual tone
It envelopes me and I lose my self control

And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off (I go off)
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

Imagining that you're taking it slow
And so tenderly
'Till the feeling overflows
When you look at me I go soft and cave in
And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening

(Baby...)
And baby I just melt away
(I fall like rain)
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off (I go off)
(Every time I see your face I lose my self control)
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
(And maybe I...)
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

You and me in a cloud of reverie
Spin around inside my head unendingly
(Over and over and over and over)
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Paint pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine

(Baby I... fall)
And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off (I go off)
(Every time I see your face I just go off)
I just want to break it down
(I just wanna break down)
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms
(And maybe I could melt away... oh, your arms, your arms)

And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain (baby I fall)
Every time I see your face I go off (I go off)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah, )
I just want to break it down
(You and me ain't got a typical thing)
Anytime you come around

Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around

I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry, no no

All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing

'Cause I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
Said I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry

Cry...
I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna...
Cry...

Santa
If you get this letter, won't you help me out?
I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how
You do the things you do while I'm 'sleep on Christmas Eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this void inside and I just can't take it

I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night

Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make him mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas night

Oh, Santa
I heard that it's really gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
'Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, ol' Kris Kringle, save me

They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you, Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa, won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night?

Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make him mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas night

Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, Santa
Come on, Santa (Oh, Santa)
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas (Oh, Santa)
Santa gon' come and make him mine, mine
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come and make him mine, mine (Oh, oh, oh)

Oh, Santa Claus
If you get this letter, please don't make me wait
'Cause all December, I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies

The tree's all sparkly and gold
But inside, I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa, won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?

Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho (Oh)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, mine (Santa)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho (Hey)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine this Christmas

21 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisLooking In Lyrics“Looking In” is a song recorded by Mariah Carey for her fifth studio album, Daydream (1995).
You look at me and see the girl
Who lives inside the golden world
But don't believe
That's all there is to see
You'll never know the real me

She smiles through a thousand tears
And harbors adolescent fears
She dreams of all
That she can never be
She wades in insecurity
And hides herself inside of me

Don't say, "She takes it all for granted"
I'm well aware of all I have
Don't think that I am disenchanted
Please understand

It seems as though I've always been
Somebody outside looking in
Well, here I am for all of them to bleed
But they can't take my heart from me
And they can't bring me to my knees
They'll never know the real me

And be brave enough to love again
A place in time still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace

Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
'Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
When I remember

Glittering lights
Incandescent eyes
Still preserved in my mind
In the memories I'll find solace

Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
'Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
And I'll remember

A place in time still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace

Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
'Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
And though we can never be
I'll think of you and me
Always remember love
You're never too far

You need to go
Don't look so surprised
'Cause we had a love that won't be immortalized
Say you need me now
So alone without me now
But our lil romance is through
Because basically boy you
You just don't know what to do

I can give it to you, but what you gonna do
With it if I hit it, I bet you stuck, stoop
But sucking your teeth, don't fuck up my mood
I'm trying to give it all to you
I can understand it's things we go through
Put C's on your bag, let's see this here through
And we can be as high as receipts from Nobu
But I gotta get it out of you
She said "'le' throw a ring on it"
She don't love you unless she put your whole name on it
Gettin' money at this age is hard
Not the datin', I act a way
When all the pretty bitches love you for your stage presence

I miss you almost half as much as you miss me
You used to act so tough, breed insecurity
Now that I found myself you're aching to be mine
Can't even help yourself from playing the fool each night

Ooh... how I loved you
Ooh... how I needed you
Ooh... boy I feel brand new
Ooh... since you turned me lose
Baby

You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do

First you wanna leave
Then you'd never go
I'mma set you free, boy
Baby you don't know

You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do

You love me more than you love sunny summer days
And even more than you love floating in a haze
Boy when you lost my heart, you lost everything
Now all that you can do is listen to me sing

Ooh... how I loved you
(How I loved you boy)
Ooh... how I needed you
Ooh... boy I feel brand new
Ooh... since you turned me lose
Boy

You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do (you don't know what to do)
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do

First you wanna leave
(First you wanna leave)
Then you'd never go
(Then you'd never go)
I'mma set you free
(I'mma set you free)
'Cause baby you don't know

You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
(No baby)

I can give it to you, but what you gon' do
With it, if I hit it, I bet you stuck, stoop
And the motto I got, no class in this school
Take your bags and go boo
Never mind all of the flexin' I do
Balenciagas, got me two steppin' on smooth
Never will I lower my standards, my boo
I could show you where a ten is like Sampras on cue
That’s kinda funny cause love still means lose
Unless we kill a racquet in back-and-forth moves
Somehow you keep showing your Agassi do it
Did you catch it all, screw it
All the girls need is respect and I do it
Never catch feelings cause jets is my fuel
Giuseppe my foot, my sweats be En Noir
So sexy, they ain't sweating me, I bet you ain't know her

You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do

First you wanna leave
(First you wanna leave)
Then you'd never go
(Then you'd never go)
I'mma set you free
(I'mma set you free)
Baby you don't know

You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do

You don't know what to do to me
You don't know what to do to me
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know what to do to me
You don't know what to do to me
You don't know
You don't know
Said you don't know
You don't know

[Song 94: Betcha Gon’ Know (The Prologue)]
24 ContributorsBetcha Gon’ Know (The Prologue) Lyrics“Betcha Gon' Know (The Prologue)” topped Billboard’s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart and #66 on Billboard’s Digital Songs chart.
Whoa, welcome to a day of my life, day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel
Whoa, welcome, welcome, welcome to a day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel

Though the lights were low
I could see you both in a lover's silhouette
And my heart stood still, I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door, jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows just so I could breathe
Can't believe you just actually did this shit to me
I'm going 'bout a hundred, mascara runnin'
Laughing out of anger, but it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you, I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this happen in my own bedroom

Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When I get you back)
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When your heart's been cracked)
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When we fade to black)
How it feels for real

And you see your whole world collapse
And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh
And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh
And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh right in your face, boy
Betcha gon' know though how it feels

So I pulled to the side of the road to fix my face
But I can't cover with make up what my tears want to erase
I wake up in a haze, morning dew and sun rays
As I drive, I hide my eyes behind my black Cavalli Shades
A block from the house slowly creep in the driveway
Tip toe through the door, but you're there wide awake
You're like: "Where you been?"
I'm like: "Sorry, but I fell asleep on Jasmine's sofa
I could've swore that Rae Rae called you and told ya"
You're like: "You okay?"
I'm like: "I'm alright, little sleep and I'll be fine."
But if you only knew what was in the back of my mind
Already stung, but you really gon' find out in time

Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When I get you back)
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When your heart's been cracked)
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When we fade to black)
How it feels for real

This is for real, for real, for real
Oprah Winfrey, whole segment, for real, for real
20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real
60 Minutes, for real

Baby, I had all my trust in you
And look at what you put me through
You got me all crazy
Somewhere down the line, you're gon' get what you deserve
You fucking jerk
You were supposed to save me, my sweet baby
Now we're fading away
But your gonna know how this feels
Even if it's the last thing I ever do
To be continued

[Song 95: When I Saw You]
13 ContributorsWhen I Saw You Lyrics“When I Saw You” is a song recorded by Mariah Carey for her fifth studio album, Daydream (1995).
Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me
Transcending space and time
And I was rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
As I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no one else

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh, when I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same

Only once in a lifetime love rushes in
Changing you with the tide
And dawn's ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark
Wakening you inside
And I thought it was all untrue
Until there all at once I knew

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh, when I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same

With no beginning and
Without an end
You are the one for me
And it's evident
And your eyes told me so
And your eyes let me know

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh, when I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same

Oh no
Never be the same

I'm making a statement of my own opinion
Just a brief little reminder to help myself remember
I no longer live in your dominion
You're just trifling, nothing more than a liability
Got a bundle of your possessions
Outside the kitchen window right now
Letting go

Letting go ain't easy
Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful
'Cause somebody you used to know (know)
It's flinging your world around
And they watch, as you're falling down, down, down
Falling down, baby

Evidently your words were merely lies
Reverberating in my ears
And the echo won't subside
There's a deep deep loss of hope
And the anger burns in me
I hope you don't get no ideas about reuniting baby
'Cause that's the last thing I truly need
Your audacity is too much to be believed, so
Go to Mimi on your contacts, press delete

Letting go ain't easy
Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful
'Cause somebody you used to know (know)
It's flinging your world around
And they watch (watch), as you're falling down, down
Down, down

Baby letting go, baby letting go
Ain't easy, ain't easy
Baby letting go, baby letting go (Woah)
Ain't easy, ain't easy (No)

Baby letting go, it's not easy oh
'Cause somebody you used to know
It's flinging your world around
And you know what? They watch (watch)
As you're falling (falling), as you're falling (falling)
Down
Fall

Can I get your number, baby?
So I can show you what I'm all about?

I've been checking you out
And I noticed that you ain't just one of the crowd
So tell me won't you come over and see about me, baby?
I've got the Cry's on ice, I'm about to get in
Up in V-I-P with all my ladies

Tell me how many times in your life
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight?
Tell me a little something about you
Hear a little something about me
I got a house in Capri and my own G4
And a Benz with the doors that lift up from the floor

Baby, I just wanna hug and kiss and love you
Look into my eyes, baby, don't be shy
Is it yes or no? We ain't got all night!

Tell me how many times in your life
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight?
Tell me a little something 'bout you
Hear a little something 'bout me
I've got a big penthouse with a sick hot tub
We can watch the flat screen while the bubbles filling up

Oh damn! The club 'bout to close in a minute (Ooh)

I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only

I'm riding home in pain again, baby
But that don't mean shit to you
You're currently engaged in an intimate conversation
With a young groupie or two
They say players only love you when they're playing games
Still I gave my heart to you
I should have stayed away-ay-ay-ay
Like my friends all told me to

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?

See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow
Make me sing real high when he goes down low
But see, it ain't just a physical thing
He's gotta treat me affectionately
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust
Just like every other motherfucker does
Is this just an impossible dream, baby?
Too elusive to pursue
It's been such a sad and windy road for me
Just searchin' for the truth

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?

Now you know I'm rolling Beamer and a Benz
And I'm dishing out ends
Why you hating on a play, baller?
Having better conversations while we rolling on twenty four
And I know you got doubts
Why you listen to what people talk about?
You ain't figured out why they call you
The heifer steady hating 'cause you rolling on twenty four
See how you money flow
You dressed in designer clothes from head to the toe
You are not satisfied then tell me what you looking for?
(Mariah Carey: I'm looking for my one and only)
Well, I'll be your one and only
If you give me a chance, I'll make a change for you girl
I know I am not been the most faithful nigga in the world
But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls
Spending to a wallet, fill a Swisha with fire
To kiss you lips, I desire
Twist and Mariah, together like a rim and a tire
(I'm looking for my one and only)
Well, come on Shorty let me make it better
We can do whatever, while we sitting on suede and leather
Feeling through the city while we rolling chrome and
Let's kick it in the Chi
I know I messed up with you, I ain't gon' lie
I knew you was feeling, you really know your guy
But baby girl, I ain't mean to blow your high
Let me pick the pieces up and put them back together
'Cause I want to be with you, don't wanna  leave you lonely
Ride with you like the homie, never no phony
Shorty, can I be your one and only?

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?

I still remember
That hazy September
I've been waitin' for somebody like you
To come back around

We would walk in the park
Every Saturday
Brand new all in love kissin' time away
You was all up on me, it was plain to see
That I was your girl
Way back when it was the simple things
Anklets, name plates that you gave to me
Sweet tarts, Ring Pops
Had that candy bling
And you were my world

Now I wish I could go back
And make time stop
I would take this love
Throw back from the top
Go DJ play my song
And I'm gon' think about you
All night long

Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more
But some days I sit and wish
We was in love again (I wanna go back, back)
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish
We was in love again (I wanna go back, back)
Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you (like candy bling)
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play (like candy bling)
Missin' you my sweet baby
I can't delete your picture from my mind (like candy bling)

It was everything that I could do
To stay away
And I often reminisce about
The games we played
Oh yeah it was tag, chase, spin the bottle
Them butterflies would last
Till tomorrow
Then the lights came on
I had to run right home

And now I wish I could go back
And make time stop
And I would take this love
Throw back from the top
Go DJ play my song
And I'm gon' think about you
All night long

Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more
But some days I sit and wish (boy I wish)
We were in love again (I wanna go back, back)
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again (I wanna go back, back)
Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you (like candy bling)
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play (like candy bling)
Missin' you my sweet baby (my sweet sweet ooh)
I can't delete your picture from my mind (like candy bling)

I'm the same Mimi
Fame ain't changed me
Butterfly flow like Muhammad Ali
Wish I can bring you back like the O.D.B
Thinkin' about the whirlpools
Me you and Jack
No matter what I do
All the memories are stacked
Thinkin' 'bout 10th grade
Thinkin' 'bout 11th
Then you went Dougie Fresh
All the way to heaven

Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more
(Back in the day)
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again (I wanna go back, back)
(I sit and wish we was)
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore
(I wish we was just like back in the day)
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again (I wanna go back, back)
Irresponsible things we would do like
(Still remember)
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you (like candy bling)
(Now I'm back in the, now I'm stuck in the future missing you)
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play (like candy bling)
Missin' you my sweet baby

[Song 101: I Am Free]
19 ContributorsI Am Free Lyrics“I Am Free” is a song recorded by Mariah Carey for her fifth studio album, Daydream (1995).
Once, I was a prisoner
Lost inside myself
With the world surrounding me
Wandering through the misery
But now I am free

You gave me a breath of life
Unclouded my eyes
With a sweet serenity
Lighting a ray of hope for me
And now I am free

Free to live
Free to laugh
Free to soar
Free to shine
Free to give
Free to love
Free enough to fly

Once, I was all so alone
Unsteady and cold
But your love rained down upon me
Washing away uncertainty, yeah, yeah

But now
I am free
I am free

My friend, hmm my love
Faded, oh

It was overcast that day
And I was feeling some kind of way
I pulled the covers up over my head
Tried reaching for you, but that was then
I can’t forget
My heart's hung over but ain't nothing different
I close my eyes, nothing but faded pictures of you, of you...

Faded
Baby you’re faded
Baby you’re faded
Faded

You come and you go
You’re just an echo
A whisper in my ear
But in the morning you’re not here
So intangible
Just like an echo

Still tryin' to pretend it's possible
To bring us back to life
But we continue to subside
Hanging on for life on this rollercoaster ride
I call your name, baby subconsciously
Always somewhere but you're not there for me
Boy you, boy you...

You're faded
Baby you’re faded
Baby you’re faded
Faded

(Boy you just come and you go)
You come and you go
You’re just an echo
(Just an echo, just an echo)
A whisper in my ear
But in the morning you’re not here
So intangible
Just like an echo

Faded
You’re always somewhere but you’re not there for me
Not there for me, not there for me
You’re always somewhere but you’re not there for me
Not there for me, not there for me

(Cry, cry, cry) cry
(Cry, cry, cry) cry
(Cry, cry)

Maybe I didn’t leave much between us that day
And maybe I shouldn’t have told you I loved you
Played the game and now I understand
Wish I could have you back
And kiss you soft and feel your hands on me

'Till we both break down
'Till we both break down
'Till we both break down
And cry
(Cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry)
'Till we both

And maybe I didn’t give you your space back then
And maybe I should have just held out a little bit longer
But I was subdued by you and I didn't know enough
Truly too enchanted to disregard the words you said to make me yours
I need to hold you 'till we both

('Till we both break down)
Break down
('Till we both break down)
I should've known that you would tire of me
('Till we both break down)
Oh, 'till we both break down
And cry

Oh, my love
Imprudently I left every cell in me so naked
Somewhere at the core of you blares our song
I just need you 'till we both

('Till we both break down)
I'm just saying
('Till we both break down)
Might as well tell the truth about the matter
('Till we both break down)
Yes, I guess it's selfish of me to just expect that I'm entitled to have you
('Till we both break down)
But tonight all I wanna do is just hold you 'till
('Till we both break down)
We both break down and cry

Oh, we both break down and cry

Wanna gaze into your eyes forever
Run away and spend our lives together

Could ever replace you in my eyes

[Song 105: Vanishing]
19 ContributorsVanishing Lyrics
If I could recapture
All of the memories
And bring them to life
Surely I would
Hear the distant laughter
Wasn't it you and me
Surviving the night
You're fading out of my sight
Swiftly

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing

I was so enraptured
No sensibility
To open my eyes
I misunderstood
Now you're fading faster
It's suddenly hard to see
You're taking the light
Letting the shadows inside
Swiftly

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're

Reaching out into the distance
Searching for spirits of the past
Just a trace of your existence to grasp
And if somehow I could recapture
All of the memories
And bring them to life
Lord knows I would
But now you're fading faster
Getting so hard to see
Taking the light
Letting the darkness inside
Swiftly

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing
You're vanishing
Drifting so far away

Vanishing
Away

[Song 106: Side Effects]
25 ContributorsSide Effects Lyrics“Side Effects” peaked at #93 on Billboard’s R&B chart. The song is about Mariah’s previous marriage to Tommy Mottola.
It's M.C. and Y.J
Another hit, OK
We lookin' fly, takin' off
Saw us on a runway
On any given Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
They try to confuse me
I never let 'em use me

I was a girl, you was the man
I was too young to understand
I was naive, I just believed
Everything that you told me
Said you were strong, protecting me
Then I found out that you were weak
Keeping me there, under your thumb
'Cause you were scared that I'd become much
More than you could handle
Shining like a chandelier
That decorated every room inside
The private hell we built
And I dealt with it
Like a kid, I wished I could fly away, but instead

I kept my tears inside
'Cause I knew if I started, I'd keep cryin'
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects

Waking up scared some nights
Still dreaming about them violent times
Still a little protective 'bout the people that I let inside
Still a little defensive, thinkin' folks be tryin' to run my life
Still a little depressed inside
I fake a smile and deal with the side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Vacant inside, no one was there
Couldn't be real, had to keep quiet
Once in a while, put up a fight
It's just too much, night after night
After a while, I would just lie
You was dead wrong, said you was right
Did what I could just to survive
Couldn't believe this was my life
Flickering like a candle
Doing my best to handle sleeping with the enemy
Aware that he was smothering every last part of me
So I broke away and finally found the strength to leave

Kept the tears inside
'Cause I knew if I started I'd keep crying
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects

Waking up scared some nights
Still dreaming about them violent times
Still a little protective 'bout the people that I let inside
Still a little defensive, thinkin' folks be tryin' to run my life
Still a little depressed inside
I fake a smile and deal with the side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Hey, hey, hey, let's go)

Hey, magnifical, or should I say magnificent? (Yeah)
Ain't nothing worth your happiness
And I ain't caring who you're with
Misery loves company
So we ain't tryna hang with y'all
Hurt you if you let 'em in
Gotta keep your circle small
Keep tryin' to play apology
I tell him I ain't bowlin' though
Think they want me outta here
I tell 'em I ain't goin' though
Side effects be drowsiness, loneliness
How is this?
I think the call it hateration
What can you prescribe for this?

Forgive, but I can't forget
Every day I deal with this
I live with the side effects
But I ain't gon' let them get the best of me (I forgive)
Forgive, but I can't forget (My)
Every day I deal with this
I live with the side effects
But I ain't gon' let them get the best of me (Hey, oh)

I kept my tears inside
'Cause I knew if I started I'd keep crying
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
(The strength to walk away)
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects

Waking up scared some nights (Hey, hey)
Still dreaming about them violent times (Said I still wake up)
Still a little protective about the people that I let inside (Cryin)
Still a little defensive, thinkin' folks be tryin' to run my life
Still a little depressed inside
I fake a smile and deal with the side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Side effects (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

17 ContributorsLead the Way Lyrics“Lead The Way” is a song recorded by Mariah Carey for her eight studio album, Glitter.
Who would've believed
That you and me would fall
And land together
And who could've foreseen
In you I'd find the place
I belonged forever

And if I move closer
Then love will take over
And lead the way

I'd given up hope
Losing the faith that love
Could be mine to treasure
And now nothing's the same
I found myself reborn
On the day I met you

And if we move closer
Then love will take over
And lead the way

Suddenly you are lying
Here with me and the truths
I used to hold have changed

And if I move closer
And let it take over
Then love will lead the way

If we move closer
And let it take over
Then love will lead the way

16 ContributorsMiss You Most (At Christmas Time) Lyrics
Ooh

The fire is burning
The room's all aglow
Outside the December wind blows
Away in the distance
The carolers sing in the snow
Everybody's laughing
The world is celebrating
And everyone's so happy
Except for me tonight because

I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can't get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season
Comes along and I'm alright
But then I miss you
Most at Christmas time
Ooh, yeah, mmm

I gaze out the window
This cold winter's night
At all of the twinkling lights
Alone in the darkness
Remembering when you were mine, yeah
Everybody's smiling
The whole world is rejoicing
And everyone's embracing
Except for you and I, baby

I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can't get you, no, no, no, no
Get you off my mind
Every other season
Comes along and I'm alright
But then I miss you, oh
Most at Christmas time, oh

In the springtime
Those memories start to fade
With the April rain
Through the summer days
'Til Autumn's leaves are gone
I get by without you
'Til the snow begins to fall and then

I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can't get you, no, no, no, no
Get you off my mind
Every other season
Comes along and I'm alright
But then I miss you
Most at Christmas time
Ooh

Won't you talk to me
This is so out of hand
Something's gone wrong
With the life that we planned

Won't you look at me
You're avoiding my gaze
And it seems like you've changed
In so many ways

It isn't fair
It isn't right
If it's really gone
Then tell me tonight
If it's over
If it's over
Let me go

Won't you speak to me

All I'm asking for
Is for your honesty
Won't you give it to me
Give it to me now

It isn't fair
It just isn't right
'Cause if it's really gone
You've got to say the word tonight
If it's over

Won't you let me know

And they love it when the wristses glow, smother the ring
Slide upon ya strip and go
Just to pick up ya sister bro
You like to pick and choose who she dates
While I state who I like to stick and move
Silly fool, she know that I got her
I'll run up on the strip and go
For Mariah play a brother role
I'll play a different role
Let her roll in the wheel, long days nowhere to go
And no other slimie will do
She just like honey so she got me like Winnie the Pooh
Long nights let her chill with the crew
Only backwoods will do and she know how to roll
They say out with the old and in with the new
But she's my dreamlover so I can't let go, hell no!
Please believe me, I've never been a liar
Touch fire Mariah and Free-weezy

I've got to see you
Wherever you are
And I've got to be there
I'm wishing on stars
I've got to reveal what's inside of my heart
But the words escape me
And I'm paralyzed
So helpless when I
Look into your eyes

And how I wish you only knew
What I feel inside for you
You probably haven't got a clue
But I wish you knew
How I love you, baby
(How I love you, how I love you)

Honestly I know it's silly of me
To want you so badly
But keep it concealed
See my inferiority complex kicks in
And the words escape me
And I'm paralyzed
So helpless when I
Look into your eyes
And how I wish you only knew
What I feel inside for you
You probably haven't got a clue
But I wish you knew
How I love you, baby
(How I love you, how I love you)

I don't know if anybody else outside there tonight
Who knows what it feels like
To want somebody so bad
That nothing and nobody
Can ever seem to fill that void
That is the situation that I'm talking about right now
And if you feel me
Sing the song with me
Come on

And how I wish you only knew
What I feel inside for you
You probably haven't got a clue
But I wish you knew
How I love you, baby

What I feel inside for you
'Cause you probably haven't got a clue

How I love you, baby

Somewhere in the shadows of your mind
Although our love could never be
I find I think about you all the time (Ooh, baby)

Am I in your fantasies?
The way you always wander into mine
And are you longing endlessly?
Just like me deep inside (Oh, baby, baby)

When the nights are dark and cold

And when you're lying all alone

(Do you think of me, do you think of me?)
Am I the one you're dreaming of?
(Do you think of me, do you think of me?)

I picture you embracing me
We drift away and leave the world behind, baby
But it's only make believe
Love can be so unkind (Oh, baby, baby, baby)

When the nights are dark and cold
(Do you think of me, do you think of me?)
And when you're lying all alone
(Do you think of me, do you think of me?)
When you feel the touch of another love
(Do you think of me, do you think of me?)
Am I the one you're dreaming of?
(Do you think of me, do you think of me?)

Hey, tell me, baby (Tell me, baby)
'Cause I need you, baby ('Cause I need you, baby)
Really love you, baby

(Do you think of me, do you think of me?)
When you feel the touch of another love
(Do you think of me, do you think of me?)
Am I the one you're dreaming of?
(Do you think of me, do you think of me?)

'Cause I think about you, baby
When I'm lying all alone, yeah
I think of you
Yes, I do

12 ContributorsHeavenly (No Ways Tired / Can’t Give Up Now) LyricsTrack 14 on “Me. I Am Mariah. The Elusive Chanteuse”. This song is a cover of the Mary Mary song of the same name from their 2000 album Thankful.
Folks will take advantage of you
Because they believe you’re too weak to speak up for yourself
You don’t have to speak up for yourself
Be still and let God fight your battles
Somebody come and go with me, Father

There will be mountains that I will have to climb
And there will be battles that I will have to fight
But victory or defeat, it's up to me to decide
But how can I expect to win if I never try?

I just can't give up now
Come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me

Never said there wouldn't be trials
Never said I wouldn't fall
Never said that everything would go
The way I want it to go
But when my back is against the wall
And I feel all hope is gone
I'll just lift my head up to the sky
And say "Help me to be strong"

I just can't give up now
Come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me

No you didn't bring me
Out here to leave me lonely
Even when I can't see clearly
I know that you are with me
So I can't...

(I just can't)
I just can't give up now
('Cause I've come too far from where I started from)
Come too far from where I started from
(Nobody told me, told me that the road would be easy)
Nobody told me the road would be easy
(But hey I don't believe, don't believe)
And I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me
(To leave me, no)

(Said I can't give up now)
I just can't give up now
(I just can't oh, can't give up now)
(Said I've come too far, too far from where I started from)
Come too far from where I started from
(Nobody told me that the road, not gonna be)
Nobody told me  the road would be easy
(But hey I don't believe, don't believe)
And I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me
(No, no, no, no, no, no, to leave me)

(Sweet Lord carried me through desperation)
I just can't give up now
Come too far from where I started from
(See the Bible says "the Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit")
Nobody told me the road would be easy
(Hey, it's been a little rough but I don't believe, don't believe)
And I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me
(Oh no, no, no, no)

(I can't give up now)
I just can't give up now
(Said I've come too far)
Come too far from where I started from
(From where I started, no one said it would be easy)
Nobody told me the road would be easy
(I said nobody, nobody, told me that the road would be)
And I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me
(Hey, I don't believe... to leave me)

I don't feel no ways tired
I don't believe He's brought me this far
I don't believe He's brought me this far
I don't believe He's brought me this far
(I don't believe He's brought)
I don't believe He's brought me this far
(He, he's brought me)
I don't believe He's brought me this far
(I don't believe, no)
(Be still) I don't believe He's brought me this far
(Hallelujah, no, no)
I don't believe He's brought me this far
(I don't, I don't believe)
I don't believe He's brought me this far

Infamous, it don't stop
Yeah, yeah
Infamous, knock 'em out the box
Yo
I got you stuck off the realness
Infamous, knock 'em out the box
I got you stuck off the realness

It wasn't raining yet
(Yet)
But it was definitely a little misty on
(But it was definitely)
That warm November night
And my heart was pounding
(Pounding)
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time (back in time)
(I go back, I go back, I go back)
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moët and
I started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me in your arms
(You took me in your arms)
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet (so I)
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long long time
(And I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain

Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you, caressing me)
And go back in time (back in time)
(Back)
To relive the splendor of you and I (you and I, you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night

(Every time)
Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you)
And go back in time (back in time)
To relive the splendor of you and I (you...)
On the rooftop that rainy night

Last night I dreamed that I
(Last night I... dreamed that I...)
Whispered the words I love you
(That I love you boy...)
And touched you so very (touched)
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
(Kiss... kiss... bye...)

Infamous rocks the box
I got you stuck off the realness
Feel this pourin' down on your buildings
The rain about to fall
I score up in the project hall
Third floor, grab a taste on the staircase
As we embrace strictly loud without the raw bass
Me and my ol' dog blowin' out the smokes fog
But over all you the one that's like my pistol
I see it crystal
Keep you on my side, you the ficial

Ain't it ill how we click boo, me and you
Got me stuck off the realness
Just me and you
Up on the roof beats
Pebble Beach
Talk to me anytime
Even when I wit my peeps
Ruler L why you smell like the perfume Chanel
Push big G's
Rapper Noyd simply hit me
We can do it on the rooftop
Do it till we both drop
M-O-B-B with Mariah sounds so hot

(Every time I...)
Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you, caressing me)
And go back in time (back in time)
To relive the splendor of you and I (I go back)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On the roof that rainy night)

Every time I feel the need (and every time)
(When I feel the need, I envision you)
I envision you caressing me
(Over and over and over again)
And go back in time (back in time)
To relive the splendor of you and I
(It was oh so sweet, you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On that rainy night)

Every time I feel the need (and every time)
(Last night I had the strangest dream...)
I envision you caressing me
(It was actually quite symbolic)
And go back in time (back in time)
(As I whispered... That I loved you)
To relive the splendor of you and I
(...very subtly)
On the rooftop that rainy night

Every time I feel the need (and every time)
(Infamous, it don't stop)
(Infamous, rocks the box)
I envision you caressing me
(Infamous, knock 'em out the box)
And go back in time (back in time)
To relive the splendor of you and I
(Infamous, rocks the box)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(Infamous, knock 'em out the box)

[Song 117: The One]
8 ContributorsThe One Lyrics
Yo, if you ever been in a relationship
And got hurt really, really bad
This song's for you
I mean, you know what it feel like
(Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)
To not ever wanna do it again
Then you meet somebody
Without a doubt you know they the one
Huh, yeah, but you be so scared and nervous
That you don't wanna get hurt again
(Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)

See, I'm going through a situation that I can't help (Uh-huh)
Wanna get a little closer, but I promised myself
That I would never give my heart away again, ooh, babe
I know it's hard, but ya gotta understand it
The truth is all the hurt and the pain
And the ish that you get when you have it ain't worth it
I've been there so many times
I should know better, but I
Can't stop what I feel when you're next to me
I really think I

Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one (Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)
Finally found somebody that could be the one (Could be)
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared and I'm nervous (Boy, I'm nervous)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one (Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)

See, the problem with relationships in general is that it's always a game
In the beginning, they'll do anything to have you
And once they do, it's never the same (Yeah)
And I know everyone out there can relate (Yeah, you know they can)
So the question is
(One) Do I really wanna trust this feeling?
(Two) Do I wanna let it pass me by?
(Three) Do you think it's only superficial?
(Four) Could it actually be different this time?
Someone to love me, someone to be my everything
Maybe I've stumbled upon

Finally found somebody that could be the one (The only one)
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love (No, no)
And I'm scared and I'm nervous (I just don't)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one (Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)
Finally found somebody that could be the one (Maybe I found)
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love (Yeah, yeah)
And I'm scared and I'm nervous (Boy, I'm so scared)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one (Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)

Oh, baby
Sweet darling
I, I think I finally found (Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)

Finally found somebody that could be the one (The only one)
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love (Baby, no)
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad (I don't wanna be hurt)
'Cause I know that you're the one (Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)
Finally found somebody that could be the one (Finally found)
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love (I promised myself)
And I'm scared and I'm nervous (Boy, I'm nervous)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad (This is bad)
'Cause I know that you're the one (Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)
Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared and I'm nervous (I'm scared and I'm nervous)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad (Yeah, baby, baby)
'Cause I know that you're the one (Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)
Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one (Now MC, baby, tell 'em what we talkin' about)

27 ContributorsMigrate LyricsMigrate peaked at #92 on the Billboard Hot 100 & also charted on Billboard’s Pop 100 chart and R&B chart.
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
Keep it movin' bounce, hey (Danja!)
Keep it movin' bounce, hey (T-Pain!)
Keep it movin' bounce, hey (MC!)

Once again, nothin' jumpin' up in your place
Sick of your Berry buzzin' all in my face
Way too much to tolerate
Time to roll, y'all know I gots to migrate
Speed-dial connecting me to Rae Rae (Hey)
Click in Shawntae and Mae Mae (Hey)
"Treat it as a holiday," 'cause he's a wrap
Y'all know I had to migrate

So, I'm on my way home
'Cause my jeans, yeah, they fit, but it might benefit
Me to throw somethin' on
To feature my hips, accentuate my ass, and steal the show

Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "yo"
Tryin' to get us goin' off that Patrón
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If your neck and your wrist coordinate
Hair braided or faded, okay
We can move this back to my place
It's time to migrate

From my car into the club, we migrate (Migrate)
From the bar to VIP, we migrate (Migrate)
From the party to the after party, migrate (Migrate)
After party to hotel (Migrate)

As we proceed getting buzzed the envious ones
Hatin' but they can't take their eyes off us
But we don't see none of that, they playin' my jam and the floor is packed
See, ya'll need to migrate up out the door
We're clinkin' glasses, compliments of the club
We raise their status, so you know they show us love
Everywhere we go, they gon' flock
Them boys migrate to where it's hot (It's hot), it's, it's

Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "yo"
Tryin' to get us goin' off that Patrón (No)
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If you're inked up thuggin' that swag I like
Face, body and Lamborghini outside
Obviously, boy, you qualify
Otherwise migrate (Bye)

From my car into the club, we migrate (Migrate)
From the bar to VIP, we migrate (Migrate)
From the party to the after party, migrate (Migrate)
After party to hotel (Migrate)

This is where it begins and ends at the very same time
Teddy Pain, the main man of the hour
Got a flow that'll flat your tire
Got stacks, plus I'm back with Mariah
We stay down like four flats on a Cadillac
Packed to the back with four fat girls
If you feel like doin' a dance, I'm gonna pull up my pants
C'mon back, girl
But I gotta migrate to the bar, from the bar to the floor
From the floor to the car, from the car to the crib
Then back to the club, we can migrate in that
Mini Coupe sitting on dubs
Ooh, whatcha waitin' on? I can't stand in one place
I'm on a Platinum Patrón and I hate when I don't get it my way
So don't wait for me to buy drinks or you gon' dehydrate
It's time to migrate, yeah

Soon as I walk through the door (Hey)
They know I'm from the 8-5-0 (Hey)
I need three bottles of that Patrón
I can make the Chevrolet creep so slow
If your ass and your titties coordinate  (Hey)
Shawty, shawty, look it ain't okay (Okay)
We can move this back to my place
Shawty, best believe, it's time to migrate

Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "yo" (Like "yo")
Tryin' to get us goin' off that Patrón (Tryin' to get control of that Patrón, oh whoa)
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If you're inked up thuggin' that swag I like (Thuggin' that swag I like)
Face, body and Lamborghini outside (Oh-oh-oh, oh whoa)
Obviously, boy, you qualify (Oh-oh-oh, oh whoa)
Otherwise migrate, bye (Oh-oh-oh, oh whoa)

Keep it movin' bounce, hey
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
Keep it movin' bounce, hey

Baby, don't tell me you miss me, you love me
Don't whisper gently that you can't forget me tonight
Tonight
'Cause I've heard it all before
Just turn away, don't play that game
Baby, I don't want to anymore

Let it all fade away
Don't you know the love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same, baby
No, no, no

Don't tell me you're sorry you hurt me
How many times can I give in?
How many battles can you win?
Oh, don't beg for mercy tonight
Tonight
'Cause I can't take anymore
Just turn around, don't break me down
Baby, I don't love you like before

Nothing ever stays the same, baby
Oh, oh

So hard for me to let you go
Don't leave me standing in the cold
Oh baby, give it one more chance
I know that we can make it last

Just let me love you one more time
'Cause I don't wanna lose my mind
So hard for me to let you go
So hard for me to let you go

Let it all fade away (Why don't you?)

So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp
When you're fading fast it seems
You know you're slipping away from me

I keep on reaching and I
I keep on trying
But you never even hold me
And it seems like you don't know me, baby
I keep on yearning and I
I guess I'm learning
That it's just a losing fight
'Cause there's no passion in your eyes

So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
Slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away
Slipping right out of my grasp
When you're fading fast it seems
You know you're slipping away from me

I keep denying that our
Our love is dying
But it's all a big charade
And it's a fruitless game to play
I can't remember when you
You last were tender
And it's always touch and go
The silence chills me to the bone

So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away

Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try, but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me (You're so far)
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try, but you're so aloof (Baby, baby, baby)
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me (You're so far)

So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
Slipping away from what we had
Truly, I just don't understand (You're so far)

You know you're slipping away

I've been waiting for someone to come into my life
Who would bring me joy and give me pleasure
I have taken chances on romances once or twice
And I found that in my heart it's you I treasure

You and only you can make me feel the way I do
You and only you can make it better
You and only you can do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and that's forever and ever

All my life my love's been waiting for you
All my life my heart's been waiting too

All my, all my, all my life

I've been wishing on a star, I've been praying on my knees
I've got some sly and sexy tricks to show you
Most of all I'll give you anything boy that you need
To keep you right here by my side, I know you, I'll show you

You and only you can make me feel the way I do
You and only you can make it better
You and only you can do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and that's forever and ever

For the record, you oughta know
You wasn't thinking when you let me go
But whatever, that's how it goes
Win some, you lose some, and others you hold in your heart
Why it gets so hard, tears you all apart
Even though you try to let go, no, no, no
Suddenly you're here, and it's all surreal
And I don't know what the deal

'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (One time)
Like back in the day, that look on your face
Feels like, the first time

Them other regularities, they can't compete with MC
The whole entire world can tell
That you love yourself some me
People see you now, asking all about me
And how they always thought we were so perfect together
Let's rewrite the end, start over again
And it's gon' go better now

'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (One time)
Like back in the day, that look on your face
Feels like, the first time

For the record (For the record)
You'll always be a part of me, no matter what you do
And for the record (For the record)
Can't nobody say I didn't give my all to you
And for the record (For the record)
I told you underneath the stars that you belong to me
And for the record (For the record)
It's obvious that we just can't let go of us, honey (Oh no, oh)

'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time (Oh)
Give me one good reason why (Give me one good reason)
We can't just press rewind (Why can't we just press rewind?)
I don't wanna spend my life (Don't wanna spend my life)
Thinking what it could've been like

Let's talk about love, Let's talk about love
Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
This is my love story (Ya'll know who it is)

Boy meets girl and looks in her eyes (Oh)
Time stands still and two hearts catch fire (Uh-huh)
Off they go roller coaster ride
Up and down and around, twisted all out they minds
And then his friends
Said, "It's too soon to settle down"
And then her friends
Said, "He's a playa, slow it down"
They couldn't be who they was
'Cause it just seemed like love
Wasn't on they side

But this isn't just another love story (Nope)
Together we'll make history (Uh-huh)
I know because it's just too real
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up like that Casablanca movie (No)
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction, this is truly (Uh-huh)
Ours for all eternity
They'll be no end to our love story, baby (Holla at 'em, MC)

Ay bay bay, it won't end, won't end, won't end

Chapter two
When they meet up again
Second time around
See that they're just friends
But the feeling's still strong
And it's been too long
To be trippin' like they ain't been missing
They on the phone like "Ay bay bay" (Hey, hey)
Let's meet up today
Gots about an hour or two
You might as well come through
We can make like it was (Yup)
Just the two of us
Back up on that roller coaster
Like we been supposed to

'Cause this isn't just another love story (No)
Together we'll make history uh huh
I know because it's destiny
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up like that Casablanca movie (No)
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction this is truly
Ours for all eternity
They'll be no end to our love story, baby

Just when it seemed like all the odds were stacked against them
They came back stronger than before, matter fact than some
Stronger than pride, looking like them
Looking like her, looking like him
Stronger than hate and the whole world too
Looking like me, looking like you

'Cause this isn't just another love story (Oh)
Together we'll make history
I know because it's destiny
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up like that Casablanca movie (No)
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction this is truly
Ours for all eternity
They'll be no end to our love story, baby

Ay bay bay, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Ay bay bay, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Ay bay bay, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Ay bay bay, it won't end, won't end, won't end

Do, do, do, do
Woo, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh, woah
Dooba-do, do-do, do, yeah

We've known each other for a long, long time
But I never really noticed all the magic in your eyes
I've been around you a thousand times before
And you've always been a friend to me
But now I'm wanting more

I must have been so blind
I never realized
You're the one that's right for me
All the while I couldn't see
And now I feel so strange
I'll never be the same
I'm going 'round and 'round in circles
And I don't know what to do 'cause, baby

I've been thinking about you (Oh, yeah)
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly, I think I'm falling in love with you

There's no explaining how I feel inside
I'm going through a transformation that's so hard for me to hide
I had a revelation that finally opened up my eyes
The one I spent a lifetime searching for was right here all the time

I was oblivious
So very out of touch
All the while I couldn't see
You're the one that's right for me
And now my world has changed
I'll never be the same
I'm going 'round and 'round in circles
And it's all because of you, sweet baby

I've been thinking about you (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
In the most peculiar way (In the most peculiar way)
I've been thinking about you (Really got you on my mind)
It's unbelievable to me (It's unbelievable)
But suddenly, I think I'm falling in love with you
I've been thinking about you (Baby, baby, baby)
In the most peculiar way (In the most peculiar way)
I've been thinking about you (Got you on my mind)
It's unbelievable to me (It's unbelievable)
But suddenly, I think I'm falling in love with you

Don't you know that you're blowing my mind?
What you do to me, I can't describe (No, no-no, no, no)
Baby, I can't hold back anymore
I just can't conceal it
You're the one I really adore, oh, woah, woo-hoo, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

I've been thinking about you (Oh, oh)
In the most peculiar way (In the most peculiar way)
I've been thinking about you (Oh, really got you on my mind)
In the most peculiar way (In the most peculiar way)
I've been thinking about you
(I've been thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' 'bout you, oh)
In the most peculiar way
(I've been thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' 'bout you, about you)
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly, I think I'm fallin', I'm fallin' (I've been thinking about you)
Baby, I've been thinking about you (In the most peculiar way)
I've been thinking about you (Oh, all and all about you)
It's unbelievable to me (Yeah, to me)
But suddenly, I think I'm fallin, I'm fallin'
In the most peculiar way (In the most peculiar way)
I've been thinking about you (Yeah, yeah)
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly, I think I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
With you

Steady feenin' for you like them fries at McDonalds

How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears

You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
When there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've gotta face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why

You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
When there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
Said there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've gotta face
Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
That's the chance I've gotta take, yeah

Oh
Take a look at me now

Baby

I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don’t, just let me go

'cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
Oh, the last one I had
Made me cry
Oh so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
'cause it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Who is that teacher?
I'm the student
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Boy I'm just gonna say goodbye
You are my teacher
You are my leader

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher
There are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh, so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
'cause there ain't no joy
Just an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try

I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try

Y'all know what this is (Y'all know what this is)
So So Def (Ha, I ain't even gotta say it)
And your girl, Mimi
Thanx 4 nothin' (No, no, nothin')
You were just playing a game (MC)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh)
Thanx 4 nothin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah)

You were just playing a game

"I can't even know what to say"
I've been hurt, I've been played
("I can't even know what to say")
And I'm so ashamed
I can't even cry, it's that deep
You just lie and you cheat
Like it's nothin' (It's nothin')

See, you said that you loved me too, and so I trusted you
But I guess that subconsciously I knew
But I didn't wanna face the truth (Uh)
That I was only being used (Uh-huh)
And you were just frontin'
Ayy boy, thanx 4 nothin' (Say what?)

I never knew enough about you, babe
And I guess I only have myself to blame
Now I'm broken-hearted and shattering
But you were just playing a game
Nothin' (Nothin') anyone could do to convince me, babe
I was living in a lie, just a masquerade
Now I only know that I'll never be the same
But you were just playin' a game (Sing with me)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Thanx 4 nothin' (Uh-huh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh (Uh-huh)
You were just playin' a game

Every day and every night, I stay by the phone (Uh-huh)
Never go no place, so just in case you call, I'll be home (Oh)
Seems like all I do is think about our pseudo romance
While you're somewhere burnin' diesel in the streets havin' laughs

Somebody say you know what I'm going through
You've been left with nothin'
Too much you can't count on one hand (Uh-huh)
Sing it: three, four, five, six
Seven days a week, you're drowning in tears (Oh)
He was so insincere
Now you're laying up in bed every night singing
Ayy boy, thanx 4 nothin' (Yup)

I never knew enough about you, babe (Uh-uh)
And I guess I only have myself to blame
Now I'm broken-hearted and shattering
But you were just playing a game
No, nothin' (Yeah)
Anyone could do to convince me, babe
I was living in a lie, just a masquerade
Now I only know that I'll never be the same

But you were just playing a game

Didn't I need you madly

Where I've been

Do I fit in
Make believing
Is hard alone
Out here on my own

We're always proving
Who we are
Always reaching for
That rising star
To guide me far
And shine me home
Out here on my own

When I'm down and feeling blue
I close my eyes so I can be with you
Oh baby, be strong for me
Baby, belong to me
Help me through
Help me need you

Until the morning
Sun appears
Making light
Of all my fears
I dry the tears
I've never shown
Out here on my own

But when I'm down and feeling blue
I close my eyes so I can be with you
Oh baby, be strong for me
Baby, belong to me
Help me through
Help me need you

Sometimes I wonder
Where I've been
Who I am
Do I fit in
I may not win
But I can't be thrown
Out here on my own

Out here on my own

Hypnotize like Biggie
But you ain't havin' dreams (I'm that chick you like)
Nah, you ain't seeing things

In the sky, let's fly high
Boy, I got you caught up inside of my haze
And you're gonna be gone for days

You're fiendin' to blaze up and taste me
Got flavor like ice cream

And you know you need this man
And you know I got this man
Gonna be your everything

Boy, just relax and unwind
Pull me in and breathe
Once you do
There ain't no rules, it's up to you (Ain't no rules this time)
Just keep on kissin' me
Hold on, and baby, we
Can party all night, through the night, all right

I'm like that ooh-wee
You're fiendin' to blaze up and taste me
Got flavor like ice cream
'Cause I'm that chick you like ('Cause I'm)
And you know you need this man
And you know I got this man
Gonna be your everything

I'm like that uptown haze
Them real thugs blaze
We'll touch the sky
'Cause I'm that chick you like

[Song 136: When Christmas Comes]
9 ContributorsWhen Christmas Comes Lyrics
The whole world feels a little bit more love
When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes
And everywhere that you go
There's people singing "Let It Snow"
And hanging up that mistletoe

And me and you gonna have ourselves a holiday
And we don't need nobody else to celebrate
And we gon' kiss our worries and our cares away
I can't wait

Because this Christmas time, get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
And baby you're the one special treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
Until Christmas comes

So many souls hurt
So many don't have enough
When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes
But baby if you spread love
Someday it might be enough
To heal each other one by one

And we gon' get together and rejoice and pray
And we gon' help the world become a better place
And we gon' sing and shout because the Savior reigns
So don't dismay

Because this Christmas time, get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
Because this gift of love lasts forever
The Lord makes our hearts open up
Soon as Christmas comes

It's gon' be alright
When Christmas comes
Oh, jingle all the way
Oh what fun

And we gon' reminisce about the good old days
And we gon' laugh together as the children play
And through the years it's always gonna be this way
Come what may

Because this Christmas time, get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
And baby you're the one that I treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
When Christmas comes

[Song 137: Camouflage]
17 ContributorsCamouflage LyricsCarey holds nothing back vocally here on this ballad about keeping her pain hidden as a love affair falls apart. From the calling-all-dogs high notes to the sustained notes, it’s all here.
(Camouflage)
(Oh say it)

I remember so many nights in the bed alone
Wondering could I muster the strength to exist in the bitter cold
But you showed up once in a while, I guess that's all right
'Cause I told my heart that you needed time for yourself, it's fine

I camouflage my tears
And you wear your disguise
And 'round I go
To know that you still love me

I need to know, say that you do
(To know if you still love me)
I need to know, say that you do
(Please)

Wear it sometimes when I tried to discern our reality
Wish that I just could be somebody else if you talked to me
Kept praying inside "Let him love me for who I am
Please, my Lord"
But you were just somewhere that I couldn’t reach, couldn’t understand
(All that I needed was you to really see me)

I camouflage my tears
And you wear your disguise
And 'round I go
To know if you still love me

I need to know, say that you do
(To know if you still love me)
I need to know, say that you do

No, didn't we swear we'd give each other everything?
(Didn't we swear I shouldn't hold in on love?)
Didn't I give you all of me?
No, not a day goes by
When I don't wonder inside If you feel the way you used to feel
I camouflage my tears
(I hide every tear inside of me)
And you wear your disguise
And 'round and 'round I go
(To know if you still love me)

I remember many nights I camouflaged
I pray that you still love me
Tell me that you still love me
That's all I really wanted
I cry and cry as you laugh and laugh at the question
But I need to know

I never thought (Who would've thought, baby?)
That I'd be (Missing you, baby)
Without you (I need you, baby)
Why me? (Why me?)

Love, want your body next to me
On me actually off that ecstasy
Reminiscing how we used to smoke and freak
(Fuck) and fall asleep, lockin' for a week
Now we barely even talk and walk the block
Kiss and cuddle up
Girl, we're losing touch
What's a man to do but go crazy, babe?
I know you're mad but you don't really hate me, babe
It's deeper than that

And baby, if we got together again
Sugar, I would be your very best friend
(I'd be your very best friend)
I would love you unconditionally
You'll never want to let me go, baby
I promise I will be by your side (side)
I'll give you anything you need to get by
(What you need to get by)
Then my broken heart will finally mend
Baby, if we got together again
(Baby, if we got together again)

Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend
What if I had a chance to do it all again?
Sometimes for happiness we hesitate
Just like the game, I hear the love won't wait
What if I had another best friend? (another best friend)
What if I had someone on whom I could depend? (me)
Someone who makes me feel like you used to (like you used to)
Tell me, babe, what would you do? (would you do?)

I'll give you anything you need to get by
Then my broken heart will finally mend
Baby, if we got together again (Why me?)

Why would you wanna go
Through the pain of loving another man?
The truth is nobody can love you like I can
It's a damn shame we can't get along
We used to get it on, where'd it all go wrong?
I admit the flesh is weak, but the game is strong
We go my way, your way, baby, we moving on
It's true, gon' miss you
Who would've thought I'd be without you?

I never thought (Baby, there's nothin' to lose)
That I'd be (You know my soul's so cold)
Without you (And my love is pain)

15 ContributorsThe Impossible Lyrics
We were two little people wrapped up in this big old world
Drifting round in space out of place just a boy and girl
Then you took my hand and made me a part of you
And I looked in your heart
And saw all my dreams come true

You did the impossible
You rescued my love
You did the impossible
See, I had almost given up

And now I love ya like summer time, love ya like cherry wine
Love ya like free money, like a preacher loves Sunday
Love ya like freeze pop, love ya like a milk shake
Love ya like a high school girl on a first date
Love ya like shootin' stars, love ya like a muscle car
Love ya like we're destined
Love ya like my lover and my best friend
Yeah, you did the impossible

Tonight I'm gonna need all your attention
Close the door
I wanna do things I probably shouldn't mention
Like a bird I'm gon' hum
Those three words, I love you, I love you, I love you
Freeze the time, let the world go by
If you're mine say, you love me, you love me, you love me
Boy take my hand and make me a part of you
And the love that you gave to me has pulled me through

You did the impossible
You rescued my love
You did the impossible
See, I had almost given up

And now I love ya like sunsets, bubble baths on the jet
Love ya like Kool-aid, Louis Millionaire shades
Love ya like sugar daddys, love ya like a pimp caddy
Love ya like a holiday Duncan Hines yellow cake
Love ya like it's 5 am and I'm off work
(Okay so it's 5 am...)
Love ya like Louboutin heels and a mini skirt
Love ya like an Asscher cut pink and white engagement ring
Love ya like layin' in a bed bumpin Jodeci

And I'm forever your lady
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
And I'm forever your lady
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
And I'm forever your lady
(I love you like the sunsets in the evening)
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
(Like the shooting stars)
And I'm forever your lady
(Yeah, I love you)
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
(Oh, you did the impossible)

I'd almost given up

12 ContributorsAlways Be My Baby (Mr. Dupri Mix) Lyrics
I got one for the money
I got two for the bass
I got three to get you goin' baby
'Cause Da Brat's in the place
And it don't stop, uh, and it don't quit
Yeah, like that, uh, and it don't stop
And it don't quit like that

We were as one, baby
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you wanna be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, baby
Our love will never die, np

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh, darling cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby

I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If your determined to leave, boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably, you'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, baby
Our love will never end, no, no

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby

I know that you'll be back, boy (No, no)
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
(When your days and your nights get a little bit colder)
I know that you'll be right back baby
Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time

Who brings the ruckus and the pain like Meth?
It's evident, the residents of So So Def
Got the industry on lock where outsiders can't enter
Ever since the arrival of this Westside representer
Who rocks your Music Box and breakdown your structure
You fantasize as you visualize me as your Dreamlover
(Fuck) with your emotions unplugging your daydream face Reality
Reason through MC's, Inflicting fatalities
Ain't no cap on my salary, I'm gettin' G's
If you heard of me's, then you know that we's makin' G's
Let's Xscape with Mariah Carey and me to the bank
Steady stackin' papers, smokin' on fat sacks of danks
See, to some I'm a hero, others feel I'm foul, but that's my style
And they don't pay me, nor can they fade me
So what I do is keep it true and real for my peeps in the street
'Cause to them, I'ma always be they baby

May we always be together
In the sands of time
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
And it don't stop, uh, and it don't quit

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
You and I will always be
You and I will always be
You and I will always be
No way you're never gonna shake me
No way you're never gonna shake me
You and I - we'll always be

A broken man without a home
Desperate and so alone
A victim of society
No one really wants to see

Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we just help each other?
Isn't there enough to share?

There's got to be a way
To connect this world today
Come together to relieve the pain
(There's just got to be a way)
There's got to be a way
To unite this human race
And together we'll bring on a change (Bring on a change)

In another land they still believe
Color grants supremacy
I don't understand
How there can be
Regulated bigotry

Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we accept each other?
Can't we make ourselves aware?

There's got to be a way
To connect this world today
Come together to relieve the pain
(There's just got to be a way)
There's got to be a way
To unite this human race
And together we'll bring on a change (Bring on a change)

And maybe then the future will be a time
Without war, destitution and sorrow
And hungry children won't have to die
If we work together today
We'll save tomorrow
Come on, come on

Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we just love each other?
Isn't there enough to share?

Come together to relieve the pain (The pain, the pain)
(There's just got to be a way)
There's got to be a way
(To unite this human race)
And together we'll bring on a change
(There's just got to be a way)
(There's got to be a way)
(To connect this world today)
There's got to be, there's got to be
There's got to, got to, got to be a way
(There's got to be a way)
(To unite this human race)

[Song 147: Prisoner]
18 ContributorsPrisoner Lyrics“Prisoner” is a song recorded by Mariah Carey for her self titled debut studio album.
You don't think that I'll be strong enough
No, baby now
I won't be the prisoner of your love
(Prisoner of your love)

Maybe you don't think that I'll be strong enough
But I'm not gonna be a prisoner of your love
I know you're lying, denying all of your actions
So listen up cause here's my reaction

Here comes the night
No more living in the shadow of your love
This is my life
You always tried so hard to keep me down, but now I'll rise above
Those empty lies
Stop pretending that my accusations take you by surprise
I've realized
Now I'm ending all the secrecy, I see through your disguise

All the dreams we planned
I believed so I held on, I understand
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone

You don't think that I'll be strong enough
No, baby, no
I won't be the prisoner of your love
(Prisoner of your love)

No longer blind
I can focus on deception used to keep me by your side
I read your mind
Don't believe it's all a mystery, there's nothing you can hide
It's all defined
There's nothing you can tell me now to change the way I feel inside

All the dreams we planned
I believed so I held on, I understand
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone

You don't think that I'll be strong enough
No, baby, no
I won't be a prisoner of your love
(Prisoner of your love)
I'm just not the girl you thought I was
(Not gonna be a prisoner)
I won't be the prisoner of your love
Of your love

(Don't wanna be a prisoner, I don't wanna be a prisoner)
No
(Don't wanna be a prisoner, I don't wanna be a prisoner)

So if you wanna be my love you can't be a liar
Play around, you see me and then say
"Mariah, I miss you"
Expect me to hug and kiss you
Don't mean to diss you
But I guess I'm not the kind of girl you thought I was
I've had enough and now I'll see you later 'cause
Boy, maybe you don't think that I'll be strong enough
But I won't be the prisoner, baby, of your love
(You don't think)
No more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more

No, no, baby, now
I won't be the prisoner of your love
(Prisoner of your love)
I'm just not the girl you thought I was
(Not gonna be a prisoner) Not gonna be
I won't be the prisoner of your love

I'm not one of those girls who'll wait around
Crying 'cause you're playing dirty all over the town
You can't do that, I'm not a doormat
You're just a player, that's not my format
See ya
(Prisoner of your love)

[Song 148: Long Ago]
14 ContributorsLong Ago Lyrics“Long Ago” is a song recorded by Mariah Carey for her fifth studio album, Daydream (1995).
Once upon a time you whispered softly in my ear
Loving words, and fairy tales that I longed to hear
I gave you my body and soul and you took control
As you slowly swept me up and carried me away

You told me pretty lies
As I held onto you tight
You knew how to get your way
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace

Long ago
You used to want me
Now it's all so far away (now it's all so far, far)
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

Every now and then I drown in thoughts of yesterday
And the fool's paradise that you blew away
I feel you beside me again and remember when
You came to my window on a dark and stormy day

Baby I need you now (I need you baby)
(Right now)
Tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

Long ago (long...)
You used to want me (you...)
Now it's all so far away (now it's all so far)
But you still haunt me
(You still haunt me, you still haunt me, yes you do baby)

Long ago (so long)
You used to want me (but you, you, you)
(You...)
Now it's all so far away (and now it's all so far)
(Far...)
But you still haunt me (haunt me, haunt me)
And take me back to yesterday

So long ago, so long ago
So long ago, so long ago
So long ago, so long ago
So long ago, so long ago
(And oh baby)

Baby I need you now (I need you now)
(I need you right now boy)
'Cause tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

Long ago (you... you used to)
You used to want me
(You really used to want me baby baby baby)
Now it's all so far away
(And now it's all so far)
But you still haunt me (haunt me, haunt me)
And take me back to yesterday

Long ago (so long...)
(So long ago, so long ago)
You used to want me (so long, so long)
(So long ago, so long ago)
Now it's all so far away (tonight I'm crumbling down)
(So long ago, so long ago)
But you still haunt me (you do you do you do you do)
(So long ago, so long ago)

(Once upon a time you came along)
Long ago
You used to want me
(And you whispered softly in my ear)
Now it's all so far away
(Loving words and all those fairytales)
But you still haunt me
(That I would long to hear)

[Song 149: Lullaby]
17 ContributorsLullaby Lyrics
Lullaby
(Lullaby, lullaby)
Lullaby
(Lullaby, lullaby)

I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

Hey boy, what's going on?
Thanks, I'm doing okay
Don't believe rumors- hey
How's your family?
Please say hello for me
Guess we've both grown up a bit
But I have to admit
It really still feels good
Here by your side
Sitting right next to you
Just like I used to do
You know we can't deny
No one else in our lives
Holds a candle to you and I

I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
Should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

So here we are again
All by ourselves
So familiar, you know
That it actually almost feels like deja vu
Of that night on the roof
We kissed under the sky amid the city lights
A sudden flashback to so long ago
In the dark, all alone
With our bodies this close
Guess some things never change
'Cause I still melt away
When you touch me
And say my name

I should just hug you goodbye
(Baby I)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(So)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(I'm gonna love you to sleep)
And we can revisit us one more time
(Paradise for a while by your side)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
(Lullaby)
I Should just hug you goodbye
(See I know I should)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(But boy, you just look so good)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

It still feels, feels good

(Lullaby)
I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(I can't walk away from paradise)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(So I'll take you home and sing it to you baby)
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
(Now I know that I should just)
I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(I can't, no)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
(Nobody else in our lives holds a candle to you and I)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
(shhh)
I should just hug you goodbye
(So hush pretty baby)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(It's just me and you)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(As we relive the splendor of you and I)
And we can revisit us one more time
(I'm gonna sing that sweet lullaby)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

[Song 150: Cruise Control]
17 ContributorsCruise Control Lyrics
2008, watch it, Yeah
Yo, Mariah Carey alongside Gong Marley
Huh, natty, check it, pepper
(Y'all know what this is)

Can't get him outta my mind
Can't explain it, but it's somethin 'bout him makin' me high
Like a motor revin' over and over, it don't stop
He cruised beside me, now I'm flyin', drivin'
Through yellow lights
I'm ignorin' every sign of caution that they provide
Driver's Education 101 slipped out of my mind
I need me a caddy with some cruise control
No, no, no

I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
But, oh-oh, I can't resist him
Just wanna kiss him
I need cruise control

Might needa go slow
I don't know why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah, I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night
He's cruisin' through my brain
Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, uh, he so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't wanna lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control

C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control

Can't nobody, can't nobody tell me nothin'
When he comes in to view
'Cause he's the flyest ting when he be cruisin' on me avenue
Then da door open, de gals 'pon de block
They be hopin, to rob the clock me say "No, man"
Step up, step up bottle broken
Think I'm jokin'

I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
But, oh-oh, I can't resist him
Just wanna kiss him
I need cruise control

Might needa go slow
I don't know why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah, I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night
He's cruisin' through my brain
Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, uh, he so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't wanna lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control

You put your hand in cruise control
And you deny me if you want
And you will starve yourself of love
If you don't speed and break the law
You can't get no speeding ticket
On the highway to my heart
And it might be a rocky road
And you can exit if you want (Why you always?)
Look at life just like a pessimist
You already like a wife up in my premises
And right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis
Just come again and stop and start just like a genesis

Might needa go slow
I don't know why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah, I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night
He's cruisin' through my brain
Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, uh, he so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't wanna lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control
