Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama

'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
And I've learned from the pain (Pain)

Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)

Still layin' in your bed, singin'

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on our hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime

So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby

There's nowhere we need to be, no, no, no
I'ma get to know you better
Kinda hope we're here forever
There's nobody on these streets
If you told me that the world's endin'
Ain't no other way that I can spend it

Oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh)
Got all this time in my hands
Might as well cancel our plans (Yeah, yeah)
I could stay here forever

So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me

So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't trade
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you

Woah

Go on, make me lose my mind
We got all that we need here tonight

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire

Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything

One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time

I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily

And healin' from somebody
Or somethin' we don't see just right

Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (No one can tell you nothin')
Come on and walk this way through the fire (Don't care what's on their mind)

Be your own fuckin' best friend

Keep moving like, "What's next?"

Underneath your own projections
Or change my most authentic life

And I might not be the one for you
But you ain't allowed to have no boo

'Cause I know we be so complicated
But we be so smitten, it's crazy
I can't have what I want, but neither can you

Passionate, but I don't give no fucks

Make everything taste like it is salt (Ayy, ooh, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Then you come through like the sweetener you are  (Ayy, sweetener, ayy, ayy, ayy)
To bring the bitter taste to a halt  (Ayy, sweetener, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

And then you get it, get it, get it, get it (Ayy)
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it (Ayy)
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say, "Oh," (Sheesh!) "Oh" (Sheesh!)
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it, and mix it, and mix it, and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say, "Oh," (Sheesh!) "Oh" (Sheesh!)

And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night
Things that we can light make me say, "Oh," (Sheesh!) "Oh" (Sheesh!)
Talking 'bout what you wanna do, whether it's wrong or right
I am followin’ you 'cause you make me say, "Oh," (Sheesh!) "Oh" (Sheesh!)
(Hey) Said I don't know what I'd do without you in my life (ayy), it'd be so sour (Sweetener, ayy)
I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours (Sweetener, sweetener, ayy, ayy, ayy, sweetener, ayy, ayy, ayy)

When life deals us cards (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Make everything taste like it is salt (Sheesh, sheesh!)
Then you come through like the sweetener you are (Ayy, sweetener, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
To bring the bitter taste to a halt (Sheesh, sheesh!)

And then you get it, get it, get it, get it (Ayy)
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it (Ayy)
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say, "Oh," (Sheesh!) "Oh" (Sheesh!, c'mon)
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it, and mix it, and mix it, and mix it (Yeah)
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it (Sweetener, sweetener, sweetener, sweet)

I didn't think you'd understand me
How could you ever even try?
I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die

Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love

Me and my truth, we sit in silence
Mm
Baby girl, it's just me and you
'Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna bite

Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment

Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing

Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

Mm-mm

Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep ('Sleep)
You're such a dream to me, mm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe (If you can believe)
Mm, you're such a dream to me

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up
Wake up (Oh), wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch 'em other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like, "I love you—," who starts a conversation like that? Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up
Wake up (Oh, no), wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mm, boy

I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, shh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it (Ooh, hey)

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
(No, I don't want, no)
'Cause you're such a dream (Does this end?)
If you can believe, you're such a dream to me

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under

After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears

Another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I’m sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I’m not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)
And I won't say I’m feeling fine
After what I been through, I can’t lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin’ on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it’s shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I been through, I can't lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh
If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh

I can't fake another smile (And I can't fake)
I can't fake like I'm alright (Another smile)
Woo, ah (Woo, ah) (Ooh)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine (I'm feeling fine)
After what I been through, I can't lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile

I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'

Ooh

Now, now she's in my bed, mm-mm, layin' on your chest
Now I'm in my head, wonderin' how it ends

Now you got me feelin' sorry
I showed you all my demons, all my lies
Yet you played me like Atari
Now it's like I'm lookin' in the mirror
Hope you feel alright when you're in her
I found a good boy and he's on my side
You're just my eternal sunshine, sunshine

So I try to wipe my mind
Just so I feel less insane
Rather feel painless
I'd rather forget than know, know for sure
What we could've fought through behind this door, mm

I left my heart at a pub in Hampstead
And I misplaced my mind in a good way
Threw away my reputation, but saved us more heartache
Yes, I know it seems fucked up and you're right
But quite frankly, you’re still wrong about everything
So far off, your seat's nowhere near the table
But I find something sweet in your peculiar behavior
'Cause I think to be so dumb must be nice
I do, I do, I do, I do
What makes you think you’re even invited?
The doors are closed with lights off inside and all the while
Therе's no one home, you're still outsidе
I wonder why

What's wrong with a little bit of poison? Tell me
I would rather feel everything than nothing every time
Ooh, fear me, stranger, a little bit of sugar, danger
I'd rather be seen and alive than dying by your point of view
I do, I do, I do, I do

I don't remember too much of the last year
But I knew who I was when I got here
'Cause I'm still the same but only entirely different
And my lover’s just some lines in some songs, mm

You think you’ve read the book I'm still writing
I can’t imagine wanting so badly to be right
Guess I'm forever on your mind
I wonder why

What's wrong with a little bit of poison? Tell me (Tell me)
I would rather feel everything than nothing every time (Every, every time)
Ooh, fear me, stranger (Stranger), a little bit of sugar (Sugar), danger (Danger)
I'd rather be seen and alive than dying by your point of view

Rather be swimming with you than drowning in a crowded room
I do, I do, I do, I do

Tell me somethin' I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain

And if in the moment, I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you'll know this is
Somethin' bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (Lo-love me harder)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder

I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain

And if in the moment, you bite your lip
When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time

'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (I'ma love you harder, hey!)
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

You got to try, try, try again, yeah (Woah, woah)
So what do I do if I can’t figure it out? (Figure it out)
I’m gonna leave, leave, leave again

'Cause if you want to keep me (Hey!)
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (I'ma love you, love you, love)

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby

If he will be, if he will be here

Oh, woah

I want you to keep speakin' my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night

Baby, pardon my French, but could you speak in tongues?
Never lost in translation 'cause you know what I want, boy
Treat it just like Givenchy (Givenchy), it's expensive to taste
Ain't no need to remind ya, it's AG in your face (Face)

If you're gon' keep speakin' my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feelin' anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you

I love the taste of you in the morning
Keep me warm and
Nothin' else, nothin' more important
Makes me wanna believe in love (Mmm)
I love the thought of us in the evening
Crave the feeling
The way you feel, somethin' 'bout it's healing
I'm praying we don't fuck this up (Ah-ah-ah, babe)

Others that I've had had to impress me before
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out

Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? (Ooh)
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious?

Maybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon
If you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon
Maybe you should pack a suitcase too (Too)
I love the thought of you never leavin' (No)
Days repeatin'
Gettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'
Never thought I'd believe in love again

Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

Break up, make up, total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind? (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on (Uh-uh), mm, hold on, ayy (Yeah)
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tockin', lip lockin'
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets (Swerve)
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up (Hold up), I know love can be a beach with no shore (Shore)
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four (Four)
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest (Oddest) couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just bein' honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

Break up, make up (Best, best, best mistake you ever had)
Total waste of time (Best, best, best mistake you ever had)
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we're blind? (Yeah)
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, mm, hold on, ayy

Big day in the morning

Won't abandon me again for you and I, I

Hope you won't, won't regret me
Hope you'll still think fondly of our little life

Woke up with a ghost by my side
Kissed by the passing of time, time
A moth to a flame, I didn't think, I just flew
I just didn't wanna change my mind, mind

Rhythms of the night consume my body
Just let the music confiscate my soul
You think I'm lost, but that's just how you found me
Well, maybe I'm the stranger after all

Always wondered what would happen if I let you lose me
Always wondered what would happen if I let myself need more
Might fuck around and elevate my expectations
Now I'm (I'm), fine (Fine), to leave you in a past life
Yeah, I'm (I'm), fine (Fine), to leave you in a past life

Phased me just like the moon
I used to think you were the medicine, but you were just code blue
And you're thinking it too and I already knew (Knew)
I just didn't wanna waste more time

Rhythms of the night consume my body
Just let the music confiscate my soul (Confiscate my soul)
You think I'm lost, but that's just how you found me
Well, maybe I'm the stranger after all

Always wondered what would happen if I let you lose me (Let you lose me)
Always wondered what would happen if I let myself need more
Might fuck around and elevate my expectations (Expectations)
Now I'm (I'm), fine (Fine), to leave you in a past life
Said, baby, I'm (I'm) fine (Fine) to leave you in a past life

Something just to save me, just to confiscate
My body, my soul (Confiscate my soul)
You think I'm lost but, that's just how you found me
Maybe, I am the stranger after all (I'm the stranger after all)

Always wondered what would happen if I let you lose me (Let you lose me)
Always wondered what would happen if I let myself need more
Might fuck around and elevate my expectations (Expectations)
Now I'm (I'm), fine (Fine), to leave you in a past life
Oh, baby, yeah, I'm (I'm), fine (I'm fine), to leave you in a past life

Something just to save me, something just to save me
Ah, ah
Something just to save me, something just to save me
Ah, ah

I looked in my rearview mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want

Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And, sometimes, I feel like we've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know, yeah
We can find our way home

Still so into us

A little too reckless

I don't even see it down the road

Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don’t make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can’t give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm tryin' to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blastin' out
But I won't get in the mood
I’m avoiding every mistletoe until I know it’s

True love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you’re really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can’t give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night ('Mas night)
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold (Yeah)
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

True love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna let him unwrap me, like, oh-ooh-oh (Ooh)
Get on top of him, by that fireplace, oh-ooh-oh (Ooh-oh)
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year, I've got to be smart
Oh, baby

(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he won't be, if he won't be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)

Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)

'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Tell me, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If you won't be, if you won't be here)

Hmm

We could go pop all the champagne in California
We could have omakase in Tokyo if you wanna
Hypothetically, we (We) could do (Do)
Anything that we like
We could hit up all the slopes in matching snowsuits
We could hang out at the Louvre all night if you want to
We could spend every dime
But I don't want (Want) anything ('Thing)
But more time

No matter what we do
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
No ordinary things with you
It's funny, but it's true
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
As long as I'm with you

You hit just like the first sip of wine after a long day
You hit like my biggеst fan when I hear what the critiquеs say
You hit just like a green light when I'm stuck runnin' real late
I don't need no diamonds, just your time

No matter what we do
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
No ordinary things with you
It's funny, but it's true
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
As long as I'm with you

Ordinary thing, ordinary things with you
Ordinary thing, as long as I'm with you

And when he'd come home, and I'd see him (Is it difficult?)
When he first gets off that train
It was like God Almighty arrived
It was like seein' daylight
I mean, I could've packed up and left a million times
You know? It's not that we never fought
You can overcome that
You know? It-it's very easy
And as I told her, never go to bed without kissin' goodnight
That's the worst thing to do, don't ever, ever do that
And if you can't, and if you don't feel comfortable doing it
You're in the wrong place, get out

Elphie's awkward, Glinda's cool
We were strangers, that's no lie
But now we're besties, ride or die

I study hard for every quiz
While Glinda chases boys with rizz
But, one day, we'll both meet the The Wiz

This song's good, kind of a bop

No better team in all of Oz

We'll tell the haters, "Say less"
Good one, thank you
That was great, not as great as my roommate

Wanna kick it? Let's go fly

Now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project

Oh, you really don't have to do that

I know!
That's what makes me so nice

Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I
And let's face it, right? Who isn't less fortunate than I?
My tender heart tends to start to bleed
And when someone needs a makeover, I simply have to take over
I know, I know exactly what they need
And even in your case
Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face
Don't worry, I'm determined to succeed
Follow my lead
And yes, indeed
You will be, ah
Popular
You're gonna be popular
I'll teach you the proper ploys when you talk to boys
Little ways to flirt and flounce, ooh!
I'll show you what shoes to wear, how to fix your hair
Everything that really counts to be popular
I'll help you be popular
You'll hang with the right cohorts, you'll be good at sports
Know the slang you've got to know
So let's start 'cause you've got an awfully long way to go

Don't be offended by my frank analysis
Think of it as personality dialysis
Now that I've chosen to become a pal
A sister and adviser, there's nobody wiser
Not when it comes to
Popular
I know about popular
And with an assist from me to be who you'll be
Instead of dreary who-you-were

Well, are!

There's nothing that can stop you from becoming populer… —lar!
La-la, la-la
We're gonna make you popular
When I see depressing creatures
With unprepossessing features
I remind them on their own behalf to think of
Celebrated heads of state
Or especially great communicators
Did they have brains or knowledge?
Don't make me laugh

They were

Popular

Right!

It's all about popular
It's not about aptitude, it's the way you're viewed
So it's very shrewd to be
Very, very popular like me, me
And though you protest
Your disinterest
I know clandestinely
You're gonna grin and bear it, your newfound popularity (Woo!)
La-la, la-la
La-la, la-la
La-la, ooh
You'll be popular
Just not quite as popular as me

Dearest, darlingest Momsie and Popsicle

My dear father

There's been some confusion over rooming here at Shiz

But of course, I'll care for Nessa

But of course, I'll rise above it

For I know that's how you'd want me to respond

Yes

There's been some confusion for, you see, my roommate is

Unusually and exceedingly peculiar
And altogether quite impossible to describe

Blonde
What is this feeling, so sudden and new?

I felt the moment I laid eyes on you

My pulsе is rushing

My head is reeling

Yeah, well, my facе is flushing

What is this feeling
Fervid as a flame?
Does it have a name?
Yes
Loathing
Unadulterated loathing

For your face

Your voice

Your clothing

Let's just say
I loathe it all
Every little trait, however small
Makes my very flesh begin to crawl
With simple, utter loathing
There's a strange exhilaration
In such total detestation
It's so pure, so strong
Though I do admit, it came on fast
Still, I do believe that it can last
And I will be loathing
Loathing you my whole life long

Dear Galinda, you are just too good
How do you stand it? I don't think I could
She's a terror, she's a tartar, we don't mean to show a bias
But, Galinda, you're a martyr
Well, these things are sent to try us

Poor Galinda, forced to reside
With someone so disgusticified
We just want to tell you, we're all on your side
We share your loathing

What is this feeling, so sudden and new?

Unadulterated loathing

I felt the moment I laid eyes on you

For her face, her voice, her clothing

My pulse is rushing, my head is reeling (Let's just say)

We loathe it all

Oh, what is this feeling?

Every little trait, however small

Does it have a name?

Makes our very flesh begin to crawl

Yes

Ah

In such total detestation

Still, I do believe that it can last

And I will be loathing for forever
Loathing truly deeply
Loathing you (Loathing you)

My whole life long

Loathing
Unadulterated loathing

(This year, to save me from tears) You blew it
(I'll give it to someone special) You do it, do it
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December
You left my heart a mess
This year, to save me from tears (Boy, you blew it)
I'll give it to someone special (How could you do it, do it?)

[Song 112: True Love]
34 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsTrue Love LyricsOn “True Love,” Ariana Grande and Tommy Brown give a classic Christmas Carol a catchy R&B twist.
On that first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
Boy, you showed me things
Come hold me, please, and never let me go
On that second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me that promise ring
To keep 'til we get old, boy

On that third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
Said I love you and meant it, oh
On the fourth, we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh-oh, ah-ah, ah-ah)
You are my true love

On the fifth day of Christmas
You asked me what's on my wishlist
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo
After six days in your arms
I got that tattoo on my heart
'Cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star
Ain't nothin' shinin' more than you, boy

You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
You're so one in a million, oh
I'm so glad we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, you are my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me (You are my true love)
My true love, my true love (Oh)
You are my true love
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh-oh, ah-ah, ah-ah)
You are my true love

Needed to catch myself, like what the hell?

Push you 'til you break

Stopped thinkin' like a victim
This time, I'll throw it back
Boy, can you handle that?
Got you trippin', gave you no attention

Get back on your job like you employed, boy, psha

Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's more around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinking, "Is this too good to be true?"

That we're living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better

As I'm layin' down with you every night
It still gets to me, that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew

I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better

Just look up
There is no place to hide
True love doesn't die
It holds on tight and never lets you go
Just look up
You cannot deny the signs

Don't wait no more

And you can act like everything is alright
But this is probably happening in real time
Celebrate or cry or pray, whatever it takes
To get you through the mess that we made
'Cause tomorrow may never come

Just look up
Turn off that shit Box News
'Cause you're about to die soon everybody
Ooh, I, I, oh, I

Come and trim my Christmas tree

Dear Santa, it's me, Ariana
I know it's been a while but I really need your help this year
Let me make this clear
See, I, I really love him and it's been kinda tough
'Cause he's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flyin' away, away from me

I don't need another gift, I just have one wish
This year, can you

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow mornin'
Give me somethin' to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow in California

Dear Santa, what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day
Make it go away, mm-mm
See, I, I really need him to stay for a couple more days
Can't you make his five o'clock flight delay?
Won't you find a way?

I don't need another gift, I just have one wish, oh, yeah
This year, can you

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow mornin'
Give me somethin' to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow in California

I know I'm askin' for the impossible, but I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me, so please, please

Just make it snow in California, I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow mornin' (Ooh)
Give me somethin' to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow (Let it snow)
Let it snow (Let it snow) in California

You don't have to have much to show how much you care, like
Give a wink, give a kiss, like
Give a little happiness, like-like-like
