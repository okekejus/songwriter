It's a little bit funny
This feelin' inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, heh
But then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travellin' show, oh
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world

I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgettin'
But these things I do
You see, I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody
This is the song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world

You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well, look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin', you just fade away

Don't you know, I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

You know, I'm still standin' better than I ever did
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid

Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hittin' somethin' that's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out

Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know, I read it in a magazine, oh-oh

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me (Don't let the sun)
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life (Don't let the sun) to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

Don't let the sun go down on me (Don't let the sun)
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life (Don't let the sun) to wander free

In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if ya did

When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singin' the blues

Ah, ah-ah ah ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm goin' back to my plough
Back to the howlin' old owl in the woods
Huntin' the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Ah, ah-ah ah ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffin' for tidbits like you on the ground

Ah, ah-ah ah ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm goin' back to my plough

There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)

I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues


Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
Some say, "Eat or be eaten"
Some say, "Live and let live"
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give

In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life

Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rollin' high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding, yeah

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Your candle burned out long before

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch, we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed yourself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills

I may sink a little drink and shout out, "She's with me"
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh


Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
'Cause Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in

Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Song 17: Sacrifice]
42 ContributorsSacrifice Lyrics
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all

Holy Moses, I have been removed
I have seen the spectre, he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses, I have been removed

Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction, and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses, I have been deceived

I'm going back to the border where my affairs
My affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes, oh
Holy Moses, I have been deceived

Holy Moses, let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there, what's his color? I don't care
He's my brother, let us live in peace, oh
He's my brother, let us live in peace, oh
He's my brother, let us, let us live in peace

32 ContributorsSorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word Lyrics
What have I gotta do to make you love me?
What have I gotta do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there?

What do I do to make you want me?
What have I gotta do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad (So sad), so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's gettin' more and more absurd
It's sad (So sad), so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word


It's sad (So sad), so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's gettin' more and more absurd
It's sad (So sad), so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

What do I do to make you love me?
Oh, what have I gotta do to be heard?

The roses in the window box have tilted to one side
Everything about this house was born to grow and die
Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said, "I'm sorry, honey, if I don't change the pace
I can't face another day"

And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the burnin' hoops of fire that you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change comes down your way, girl
You'll make it back somehow

And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands


And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

Oh!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love lies bleedin' in my hands
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!

Levon bears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot, they say
Spends his days countin'
In a garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said "God is dead
And the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing, watchin' them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailin'
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said "God is dead
And the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo! And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo! And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer, and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor (Ooh)

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)


I never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
(Oh!)

Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)


And I would've walked head-on into the deep end of the river
Clingin' to your stocks and bonds
Payin' your H.P. demands forever
They're comin' in the mornin' with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength, and run the field you play alone

Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye

Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight

And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City

Until you've seen this trash can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you

While Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

This Broadway's got
It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes, I might join in
I'd go my way alone
I'd grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City

Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found

While Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say

But now I know that rose trees never grow

Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found

May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

I'm getting bored
Being part of mankind
There's not a lot to do no more
This race is a waste of time
People rushing everywhere
Swarming around like flies
Think I'll buy a .44
Give 'em all a surprise

I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues

A rift in my family
I can't use the car
I gotta be in by ten o'clock
Who do they think they are?
I'd make an exception
If you wanna save my life
Brigitte Bardot gotta come
And see me every night

I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues

Kill myself

Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact

Sell my soul by dropping names

When I look back, boy, I must have been green
Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind

They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

Well, I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the fools back home, well, said I was a fool
They said, oh, "Believe in the Lord" is the golden rule

They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, change is gonna do me good
(Ooh, baby)
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, oh, change is gonna do me good

They said, stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
Living in the city, boy, is, is gonna break your heart
But how can you stay when your heart says no
Ha, how can you stop when your feet say go

You better get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, the change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I

And ironin' out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (Ah)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh-oh-oh, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (Gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (Ooh)
Sad songs say so much

If someone else is sufferin' enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

So turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs

The words I have to say
May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do

Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

You say it's very hard
To leave behind the life we knew
But there's no other way
And now it's really up to you

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen?

Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean?

Hey Nikita, is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow

Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

Do you ever dream of me?
And do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita, do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Never know anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

(Nikita) Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita) Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita) Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row

[Song 34: Skyline Pigeon]
12 ContributorsSkyline Pigeon Lyrics
Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinking of the way that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey

For just a skyline pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
Fly away again

Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind

Just let me wake up in the morning
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all, please free me from this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

For just a skyline pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again

Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very, so very far behind

Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of "Mummy doesn't love me" blues

Reality it seems was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen?
And hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey), you know what I mean
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away

Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday, oh, they found you in the subway dead

And who could you call your friends down in SoHo?
One or two middle-aged dykes in a go-go
But what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo?
And hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey), oh, don’t you know?

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they'd say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away

There was a time
I was everythin' and nothin' all in one
When you found me
I was feelin' like a cloud across the sun

I need to tell ya
How you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay

And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

With a smile
You pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty
I'm speechless, and I don't know where to start

And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
(Oh) Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Oh, takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
(The way you look) Way you look tonight
The way you look tonight

I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know

Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today?
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You better get your coat, dear, it looks like rain

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The in-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the madman across the water?

Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know

The ground's a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black or are the windows painted?
Will they come again next week, can my mind really take it?

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The in-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the madman across the water?

If you feel that it's real, I'm on trial
And I'm here, yeah, in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason

Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

[Song 40: Pinball Wizard]
20 ContributorsPinball Wizard Lyrics
Ever since I was a young boy I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton I must've played them all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

(How do you think he does it?) I don't know
(What makes him so good?)

Well, he ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see lights a-flashin', he plays by sense of smell
Always has a replay, never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He can't beat me now, I've always been the champ
I know every trick, no freak's gonna beat my hand

(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)

Even on my usual table he can beat the best
His disciples lead him in and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, I've never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist
He's a pinball wizard, he scores a trillion more
A pinball wizard, the world's new pinball lord
He's scoring more, he's scoring more


I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
To him, to him

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep, blue sea
On a blue, blue day
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the mornin' comes
I'll be far away
And I say

Blue eyes, holdin' back the tears
Holdin' back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear, blue sky
Watchin' over me
Blue eyes
Ooh, I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see

Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home, and I am home again
Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home again

35 ContributorsAlways Love You Lyrics
I will always love you
Even when I say I don't
I will always see you
Even when my eyes are closed
Uncertain of a lot of things
But with you, I've always known
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
Even if you let me go

Cryin' about somebody, tell her
Somebody come pass an umbrella
Fucked this bitch inside the 'tella
I had to take the call, past the tele'
I bought you Gucci, baby, Mais' Margiela
You can get a new one, but he won't be better
Straight to the top and don't need no propeller
Oh, I've been all outside with the fellas
Take me back, I can put you in control if you take me back
Goodfella, roll in a new Maybach
She been fuckin' me good and I'm hooked like crack
Make sure you ballin', don't worry 'bout nothin'
You keep on goin' forward and never look back
You bring me luck just like 7-Eleven
And just for that, I'ma give you some racks, let you splurge
Mama, what's the word?
All I do is flirt, just do it like a verb
Takin' off your skirt, this the night I make you squirt
Pull up to the tele', watch me murk you with no dirt
Bet you never leave

I will always love you
Even when I say I don't (Even when I say I don't)
I will always see you
Even when my eyes are closed
Uncertain of a lot of things
But with you, I've always known (I've always known)
I will always love you (Always)
I will always love you (Love you)
I will always love you (Love you)
Even if you let me go
(Even if you let me go, ooh)

I never thought you would end up as the enemy
I always thought you'd be right here, still defending me
I feel so bad for you, lost your identity
Made your decision, there's a penalty
It's so hard for me to understand
(It's so hard for me to understand)
I guess the universe had different plans
(I guess the universe had different plans)
I put my love, I put my love in your hands
In your hands
But that was so you
You had to leave, I had to go too
I could always tell that you had no clue
You never understood what I had to go through
But then, I guess somewhere deep inside, we both knew
So the memories is what I'll toast to
'Cause in the past life when everything felt right
You used to know me (And I got to know you)
Once upon a time when we rolled out
But now, baby, oh, no, you sold out

I will always love you
Even when I say I don't (Even when I say I don't)
I will always see you
Even when my eyes are closed
Uncertain of a lot of things
But with you, I've always known (I've always known)
I will always love you (Always)
I will always love you (Love you)
I will always love you (Love you)
I will always love you (Love you)
I will always love you (Love you)
I will always love you (Love you)
Even if you let me go

I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

And I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man, I've seen so much traffic

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

Oh, the joke was never hard to tell
Threw my spare change in the wishing well
The dream alone is always in your hands
If that don't fill the boy and build the man
A heart has many secrets, so I'm told
Through the years, a theory can grow cold
I'm up to be the king, it's gotten clear
The voice inside my head is the one I hear

Singing, I'm gonna love me again
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know?
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, and don't you know?
And oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again

Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

The golden age was somehow bittersweet
But now the past lies sleepin' in the deep
The peaceful days that followed hollow nights
A kiss or touch could feel like Kryptonite
Praise the Saints that hung up on my wall
For trust is left in lovers after all
A whispered word emergin' from a tale
My wake-up call to claim the cursed spell

Well, I'm gonna love me again (Love me again)
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know?
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, and don't you know?
And oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again


Sing, I'm gonna love me again
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know?
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, don't you know?
And oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again

I'm gonna love me again
I'm gonna love me again

You don't need to laugh so hard
You don't have to wear a tie
Sometimes honest is bein' caught inside a lie
And I have been there
I have been there

If I'd lived an easy life
Would I still choose you? Would I fall on the same knife?
A rodeo queen breathing fire into the night
I have been there
Man, I've been there

What do you say we set the pleasantries aside?
Even the diamonds look like rocks to the untrainеd eye
What does it cost to buy your soul back whеn you die?
What are the angels gonna do with you and I?

I
What do the angels do with you and I?
Blame the end of days
Mercury in retrograde
Who believes in angels anyway?

The color of the lie is white
I would die on that hill in a one-handed fight
If you're not swingin' first you were never in the right
I have been there
Man, I've been there

What do you say we set the pleasantries aside?
Even the diamonds look like rocks to the untrained eye
What does it cost to buy your soul back when you die?
What are the angels gonna do with you and I?

I
What do the angels do with you and I?
Blame the end of days
Mercury in retrograde
Who believes in angels anyway? (Oh, no)
Blame the end of days
Mercury in retrograde
Who believes in angels anyway?

There's no need to curse the stars
Or bite before you bark
But when you need someone to walk with in the dark
I have been there
I have been there

I have been there
I have been there
Man, I've been there
Woah, yeah, been there
I've been there
Man, I've been there
I’ve been there

With the smell of woodsmoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging
Upon a painted tepee
Oh, I went to see my chieftain
With my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon
Would very soon be leaving
This I can't believe I said
I can't believe our Warlord's dead
Oh, he would not leave the chosen ones
To the buzzards and the soldiers' guns
Oh, great father of the Iroquois
Ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke
And breast-fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk
And ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux
To make a chieftain's daughter mine
And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed?
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog, whom white man fears?

I take only what is mine, Lord
My pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die
Along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon
And the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold
And the healing waters run
Trampling down the prairie rose
Leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me
I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades
Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons
When they filled him full of lead
Now there seems no reason why
I should carry on
In this land that once was my land
I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet
And the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow
And ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon
Along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields
Without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Comes with a bullet hole

Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
"Two teas both with sugar please", in the back of an alley
While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and "Hey mom
Do the papers say anything good?
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys?
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods?"

Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback, the honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the '68 summer festival wallflowers are thinning

For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Hmm, couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb

For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down

I lie awake and realize
That you're better than my dreams
Thought I found love so many times
'Til you showed me what it means

Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh, no, baby
They were just doin' it wrong
I gave up on love until you made me believe in it after all
After all, mmm

If you never fell out of the sky
I don't know what I would do
I wouldn't trade one thousand lives
For the one I have with you

Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh, no, baby
They were just doin' it wrong
I gave up on love until you madе me believе in it after all
After all, oh, ah

Baby, after all, oh-oh-woah
It's not the same, not the same, not the same, oh

[Song 50: My Strongest Suit]
8 ContributorsMy Strongest Suit Lyrics
In life, one has to face a huge assortment
Of nauseating fads and good advice
There's health, and fitness, diet, and deportment
And other pointless forms of sacrifice
Conversation? Wit? I am a doubter
Manners? Charm? They're no way to impress
So forget the inner me, observe the outer
I am what I wear and how I dress
Oh, now I believe in lookin'
Like my time on earth is cookin'
Whether polka dotted, striped or even checked
With some glamour guaranteeing
Every fiber on of my being
Is displayed to quite remarkable effect
From your cradle via trousseau
To your deathbed you're on view, so
Never compromise, accept no substitute
I would rather wear a barrel
Than conservative apparel
For my dress has always been...my strongest suit
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)

Staying in or hitting town-wards
From the top and working downwards
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time (Is stitched in time)
Whether wig or hat or turban
Whether clad boudoir or urban
Not to strut your stuff outrageously is a crime (It's such a crime)
And the few who are invited (Overwear)
To my wardrobe are delighted (Underwear)
As they wander through my things (Anytime)
To find en route (We're wandering through your things)
That in negligee or formal (Negligee)
I am anything but normal (Anything but normal)
And dress has always been my strongest suit
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
I am what I wear
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
I said anytime...
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
Anywhere
So bring me all my finest (Finest)
Most audacious, my divinest (Divinest)
Most revealing, most expensive and to boot (Most revealing, most expensive)
(Most arresting) Most arresting
(Most heartstopping) Most heartstopping
Most free-flowing (Overwear)
Most eye-popping (Underwear)
Most arresting (Anytime)
Most heartstopping, yeah (Anywhere)
Dress has always been my strongest suit!

(I am what I wear)
My strongest suit
(I am what I wear)
You know that I am what I wear
(I am what I wear)
Dress has always been my strongest suit!
So bring me all my finest (My finest)
Most audacious, my divinest (Divinest)
Most revealing, most expensive and to boot (Most revealing, most expensive)
Most arresting, most heartstopping
Most free-flowing, most eye-popping
Dress has always been my strongest suit!
(I am what I wear)
My strongest suit
(I am what I wear)
You know that I am what I wear
Dress has always been my strongest
My strongest, my strongest
My strongest, my strongest
My strongest suit!

Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes
And give it to the likes of me
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
So I see you when I can
You make me all a man can be

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh, Jeannie, you were always someone's fool

Little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years
You still retain the fears of youth
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
But you're burnin' it up so fast
Searchin' for some lasting truth

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
But oh, Jeannie, I will always be your fool


And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others, and I've known quite a few
But oh, Jeannie, I'm still in love with you

You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love, I'm so in love
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love, I'm so in love

[Song 52: When This Old World Is Done With Me]
6 ContributorsWhen This Old World Is Done With Me Lyrics
I won't want for nothing
I've been alright, I've been okay, I've been fine
I've had clouds of silver linings, complicated mornings
Love that left me wanting and hearts that change my mind
I can feel the cold front
I've been chilly, I've been frozen, I've been warm
I've felt sympathy and silence, helping hands and guidance
Happiness and anger since the day that I was born

When this old world is done with me
Just know I came this far
To be broken up in pieces
Scatter me among the stars
When this old world is done with me
When I close my eyes
Release me like an ocean wave
Return me to the tide

None of this came easy
The shadows, the curtain, or the light
The pain inside the leaving, the taming of the demons
No longer any reason left for me to fight

And when this old world is done with me
Just know I came this far
To be broken up in pieces
Scatter me among the stars
When this old world is done with me
When I close my eyes
Release me like an ocean wave
Return me to the tide
Release me like an ocean wave
Return me to the tide

Hey you, you're a child in my head
You haven't walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear you'll be blessed

I know you're still just a dream
Your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway you'll be blessed

And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed

I need you before I'm too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that you're blessed

And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that
You, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed

You, oh, you
Are still a beauty to behold
You been my muse
Every story that I've told
Oh, take me back some years
To when we were young without a fear

All along, you have been the song that I wanna hear

I been down the darkest alleys
Been to the bottom where the angels cry
Thought it had all been all for nothin'
Until I saw you at the finish line

Forgive me for the ways I've let ya down
Won't you give me another chance to make you proud?
Oh, flash forward twenty years
Forever keep me young and my conscience clear

All along, you have been the song that I wanna hear, ooh yeah, ah

I've been down the darkest alleys
Been to the bottom where the angels cry (Where the angels cry)
Thought it had all been all for nothin'
Until I saw you at the finish line


Yeah, yeah
Yes, I been down the darkest alleys
Been to the bottom where the angels cry (Angels cry)
Thought it had all been all for nothin'
Until I saw you at the finish line (At the finish line)
Oh, I been down the darkest alleys
Been to the bottom watching life go by (Watching life go by)
Thought it had all been all for nothin'
Until I saw you at the finish line (At the finish line, yeah, oh, woah)

I've been down the darkest alleys (Down to the bottom)
Been to the bottom where the angels cry
Thought it had all been all for nothin'
Until I saw you (Saw you) at the finish line

Lately, I've been thinking
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield
Brightening the daybreak

Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh
Like a puppy, child

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

I can see you sitting, eating
Apples in the evening
The fruit juice, flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body

Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh
Like a puppy, child

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other

Oh, if only I could nestle
In the cradle of your cabin
My arm's around your shoulder, whoa
The window's wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore, whoa
Are playing in the valley
Oh, I miss you, Amoreena
Like the king bee misses honey

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other
And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other, oh

Lately, I've been thinking, oh
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield
Oh, brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, whoa

She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
B-B-B-Bennie, B-B-B-Bennie

Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots (Electric boots)
A mohair suit (A mohair suit)

Yeah
Let me get it now, momma, I made it
True story, I have upgraded
Everbody back then used to hate it
Now they all appreciate it
I might sound out of my mind
Matter of fact, out of line
But I been runnin' and gunnin'
Been fightin' for something in due time
I'm finna take it to the line
I'm in the beginning of the prime
Tony Montana–the world's mine
Yeah, it's finally 'bout time
Went from Section 8 to better times
Serving food to writin' rhymes
For Elton John, the greatest of all time!

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots (Electric boots)

[Song 57: Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)]
20 ContributorsEmpty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny) LyricsThis song was dedicated to John Lennon, a dear friend of Elton John’s. He talks about how he wishes they could still be able to play music together.
What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden
Among the flagstones there
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect
Can damage so much grain

And what's it for?
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk
Nothin' grows no more
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed
We're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one
No one can replace

And I've been knockin'
But no one answers
And I've been knockin'
Most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin'
"Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger
If only he could hear
Who lived there?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain
And with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

And I've been knockin'
But no one answers
And I've been knockin'
Most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin'
"Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"

And I've been knockin'
But no one answers
And I've been knockin'
Most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin'
"Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out?
Can you come out to play?"

Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?

[Song 58: I Just Can’t Wait to Be King]
10 ContributorsI Just Can’t Wait to Be King Lyrics
Way behind the water hole, a little down the line
The jungle and the plains and peaks are scheduled to be mine
I'm gonna be the ruler of most everythin' around
From the grandest top of the mountains to the humble common ground
My reign will be a super awesome thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

I'm gonna be a noble king, unscrupulously fair
I only need a little time, perhaps a little hair
I'm gonna be the main event like no king was before
I'm brushin' up on lookin' down, I'm workin' on my roar
The fauna and the flora gonna swing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

No one sayin', "Do this"
No one sayin', "Be there"
No one sayin', "Stop that"
No one sayin', "See here"
Free to run around all day
I'll be free to do it my way
Hey


No one sayin', "Do this"
No one sayin', "Be there"
No one sayin', "Stop that"
No one sayin', "See here"
Free to run around all day
Free to do it my way

"The time has come," as someone said, "to talk of many things"
That may be true, but I would rather stick to talkin' kings
It's easy to be royal if you're already leonine
It isn't just my right, even my left will be divine
The monarchy is waitin' to go zing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Oh, oh
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Song 59: Grey Seal]
17 ContributorsGrey Seal Lyrics

Why's it never light on my lawn?
Why does it rain and never say, "Good day" to the newborn?
On the big screen, they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry, then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the phoenix bird can fly, then so can I

And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise?
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal

[Song 60: Written in the Stars]
6 ContributorsWritten in the Stars Lyrics
I am here to tell you we can never meet again
Simple, really, isn't it? A word or two, and then
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell
The someone you once loved so long ago so well

Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by
You don't have to ask me, and I need not reply
Every moment of my life from now until I die
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand

Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day

Nothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned
What it is to be in love and have that love returned

Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God's experiment
Oh, in which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day

Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say (In which we have no say)
In which we're given paradise (Given paradise)
But only for a day

Wise men say
"It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us it's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes"

The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Somethin' happened
It's so strange this feelin'
Naïve notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we?
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Strugglin' through the day
When even your best friend says
"Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?"


And only passin' time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Runnin' with the losers for a while
But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

Wise men say
"It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes"

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
We all fall in love sometimes

Yesterday you came to lift me up
As light as straw and brittle as a bird
Today I weigh less than a shadow on the wall
Just one more whisper of a voice unheard
Tomorrow leave the windows open
As fear grows please hold me in your arms
Won't you help me if you can to shake this anger
I need your gentle hands to keep me calm

Because I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his son

Things we never said come together
The hidden truth no longer haunting me
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken
That kind of understanding sets me free

Because I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his son

16 ContributorsSweet Painted Lady Lyrics
I'm back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in a drain
We're all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned

If the boys all behave themselves here
Well, there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear
You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight
Oh, the prices I charge here will see you alright

So she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game, oh

Forget us, we'll have gone very soon
Just forget we ever slept in your rooms
And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds
Where love's just a job and nothing is said

So as she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game, oh

Tune me in to the wild side of life
I'm an innocent young child, sharp as a knife
Take me to the garretts where the artists have died
Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied
Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine
Light colored candles in dark dreary mines
Look in the mirror and stare at myself
And wonder if that's really me on the shelf

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune

Take me down alleys where the murders are done
In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun
Want to read books in the studies of men
Born on the breeze and die on the wind
If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
I'd study my subject and silently cry
Cry for the darkness to come down on me
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune

13 ContributorsBelieve Lyrics
I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father, and that means somethin' to me

Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later

But love
I believe in love

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease

Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone

Without love
I believe in love


Without love, I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love, I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here

Without love, I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you and I wouldn't believe in me

Without love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love

For friends are found on every road
Can you ever think of any better way
For the lost and weary travellers to go
Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all right
It seems to me a crime that we should age
These fragile times should never slip us by
A time you never can or shall erase
As friends together watch their childhood fly
Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all right
Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all right

Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me
Or are you still the same spoiled child?
Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you thought to go
Am I the only man you ever had
Or am I just the last surviving friend
That you know?

Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I wanna love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony

Hello, baby, hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
In any case I set my own pace by stealing the show
Say hello, hello
Ah!

Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I want to love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony

Never leaving harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Ah-ah!

12 ContributorsJamaica Jerk-Off Lyrics
When she gets up in the morning
It's enough to wake the dead
Oh she turning on the radio
And dancing on my head
It's no good living in the sun
Playing guitar all day
Boogalooing with my friends
In that erotic way

Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way

Let the ladies and the gentlemen
Be as rude as they like
On the beaches, oh in the jungle
Where the people feel alright
So do it in Jamaica, yeah
Got plenty for you and me
Honky tonking with my baby
In that deep blue sea

Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way


Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day

[Song 69: Dirty Little Girl]
8 ContributorsDirty Little Girl Lyrics
I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck
I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck
That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard
But I'm gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard
When I watch the police come by and move you on
Well, I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become
Well, you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear
But all you got was a mop-up job washing other people's stairs

I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
Oh! (oh!)

I'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, I bet she
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped

I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
I should tell (I should tell)
Oh! (oh!)

I'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, oh, I bet she, let me tell you now
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

Oh ho
Ah ho!
'Cause I bet she, oh, I bet she
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year

Dirty little girl (girl)
Oh ho (oh ho)
Dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Girl, girl, girl, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Oh, oh, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)
Girl, girl, girl, dirty, dirty little girl

[Song 70: The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-1934)]
14 ContributorsThe Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-1934) Lyrics
Some punk with a shotgun killed young Danny Bailey
In cold blood, in the lobby of a downtown motel
Killed him in anger, a force he couldn't handle
Helped pull the trigger that cut short his life
And there's not many knew him the way that we did
Sure enough he was a wild one, but then aren't most hungry kids?

Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead, oh
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in

We're running short of heroes back up here in the hills
Without Danny Bailey, we're gonna have to break up our stills
So mark his grave well 'cause Kentucky loved him
Born and raised a proper, I guess life just bugged him
And he found faith in danger, a lifestyle he lived by
A running gun youngster in a sad restless age

Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in

Ooh, I got a busted wing and a hornet sting
Like an out-of-tune guitar
Ooh, she got a Hercules on her side
And Diana in her eyes

Some men kneel and pray
Ooh, well, I like women and I like wine
And I've always liked it that way
Always liked it that way

That old tough-man routine up her sleeves
Livin' and a-lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Livin' and a-lovin' with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules

Oh, and it hurts like hell to see my girl messin' with a muscle boy
No Superman gonna ruin my plans
Playin' with my toys
Rich man sweatin' in a sauna bath
Poor boy scrubbin' in a tub
Me, I stay gritty up to my ears
Washin' in a bucket of mud
Washin' in a bucket of mud

16 ContributorsI’ve Seen That Movie Too Lyrics
I can see by your eyes you must be lying
When you think I don't have a clue
Baby, you're crazy
If you think that you can fool me
Because I've seen that movie too

The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles
With the knives in their eyes
Well, their actions become so absurd

So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too

It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around
Stop twinkling your star like you do
I'm not the blueprint
For all of your B-films
Because I've seen that movie too

The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles
Oh, with the knives in their eyes
Oh, their actions become so absurd

So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too


So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting

So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting

Qinisa
Qinisa mfana nge gazi lemvana
Sonke sithande ngo
Qinisa, qinisa
Qinisa nge gazilemvana

It's never too late to turn things around
Recover, unravel the past to confound
The doubters and losers, that line of despair
Will tell you it's over, you're going nowhere
It's never too late, I hope
It's never too late

It's never too late to get back on track
To get at least some, if not all of it back
I thought I was happy, and sometimes I was
But sadness is just as important because
Got to carry the weight and hope
It's never too late

Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to cheat the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time has often moved too fast, but time is now, my friend
I'm a long way from the start but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late

Konke, konke
Zok' nqoba mfana

It's never too late to get up off the ground
Don't have to be noticed, don't have to crowned
I get what I done and I don't try to hide
I lost many things, but never my pride
It's never too late, I know
It's never too late

Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to cheat the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time has often moved too fast, but time is now, my friend
I'm a long way from the start but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late

I used to say I don't have time, I'm sleepin' tonight
A day doin' nothin' is doin' it right
No hurry, no Harry, takes as long as it takes
You might as well sleep for all the difference it makes
I didn't find love or the peace or the breaks
These aren't excuses but a string of mistakes
I won't go back there, not goin' back there

Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to cheat the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Never too late to fight the fight, babe
Never too late to cheat the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time has often moved too fast, but time is now, my friend
I'm a long way from the start but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late

It's never too late (Sonke s'hambe ngoxolo)

7 ContributorsCurtains Lyrics“Curtains” is the second part of “We All Fall In Love Sometimes.” It was played as a single track and then cut in two for the album, and it is usually played together live.
I used to know this old scarecrow
He was my song
My joy and sorrow
Cast alone between the furrows
Of a field no longer sown by anyone
I held a dandelion
That said the time had come
To leave upon the wind
Not to return
When summer burned the earth again
Oh...
Oh...

Cultivate the freshest flower
This garden ever grew
Beneath these branches
I once wrote such childish words for you
But that's okay
There's treasure children always seek to find
And just like us
You must have had
A once upon a time

Sometimes you dream, sometimes it seems
There's nothing there at all
You just seem older than yesterday
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
You draw to the curtains and one thing's for certain
You're cozy in your little room
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight

Nine o'clock mornings, five o'clock evenings
I'd liven the pace if I could
Oh, I'd rather have a ham in my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do any good
Lay back in my armchair, close eyes and think clear
I can hear hoofbeats ahead
Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
While the wife and the kids are in bed

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight

12 ContributorsThis Train Don’t Stop There Anymore Lyrics
You may not believe it
But I don't believe in miracles anymore
And when I think about it
I don't believe I ever did for sure
All the things I've said in songs
All the purple prose you bought from me
Reality's just black and white
The sentimental things I'd write
Never meant that much to me

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

You don't need to hear it
But I'm dried up and sick to death of love
And if you need to know it
I never really understood that stuff
All the stars and bleeding hearts
All the tears that welled up in my eyes
Never meant a thing to me
Read 'em, as they say, and weep
I never felt enough to cry

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

When I say that I don't care
It really means my engine's breakin' down
The chisel chips my heart again
The granite cracks beneath my skin
I crumble into pieces on the ground

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore
Oh yeah

[Song 79: Easy As Life]
7 ContributorsEasy As Life Lyrics
This is the moment when
The gods expect me to beg for help
But I won't even try
I want nothing in the world
But myself to protect me
And I won't lie down, roll over, and die
All I have to do is forget how much I love him
All I have to do is put my longing to one side
Tell myself that love's an ever-changing situation
Passion would have cooled and all the magic
Would have died
It's easy, it's easy
All I have to do is to pretend I never knew him
On those very rare occasions when he steals into my heart
Better to have lost him when the ties were barely binding
Better the contempt of the familiar cannot start
It's easy, it's easy
Until I think about him as he was when I last touched him
And how he would have been, were I to be with him today
Those very rare occasions don't let up, they keep on coming
All I've ever wanted and I'm throwing it away
It's easy, it's easy as life

But then I see the faces of a worn, defeated people
A father and a nation who won't let a coward run
Is this how the gods reward the faithful through the ages?
Forcing us to move and they're the hardest things we've done
They're easy, so easy
And though I'll think about him
'Til the earth draws in around me
And though I choose to leave him for another kind of love
This is no denial, no betrayal, but redemption
Redeemed in my own eyes and in the pantheon above
It's easy, it's easy as life
It's easy as life
It's easy as life!

Singing loud sweet Georgia, ooh, my soul
Black mascara thicker than molasses
Sex and sinners take a toll
Freedom feathers falling from old Jim Crow
Got the Mississippi Blues on the radio
Big Easy baking in the red-hot sun
Rock and roll to number one

Little Richard woke up wanting (Wanting)
To cast off sex and idols
God whispered in his ear, "Come on over here
Son, get yourself a Bible"
Pompadour piled high to the sky
Christ is coming by and by
Long Tall Sally, my, oh my
He's got the good book by his side

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh)

With Richard and the Devil divided
The Holy Word from Heaven's hands
The sound of sweet salvation
Ringing in the ears of every man
Made up, looking pretty
Vanity won't prevail
It's hot down south, but shut your mouth
Grab that old boy by the tail

Little Richard woke up wanting (Wanting)
To cast off sex and idols

Always half a step behind
Always half a step behind

Anywhere but where we are

There's a fly in the window, a dog in the yard
And a year since I saw you
There's a trunk in the corner I keep all my letters
My bills and demands I keep too

Well, I can't help thinking about the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me, cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine

Drunk all the time, feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days, we'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together without a wife in line?
To pick the crop and get me hot on elderberry wine

Round a tree in the summer, a fire in the fall
Flat out when they couldn't stand
The bottle went round like a woman down south
Passed on from hand to hand

Well, I can't help thinking about the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me, cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine

Drunk all the time, feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days, we'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together without a wife in line?
To pick the crop and get me hot on elderberry wine
Drunk all the time, feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days, we'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together without a wife in line?
To pick the crop and get me hot on elderberry wine

Ooh, elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine

[Song 84: Every Story Is A Love Story]
6 ContributorsEvery Story Is A Love Story Lyrics
Every story, tale or memoir
Every saga or romance
Whether true or fabricated
Whether planned or happenstance
Whether sweeping through the ages
Casting centuries aside
Or a hurried brief recital
Just a thirty-minute ride
Whether bright or melancholy
Rough and ready, finely spun
Whether with a thousand players
Or a lonely cast of one
Every story, new or ancient
Bagatelle or work of art
All are tales of human failing
All are tales of love at heart
This is the story of a love that flourished in a time of hate
Of lovers no tyranny could separate
Love set into motion on the Nile's shore
Destiny ignited by an act of war

Egypt saw the mighty river
As its very heart and soul
Source of life for all her people
That only Egypt could control
Destruction of her southern neighbor justified
Nubia exploited, left with little more than pride
Ohhh...

[Song 85: Tonight]
9 ContributorsTonight Lyrics
Tonight
Do we have to fight again?
Tonight
I just wanna go to sleep
Turn out the light
But you wanna carry grudges
Oh, nine times outta ten
Mmm, I see the storm approaching
Long before the rain starts falling

Tonight
Does it have to be the old thing?
Tonight
Oh, it's late, too late
To chase the rainbow that you're after
I'd like to find a compromise
Ooh, and place it in your hands
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
Oh, and I cannot find the time

Tonight
Just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight
Why not approach with less defiance
The man who'd love to see you smile?
Who'd love to see you smile tonight


Tonight
Just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight
Why not approach with less defiance
The man who'd love to see you smile?
The man who'd love to see you smile
The man who'd love to see you smile
Tonight

[Song 86: Sixty Years On]
13 ContributorsSixty Years On Lyrics
Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave?
And señorita play guitar, play it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through

You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun

And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on (Oh, oh)

Yes, I'll sit with you and talk, let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through

And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on

[Song 87: I Don’t Wanna Go on with You Like That]
12 ContributorsI Don’t Wanna Go on with You Like That Lyrics
I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're braggin' one is not enough
Well, somethin' tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five

I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carvin' up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me, let's a-call it quits

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that

Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's gettin' outta hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads a-faster in a breeze

And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just a-have to quit 'em if you want me back
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that

Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah

Oh, if you wanna spread it around, sister, that's just fine
But I don't want no second hand a-feedin' me lines
If you wanna hold someone in the middle of the night
Call out the guards, turn out the light

And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit 'em if you want me back
No, I don't wanna go on with you like that

Go on with you like that

[Song 88: Ticking]
12 ContributorsTicking Lyrics
"An extremely quiet child" they called you in your school report
"He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught"
So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
To notify your parents of the manner in which you died?

At St. Patrick's every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
"Oh, he's unconcerned with competition, he never cares to win"
But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son

"Now you'll never get to Heaven," Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Grow up straight and true blue
Run along to bed"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
Some gook said, "His brain's just snapped" then someone called the police
You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
Oh, you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground

Promising to hurt no one, providing they were still
A young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed
(You killed)
That gun butt felt so smooth and warm cradled in your palm
Oh, your childhood cried out in your head, "They mean to do you harm"

"Don't ever ride on the devil's knee," Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Pay your penance well, my child
Fear where angels tread"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

Within an hour the news had reached the media machine
A male Caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens
The area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school
Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule

Oh, they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside
"Throw out your gun, walk out slow, just keep your hands held high"
But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door
Oh, you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law

"You've slept too long in silence," Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Crazy boy, you'll only wind up
With strange notions in your head"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

[Song 89: My Father’s Gun]
12 ContributorsMy Father’s Gun Lyrics
From this day on I own my father's gun
We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down below the southern land
It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands
I'll take my horse and I'll ride the Northern plain
To wear the colour of the greys and join the fight again
I will not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun

I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

As soon as this is over we'll go home
To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring

I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company, it needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
Oh
I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat
The riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said now, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

(The riverboat sails tonight)
(That's just fine alright)
Oh, slip us a rope
Sail on round, sail on round, sail on round, sail on round
(Sail)
Sail on round the bend
(The riverboat sails tonight)
Oh, I said
That's just fine alright

It's knowing what they want of me that scares me
It's knowing, having followed, I must lead
It's knowing that each person there compares me
To those in my past whom I now succeed
But how can whatever I do for them now be enough?
Be enough

Aida! Aida!
All we ask of you
Is a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage
To ask more would be selfish, but nothing less will do
Aida! Aida!

Your robe should be golden, your robe should be perfect
Instead of this ragged concoction of thread
But may you be moved by its desperate beauty
To give us new life, for we'd rather be dead
Then live in the squalor and shame of the slave
To the dance!

Aida! Aida!
All we ask of you
Is a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage
To ask more would be selfish, but nothing less will do
Aida! Aida!

Aida...!
Aida! Aida!
Aida! Aida!
Aida!

I know expectations are wild and almost
Beyond my fulfillment, but they won't hear
A word of a doubt or see signs of a weakness
My nigh-on-impossible duty is clear
And if I can rekindle our ancestors' dreams, it's enough
It's enough

Aida! Aida! Aida!
Aida! Aida! Aida!

It's enough!

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...

When I look back upon my life
It's always with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

At school, they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything I long to do
No matter when or whеre or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I'vе ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

Father, forgive me
I tried not to do it
Turned over a new leaf
Then tore right through it
Whatever you taught me
I didn't believe it
Father, you fought me
'Cause I didn't care
And I still don't understand
Still don't understand, yeah

So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done (I've ever done)
Everything I ever do (I ever do)
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin

Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been

My bulldog is barking in the backyard
Enough to raise a dead man from his grave
And I can't concentrate on what I'm doing
Disturbance going to crucify my days
And the days they get longer and longer
And the nighttime is a time of little use
For I just get ugly and older
I get juiced on Mateus and just hang loose

And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

My landlady lives in a caravan
Well, that is when she isn't in my arms
And it seems I pay the rent in human kindness
But my liquor also helps to grease her palms
And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well, I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams

And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well, I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams

And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and I have a heart of gold
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

I'm a genuine example of a social disease

You tell me there's an angel in your tree
Did he say he'd come to call on me?
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

Everybody now, bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away, yeah
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn, burn, burn, burn down the mission walls?

Now everybody, bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission, Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission, Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

[Song 94: Tower of Babel]
10 ContributorsTower of Babel Lyrics
Snow, cement
And ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters tracking down the hours

But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die?

It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl with the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no, no, no

Junk, angel
This closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling your prescription for a brand new heart attack

But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied?

It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl with the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no, no, no

It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl with the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no, no, no

8 ContributorsI Need You to Turn To Lyrics
You're not a ship to carry my life
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love, your love protects my fears

And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold

Did you paint your smile on? Well, I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you
We're related in feeling but you're high above
You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove

And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold

[Song 96: Bad Side of the Moon]
15 ContributorsBad Side of the Moon Lyrics
It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon
Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like a hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue

I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life

There isn't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life

[Song 97: The Greatest Discovery]
10 ContributorsThe Greatest Discovery Lyrics
Peering out of tiny eyes
The grubby hands that gripped the rail
Wiped the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch

A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore

Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded, must be displayed

Large hands lift him through the air
Excited eyes contain him there
The eyes of those he loves and knows
But what's this extra bed just here?

His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing

In those silent happy seconds
That surround the sound of this event
A parent's smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend

And all you ever learned from them
Until you grew much older
Did not compare with when they said
This is your brand new brother
This is your brand new brother
This is your brand new brother

[Song 98: Enchantment Passing Through]
10 ContributorsEnchantment Passing Through Lyrics
To sail away to half discovered places
To see the secrets so few eyes have seen
To see moments of enchantment on our faces
The moments when we smile and those in between

If I could leave this place then I'd be sailing
To corners of my land where there would be
Sweet southern winds of liberty prevailing
The beauty so majestic and so free

I will take you sailing, South.  You can be my guide
(sung)
There'd be no ties of time and space to bind me

And no horizon I could not pursue

I'd leave the world's misfortunes far behind me

I'd put my faith and trusting in something new

But why should I tell you this

A stranger I just met

A woman whom I hardly know at all and should forget

A journey we can only dream of
Enchantment passing through
And how is it I say these things
So easily to you

I'll never take you sailing!  I might never  leave Egypt again!

You talk as though you've been enslaved!  If you don't like your fate, change it!  You are your own master, there are no shackles on you!  So don't expect any pity or understanding from this humble palace slave!

And why did I tell her this?
A stranger I've just met
A woman who I hardly know at all and will forget
Anonymous and gone tomorrow
Enchantment passing through
And all I've done is tell her things
She already knew
She knew ...She knew....

[Song 99: It’s Tough to Be a God]
10 ContributorsIt’s Tough to Be a God LyricsTulio and Miguel sing this song in El Dorado at a party that, the local people mistaking them for gods, was thrown in their honor.
I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
The town's already on its knees
Being worshipped is a breeze
I barely know the words to any hymn

Listen, if we don't comply
With the locals' wishes I
Can see us being sacrificed or stuffed
Let's be gods, the perks are great
El Dorado on a plate
Local feeling should not be rebuffed

It's tough to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be deified when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a terrifying notion
All those prayers and those salaams
Any normal man would bridle
If he's forced to be an idol
And a normal man's exactly what I am

All the same, it's pretty clear
The scoundrels don't keep much up here
They must have zillions under lock and key
But gods can force them to unleash
Enough to make us nouveau riche
Beyond our wildest dreams, so follow me!

Can't you see I won't relax
If religious maniacs
Tell me I'm all-powerful and sublime
How can I be their belief
When I'm lying through my teeth?
Why don't we just say, "some other time"?

It's tough to be a god
But if you get the people's nod
Count your blessings, keep them sweet is my advice
Be nirvana, be salvation
Be all things to all men
Butter up your congregation
Every Sunday score a ten
The alternative is dire
Simply frying pan to fire
So sign on two new gods for paradise, paradise

And that black piano
Oh, that sweet Georgia Peach
And the boy from Tupelo

Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England

Out of Cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground
Crying, 'God, send me a brother'
Not a bloody nose
For rock 'n' roll
Give me that sweet Georgian Peach
And the boy from Tupelo

Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Yeah!

I was made in England
Like a blue Cortina
But a Yankee summer
Had a way about her
You had a scent for scandal
Well here's my middle finger
I had forty years of pain
And nothing to cling to

Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England

If you're made in England
You're built to last
You can still say 'homo'
And everybody laughs
But the joke's on you
You never read the song
They all think they know
But they've all got it wrong

Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England (sing it!)

A single stem, it's 6 a.m.
And foggy on the Hudson
Thorns adorn her baby grand
From Stoney End to London
Words unfold, hair black as coal
Sweet blindness in her eyes
Stoned souls perform at Central Park
In masks of her disguise

A sign inside the times
It's a poison pen they're pushing
Lay your head to rest upon
The pale and purple cushions
Like Virginia to the lighthouse
See the songbirds in their cages
The rose of Laura Nyro
Shed its petal on the pages

Ticking clocks, the orthodox
Tell 'em Eli's coming
Italian girls in Market Square
Where Catholic fears are running
Beads of sweat on Lafayette
Christmas Eve is melting
Dumb as rocks on Monterey
Down Gibsom Street, they're yelling

A sign inside the times
It's a poison pen they're pushing
Lay your head to rest upon

How have I come to this?
How did I slip and fall?
How did I throw half a lifetime away
Without any thought at all?
This should've been my time
It's over, it never began
I closed my eyes to so much for so long
And I no longer can
I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of shift in the stars
But I know the truth and it haunts me
It's flown just a little too far
I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
It's flown just a little too far
Why do I want him still?
Why when there's nothing there?
How to go on with the rest of my life
To pretend I don't care
This should've been my time
It's over, it never began
I closed my eyes to so much for so long
And I no longer can

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of twist in my fate
But I know the truth and it haunts me
I learned it a little too late
I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
I learned it a little too late
Too late

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waitin' to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)

[Song 104: The King Must Die]
12 ContributorsThe King Must Die Lyrics
No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
'Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore

And sooner or later
Everybody's kingdom must end
And I'm so afraid your courtiers
Cannot be called best friends

Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the King must die

Some men are better slaying sailors
Take my word and go
But tell the ostler that his name was
The very first they chose

And if my hands are stained forever
And the altar should refuse me, yeah
Would you let me in, would you let me in, would you let me in?
Should I cry sanctuary?

Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the King must die, yeah

The King must die
The King must die, oh, yeah

No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
'Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore

The King is dead
The King is dead
The King is dead
The King is dead
Long live the King

[Song 105: Mellow]
10 ContributorsMellow Lyrics
Cool grass blowing up the pass
Don't you know I'm feeling mellow?
Oh, I love your roman nose
The way you curl your toes, baby
Make me feel so mellow

It's the same old feeling I get when you're stealing
Back into my bed again
With the curtains closed
Oh, and the window froze
By the rhythm of the rain

Ooh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

Going down to the stores in town
Getting all the things we need
Oh, don't forget the beer
Oh, my little dear
It helps to sow the mellow seed

And it can't be bad, all the love I've had
Coursing through my life
Oh, down in the pass
Where the wind blows fast
And mellow, mellow's feeling right

Oh, I make you mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time


Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time
Oh! You make me mellow
Oh! You make me mellow
Rocking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time

Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week
I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well, she's really going fine for eighty-four
Well, she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl, she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home

Down at the well, they got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah, but that ain't natural, yeah, well, so old Clay would say
You see, he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going back home
And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going back home

Now the old fat goose is flying across the sticks
The hedgehogs done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chairs are creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
It's the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home
Oh, country comfort's in a truck that's going back home, yes, it is
Country com-comfort's in a truck that's going back home

[Song 107: Kiss the Bride]
9 ContributorsKiss the Bride Lyrics
Well, she looked a peach in the dress she made
When she was still her mama's little girl
And when she walked down the aisle, everybody smiled
At her innocence and curls
And when the preacher said, "Is there anyone here
Got a reason why they shouldn't wed?"

I shoulda stuck up my hand
I shoulda got up to stand
And this is what I should have said

I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

Underneath her veil, I could see a tear
Tricklin' down her pretty face
And when he slipped on the ring, I knew everything
Would never be the same again
But if the groom woulda known, he'd have had a fit
About his wife and the things we did

And what I planned to say
Yeah, on her weddin' day
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid

I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

Oh, I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

[Song 108: Come Down in Time]
4 ContributorsCome Down in Time Lyrics
In the quiet silent seconds I, I turned off the light switch
And I, I came down to meet you in the half light the moon left
While a, a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune
A mantle of bright light shone down from a room

"Come down in time", I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
"Come down in time" was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

Well, I don't know if I should have heard her as yet
But a, a true love like hers is a, a hard love to get
And I, I've walked most all the way and I, I ain't heard her call
And I, I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all

"Come down in time", I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
"Come down in time" was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

There are women, women and some hold you tight
While some leave you counting the stars in the night

[Song 109: Better Off Dead]
11 ContributorsBetter Off Dead Lyrics
There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

Well, they've locked up their daughters
And they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease-streaked windows of an all-night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street

'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am then I'll just say "inspired"
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

Ooh (Ooh)
Ooh
Ooh (La, la, la)
Ooh (la, la, la)

Ah
Ah
La-la-la-la-la...

'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead

[Song 110: Original Sin]
8 ContributorsOriginal Sin Lyrics
Oh, it's carnival night
And they're stringing the lights around you
Hanging paper angels
Painting little devils on the roof
Oh the furnace wind
Is a flickering of wings about your face
In a cloud of incense
Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place

I can't eat, can't sleep
Still I hunger for you when you look at me
That face, those eyes
All the sinful pleasures deep inside

Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin

A dream will fly
The moment that you open up your eyes
A dream is just a riddle
Ghosts from every corner of your life
Up in the balcony
All the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand
Blowing theater kisses
Reciting lines they don't understand

[Song 111: Where to Now St. Peter?]
7 ContributorsWhere to Now St. Peter? Lyrics
I took myself a blue canoe
And I floated like a leaf
Dazzling, dancing half enchanted
In my Merlin sleep
Crazy was the feeling
Restless were my eyes
Insane, they took the paddles
My arms they paralyzed

So where to now, St. Peter?
If it's true, I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now, St. Peter?
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on

It took a sweet young foreign gun
This lazy life is short
Something for nothing always ending
With a bad report
Dirty was the daybreak
Sudden was the change
In such a silent place as this
Beyond the rifle range

So where to now, St. Peter?
If it's true, I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now, St. Peter?
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on

I took myself a blue canoe

[Song 112: Written in the Stars (Broadway)]
8 ContributorsWritten in the Stars (Broadway) Lyrics
I am here to tell you we can never meet again
Simple really, isn't it, a word or two and then
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me and wonder what befell
The someone you once loved so long ago so well

Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by
You don't have to ask me and I need not reply
Every moment of my life from now until I die
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Or some god's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day

Marry the princess, Radames.  You can help my people, this could be our chance to do something important!  Don't you see?

(sung)
Nothing can be altered, there is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide

You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned

What it is to be in love and have that love returned

Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time

Or some god's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day

You wore a little cross of gold around your neck
I saw it as you flew between my reason
Like a raven in the night time when you left
I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name
You touched it and you wore it
And you kept it in your pillow all the same

My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird

The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
In the foreign field of death
Wouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight
Instead you moved away

My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird

My high-flying, high-flying bird
My high-flying, high-flying bird
My high-flying, high-flying bird
My high-flying, high-flying bird

There isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue beckoning
The great divide
Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong?
Whose course is braver run?
All I know is all we had
Is over, said, and done
Friends never say goodbye
Friends never say goodbye
Friends never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Friends never say goodbye
Friends never say goodbye
(spoken)
Well, good luck

Yeah, you too

Never say goodbye

10 ContributorsHoliday Inn Lyrics
Boston at last, and the plane's touching down
Our hostess is handing the hot towels around
From a terminal gate to a black limousine
It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn

Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
Where you get to the stage where you're not even tired
Kicking your heels till the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town

Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn

Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn

Oh, I don't even know if it's Cleveland or Maine
With the buildings as big and rooms just the same
And the TV don't work and the French fries are cold
And the room service closed about an hour ago

[Song 117: Goodbye]

The birds can nest again
I'll only snow when the sun comes out
I'll shine only when it starts to rain
And if you want a drink
Just squeeze my hand
And wine will flow into the land
And feed my lambs
For I am a mirror
I can reflect the moon
I will write songs for you
I'll be your silver spoon
I'm sorry I took your time
I am the poem that doesn't rhyme
Just turn back a page
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away

Feet are feeling light
Head on out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?
Ducking up and down

Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool
Just when you think
You're a chain with just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool

Hello, hello
My my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello

Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy
Nothing comes for free
Sniffing on a flower
Run through an autumn shower
Bumping into someone else like me

Hello hello
My my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello

And I could fly on the back of a bird
I could shake all the leaves from a tree
If there's a quest I'm a Knight
Where's there's wrong I'll do right
Two is better than the one I used to be

Hello, hello
My my my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise
Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello (Hello)

The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart, the roving eye
Have come to rest, do not apply
The frantic chase, the crazy ride
The thrill has gone, I step aside
And I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you
The more I want the more I steal
The more I hold the less is real
All worldly things I follow blind
In hope not faith was paid in kind
The line is drawn, the change is made
I come to you, I'm not afraid
And I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you
I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you

Ice skating on the river
With my pretty little black-eyed girl

I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Susie by by by my side

Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine

I'm an old hayseed harp player
I'm the hit of the county fair
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
Living proof as she swirls, she's a dancer, yeah

I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Susie by by by my side

Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine


Well, she sure knows how to use me

Playing hooky with my heart all the time, oh

In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine
Well, she sure knows how to use me

I heard from a friend you'd been messing around
With a cute little thing I'd been dating uptown
Well I don't know if I like that idea much
Well you'd better stay clear I might start acting rough
You out of town guys sure think you're real keen
Think all of us boys here are homespun and green
But that's wrong my friend so get this through your head
We're tough and we're Texan with necks good and red

So it's Ki yi yippie yi yi
You long hairs are sure gonna die
Our American home was clean till you came
And kids still respected the president's name
And the eagle still flew in the sky
Hearts filled with national pride
Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs
Goddammit you're all gonna die

How dare you sit there and drink all our beer
Oh it's made for us workers who sweat spit and swear
The minds of our daughters are poisoned by you
With your communistic politics and them negro blues
Well I'm gonna quit talking and take action now
Run all of you fairies clean out of this town
Oh I'm dog tired of watching you mess up our lives
Spending the summertime naturally high

So it's Ki yi yippie yi yi
You long hairs are sure gonna die
Our American home was clean till you came
And kids still respected the president's name
And the eagle still flew in the sky
Hearts filled with national pride
Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs
Goddammit you're all gonna die
Goddammit you're all gonna die
Oh Lord Goddammit you're all gonna die

Oh, it must be hard for the likes of you
To get by in a world that you just can't see through
And it looks so cold
How does it feel to know you can't go home
How does it feel to know you can't go home

Come on, Razor Face, my old friend
I'll meet you down by the truck stop inn
With a bottle of booze in the back of my car
You're a song on the lips of an aging star
Razor Face, ooh! Amazing grace, protects you like a glove
And I'll never learn the reason why I love your Razor Face

I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose it's like forgetting
Losing who you are
And at the same time, something makes you whole

It's like that there's a music
Playing in your ear
And I'm listening, and I'm listening
And then I disappear

And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

It's a bit like being angry
It's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty and you're full
I don't know what it is, it's hard to tell

It's like that there's some music
Playing in your ear
But the music is impossible
Impossible to hear

But then I feel it move me
Like a burning deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free
Oh, I'm free

[Song 125: Bitter Fingers]
9 ContributorsBitter Fingers Lyrics
I'm going on the circuit
I'm doing all the clubs
And I really need a song, boys
To stir those workers up
And get their wives to sing it with me
Just like in the pubs
When I worked the good old pubs in Stepney
Oh, could you knock a line or two
Together for a friend?
Sentimental, tear-inducing
With a happy end
And we need a tune to open
Our season at Southend
Can you help us?

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das (la-de-da...)
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

I like the warm blue flame
The hazy heat it brings
It loosens up the muscles
And forces you to sing
You know it's just another hit and run
From the tin pan alley twins
And there's a chance that one day
You might write a standard, lads
So churn them out quick and fast
And we'll still pat your backs
'Cause we need what we can get
To launch another dozen acts
Are you working?

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das (la-de-da...)
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das (la-de-da...)
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

(La-de-da...)
Swinging stars, swinging stars
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark-

[Song 126: When Love Is Dying]
7 ContributorsWhen Love Is Dying Lyrics
They say we bruise too easily
I don't know if it's that way for me
I've seen them come, I've seen them go
I've seen everyone I know
Fall in and out of love
It's just the way it goes
Word is out, silence seems so loud
There's no light above or below me now
I've seen it grow, I've seen it live
I've seen everything I give
Falling out my hands, no matter who I'm with

Nobody ever tells you
When love is dying, when love is dying
It just gets a little colder
And we stop trying, we stop trying, yeah we stop trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh when love is dying

There's a pain you never can explain
It cuts so deep time and time again
I felt it then, I feel it now
But nobody told me how
To fight a world of hurt
Somebody help me now

Nobody ever tells you
When love is dying, when love is dying
It just gets a little colder
And we stop trying, we stop trying, yeah we stop trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh when love is dying

But love never gets to show you
And I never got to know you
No we never stood a chance
When love was dying
No and love never makes it easy
And I never got that feeling
No we never stood a chance
When love was dying

Nobody ever tells you
When love is dying, when love is dying
It just gets a little colder
And we stop trying, we stop trying, yeah we stop trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh when love is dying

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh when love is dying

I've figured out where I went wrong
The script not followed then was awfully long
Too much pluck, too little of
The acting right, not actin' up

I've worn the world upon my back
Would someone else but me pick up the slack?
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way

Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinkin' 'bout
Time is wasted lookin' back

Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

You drop a bucket in a well
It's dark and deep down there
Crank the handle, bring it up
The water, crystal clear

I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Lookin' up
Lookin' up
Lookin' up

6 ContributorsSwing For The Fences Lyrics
Go on and swing for the fences
Take a shot at the moon
A dandelion that dances
Takes chances and fancies every little light in the room

Don't hold your shoulders like a high school dance
A white flag holder in a hopeless romance
Red light kids crossing over the line
Breaking step with the times, driving cars through the signs
Be a heartbeat cannon in a quiet spot
A white picket fence in a parking lot
It's a long game and they're gonna tеll you it's not
They're high-five dodgеrs
And, baby, they don't deserve you

Beautiful you
They got nothing on you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Get out of the blue
They got nothing on you

Go on and swing for the fences, oh, yeah
Take a shot at the moon
A dandelion that dances
Takes chances and fancies every little light in the room

Be a heartbeat cannon in a quiet spot
A white picket fence in a parking lot
It's a long game and they're gonna tell you it's not
They're high-five dodgers
And, baby, they don't deserve you

Beautiful you
They got nothing on you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Get out of the blue
They got nothing on you

6 ContributorsFortune Favors The Brave Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh
Fortune favors the brave
Oh, oh
Fortune favors the brave

We have swept to glory
Egypt's mastery expands
From the Nile's northern delta
To the dry, dry southern sands
The more we find, the more we see
The more we come to learn
The more that we explore
The more we shall return

Oh, oh, oh
Fortune favors the brave

It's all worked out, my road is clear
The lines of latitude extend
Way beyond my wildest dreams
Toward some great triumphant end

We seized the day
We turned the tide
We touched the stars
We mocked the grave
We moved into uncharted lands

Fortune favors the brave

The more we find, the more we see
The more we come to learn
The more that we explore
The more we shall return
Nothing is an accident
We are free to have it all
We are what we want to be
It's in ourselves to rise or fall
This is easy to believe
When distant places call to me
It's harder from the palace yard
Fortune favors the free...

Oh, oh, oh

Fortune favors the young...

Oh, oh, oh

Fortune favors the brave!

[Song 130: Have Mercy on the Criminal]
6 ContributorsHave Mercy on the Criminal Lyrics
Have you heard the dogs at night
Somewhere on the hill?
Chasing some poor criminal
And I guess they're out to kill
Oh, there must be shackles on his feet
And mother in his eyes
Stumbling through the devil-dark
With the hound pack in full cry

Have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change?
Don't you hear him any more?
Praying, "Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend"

Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam
While you lie on a cold damp ground?
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt
While the wardens hold you down
And you've never seen a friend in years
Oh, it turns your heart to stone
You jump the walls and the dogs run free
And the grave's gonna be your home

Oh, have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change?
Don't you hear him any more?
Praying, "Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Ooh, sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend"


Oh, have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change?

Sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend"

10 ContributorsAmerican Triangle Lyrics
Seen him playing in his backyard
Young boy just starting out
So much history in this landscape
So much confusion, so much doubt
Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids, mean and dumb
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from

'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

See two coyotes run down a deer
Hate what we don't understand
You pioneers give us your children
But it's your blood that stains their hands
Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent

'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent

'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

7 ContributorsElton’s Song Lyrics
Staring all alone and your grace and style
Cut me to the bone with your razor blade smile
I watched you playing pool
It's all around the school that I love you
I love your gypsy hair and dark brown eyes
Always unprepared for your pointed replies
Cynical and lean
I lie awake and dream about you

If you only knew what I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed to say your name
It's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there
My lips are dry, I catch your eye and look away

Sitting in my room, I've got it bad
Crying for the moon, they think I'm mad
They say it isn't real but I know what I feel and I love you

If you only knew what I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed to say your name
It's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there
My lips are dry, I catch your eye and look away

Sitting in my room, I've got it bad
Crying for the moon, they think I'm mad
But I would give my life for a single night beside you

[Song 133: Your Sister Can’t Twist (But She Can Rock’n’ Roll)]
13 ContributorsYour Sister Can’t Twist (But She Can Rock’n’ Roll) Lyrics

I could really get off being in your shoes
I used to be stone sold on rhythm and blues
I heard of a place at the back of town
Where you really kick the shit when the sun goes down
I really got buzzed when your sister said
"Throw away them records 'cause the blues is dead
Let me take you, honey, where the scene's on fire"
And tonight, I learned for certain that the blues expired

Oh, your sister can't twist, but she can rock and roll
Out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen, but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist, but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist, but she got more soul than me

Somebody help me 'cause the bug bit me
Now I'm in heaven with the aching feet
But I'll be back tonight where the music plays
And your sister rocks all my blues away
I really got buzzed when your sister said
"Throw away them records 'cause the blues is dead
Let me take you, honey, where the scene's on fire"
And tonight, I learned for certain that the blues expired

Oh, your sister can't twist, but she can rock and roll
Out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen, but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist, but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist, but she got more soul than me


Your sister can't surf, but she can rock and roll
She out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen, but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist, but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist, but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist, but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist, but she got more soul than me

Tread on my face if you like, little lady
Turn me inside out if you have to, baby
But don't you cross me off your list
Ooh, I am young and I ain't never been kissed
Never been kissed by a lady called Amy

You're far out, you're fab and insane
A woman of the world, it's quite plain
My dad told me Amy's your name
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game
But he can bust my head 'cause I, I love you all the same

Amy, I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you, I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy


Amy, I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you, I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy

I'm beaten on the streets because I loves you
I watch you go to work in the summer
I don't whistle at you down the street
I would if I could but I can't whistle, you see

Amy, I may not be James Dean
Amy, I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But ooh, Amy, you're the girl that wrecks my dreams
Amy, I may not be James Dean
Amy, I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But ooh, Amy, you're the girl that wrecks my dreams

I pulled out my Stage Coach Times
And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew
The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And I hung my head in shame

Now they've found me
At last, they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord, I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast
The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law

Now they've found me
At last, they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun


Now they've found me
Lord I say at last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Lord, I say now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Lord, I say, now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
And I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Six o'clock alarm
I get the wake up call
Let that sucker jingle-jangle
Ring right off the wall
I'm too low for zero
I'm too tired to work
Tied one on with a friend last night
And wound up losing my shirt

I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero
I wind up counting sheep
Nothing seems to make much sense
It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

Cutting out cups of coffee
Switching off the late night news
Putting the cat out two hours early
It isn't any use
I'm too low for zero
Insomnia attacks
Watching flies with my eyes till sunrise
It's daylight when I hit the sack

I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero
I wind up counting sheep
Nothing seems to make much sense
It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero
I wind up counting sheep
Nothing seems to make much sense
It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

For zero, for zero, for zero
I'm too low for zero
I'm too low for zero
I'm too low for zero
I'm too low for zero
I'm too low for zero
I'm too low for zero

Look out new world here we come
Brave, intrepid and then some
Pioneers of maximum
Audacity whose resumes
Show that we are just the team
To live where others merely dream
Building up a head of steam
On the trail we blaze

Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze

Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-la the promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold the child
On the trail we blaze


The trail we blaze
Is a road uncharted
Through terra incognita to a golden shrine
No place for the traveler
To be faint-hearted
We are part of the sumptuous grand design
(Shangri-la the promised land)
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man before the child
On the trail we blaze

I was sitting in the classroom
Trying to look intelligent
In case the teacher looked at me
She was long and she was lean
She's a middle-aged dream
And that lady means the whole world to me

It's a natural achievement
Conquering my homework
With her image pounding in my brain
She's an inspiration
For my graduation
And she helps to keep the classroom sane

Oh, teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you

I have to write a letter, ooh
Tell about my feelings
Just to let her know the scene
Focus my attention
On some further education
In connection with the birdies and the bees

Oh, so I'm sitting in the classroom, woo!
I'm looking like a zombie
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I've got John Wayne stances
I've got Errol Flynn advances
And it doesn't mean a doggoned thing

Oh, teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you
Oh teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you

Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows

Well, if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two-wheel combination
And I swear it's gonna be the death of me

Oh, you're standing alright
Single, baby? Ah, yeah, that's pretty good
Now, is everybody gonna rock on with me?

Well, everybody wants her, but no one ever gets her

And we were two so much in love forever

And criticized your school girl clothes
But would I then have paced these roads to love you

For seasons come and seasons go
Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
Make Valerie a woman
And Valerie is lonely

No more to roam on the snow hills of Hienton
Undecided with the guardians of the older generation
A doormat was a sign of welcome
In the winter months to come
And in the summer laughing
Through the castle ruins we'd run
For the quadrangle sang to the sun
And the grace of our feeling
And the candle burned low as we talked of the future
Underneath the ceiling
There were tears in the sky
And the clouds in your eyes, they were just cover
For your thighs were the cushions
Of my love and yours for each other

For seasons come and seasons go
Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
Make Valerie a woman
And Valerie is lonely

The songs still are sung
It was fun to be young
But please don't be sad where ever you are
I am who I am
You are who you are

Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman

[Song 144: Please]
6 ContributorsPlease Lyrics
We've been crippled in love
Short changed, hung out to dry
We've chalked on the walls
A slogan or two about life
Stood dazed in the doorway
The king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin
Both of us landing face-down

So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

We've been living with sorrow
Been up, down and all around
We've buried our feelings
A little too deep in the ground
Stood dazed in the doorway
The king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin
Both of us landing face-down

So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

But tied to the same track
The two of us look back
At oncoming trains ahead
How many more times
Can we lay on the line
Watching our love hang by a thread

So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

[Song 145: Wrap Her Up]
8 ContributorsWrap Her Up Lyrics
There are ladies, illegal X's
Mona Lisa's, well connected
They may be shady, English roses
Blue blooded, turned up noses
Money talks, see what it catches
Postage paid, no strings attached
She's a honey, she's a tramp
Roaring twenties, molls and vamps

Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only get one chance
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance
Wrap her up, I'll taker her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up
Give her to me, wrap her up

Is she foreign, legs eleven
Italian girls, take me to heaven
You pretty babies, from Paris, France
Crazy horses, love to dance

[Song 146: Another Pyramid]
7 ContributorsAnother Pyramid Lyrics
While you've been away cavorting
Matters here have moved apace
Now I need you home supporting
All the plans I've put in place
First of all this means your wedding
You'll recall your future bride
For the way that Pharaoh's heading
Time's no longer on our side
According to the hawk god, Horus
Our most regal invalid
Is not that much longer for us
Build another pyramid!
There are many who'll be tearful
As our leader fades away
But our architects are cheerful
And each dog must have its day
If our country is to flourish
Then my son must take the lead
Be our inspiration, nourish
All our hopes our dreams our creed

Soon our monarch will have filled a
Tomb just like his fathers did
Summon Egypt's greatest builders
Re: another pyramid

Build it, build it
Another pyramid

There will be a time for mourning
But for now put plans on hold

Hold

For I give the nation warning
That before the corpse is cold

Cold

We'll extend fair Egypt's power
Egypt's glory strength and style
We shall have our finest hour
Far beyond the mighty Nile

He must have a vault that's grand by
Any standards, floor to lid
Put five thousand slaves on stand by
Build another pyramid!

Build it, build it
Build it, build it
Build it, build it
Build it-
Build it, build it
Build it-

He must have a vault that's grand by
Any standards, floor to lid
Put five thousand slaves on stand by
Build another pyramid!

[Song 147: I Never Knew Her Name]
2 ContributorsI Never Knew Her Name Lyrics
Well, she swept through the church
Like a sweet Sunday prayer
While the choir sang "Son of Heaven"
And the groom just walked on air
I was killing time with Jesus
When the wedding bells began
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Getting married to a handsome man

She walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said "I do" like an angel
But I never knew her name
Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

In the shadow of the holy
Oh, I heard my tell-tale heart
Whisper words that never reached her
As her vows were made at last

Oh, the preacher with his blessing
Pronounced them man and wife
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Make a promise to be kept for life

She walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name
Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

(Ooh-ah!)

She walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name
Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

Like a mystery
Like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name
Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
Oh! I'm in love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name
(Ooh!)
Never knew her name
(Ooh!)
Never knew her name
(Ooh!)
I never knew her name
(Ooh!)

[Song 148: All the Nasties]
13 ContributorsAll the Nasties Lyrics
If it came to pass
That they should ask
What could I tell them?
Would they criticize
Behind my back
Maybe I should let them

Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

If they could face it
I could take it
In their eyes
Oh, I know I'd make it
Their tiny minds
And sacred cows, just fake it

Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

But I know the way
They want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn
Their focus off
To the image in their eyes
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
That a full-blooded city boy
Is now a full-blooded city man

Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul
Oh, my soul, oh, my soul, oh, my soul

[Song 149: Empty Sky]
9 ContributorsEmpty Sky Lyrics
I'm not a rat to be spat on, locked up in this room
Those bars that look towards the sun
At night look towards the moon
Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love
Make me wish that I had wings, take me high above

And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems, oh, so far
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love

And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place, fly!

And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place, yeah

Hey, the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man, yeah

And I looked high and saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place
Fly on

Just send up my love, ain't seen nothing but tears
Now I've got myself in this room for years
I don't see no one, I never see anyone
Anyone, ah yeah
Oh
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Oh-ho-ho
Woo, yeah
I said get down with it, babe
I want you to shh...
Right down now, right down now
Ah...
Oh... get on now
Get on up now

[Song 150: Not Me]
4 ContributorsNot Me LyricsI once knew all the answers
I stood on certain ground
A picture of true happiness
A confidence so effortless
No brighter could be foundOh noI never asked the questions
That trouble me today
I knew all  was to know
Love worn lightly, put on show
My conquests on displayI can't believe he's changingAnd who'd have thought that confidence could die?Oh noNot me, not meNot me, not meThat all I took for granted was a lieOh noNot me, not me  Not me,no not meAnd who'd have guessed I'd throw my world away
To be with someone I'm afraid will sayNot me, not meThis can never be
He's in love
But he's not the only one
Who'll be changed

Why hasn't Radames come to see me again? We're to be married in three days, and yet... Aida, I must make things right with him!

I shall not envy lovers
But long for what they share

An empty room is merciless
Don't be surprised if I confess
I need some comfort
And who'd have thought a love could be so good?
Not me, not me
And show me things I never understood
Not me, not me
And who'd have guessed he'd throw his world away
To be with someone 'til his dying day?
Not me, not meAnd who'd have
Thought a love
Could be so good? And who'd have
