Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
We're far from the shallow now

Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, shallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, shallow
We're far from the shallow now

(Ooh, ooh)

I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

(Ooh, ooh)

Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

Pay the toll to the angels
Drawing circles in the clouds
Keep your mind on the distance
When the devil turns around

Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life

Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance, now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night

"Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-oo-na-na"
In her tongue she said, "Death or love tonight"

Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Feel the beat under your feet, the floor's on firе
Abracadabra, abracadabra

Choose the road on the wеst side
As the dust flies, watch it burn
Don't waste time on a feeling
Use your passion, no return

Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life

Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance, now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night

"Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga

Sing for me a sinful melody

Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down

She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on

So sweet 'til I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Make you crazy when I turn the lights low

(Last night) Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinkin' about you) Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty) All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here (It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here (It was kind of trashy)
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there

Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams
We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought ('Cause I'm broken)
Let's white (By the one before)
Glove the bed (He was kind of nasty)
Help me here (And I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads

Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do (Woo)
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

Don't stop the party (Making love in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Making love in my sex dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, tomorrow when I run into you

You could turn to stone or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and... oh my God!

Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)

Last night
Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not movin' on

In her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name, don't call my name

I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush

Just let me go

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that
Burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad

You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name, don't call my name

Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?

Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?

It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

Don't call me Gaga
I've never seen one like that before
Don't look at me like that
You amaze me
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart (You little monster)
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart out (You amaze me)
Ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart (Hahahaha)
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart (Big boy)

Look at him, ah, look at me
That boy is bad and honestly
He's a wolf in disguise
But I can't stop staring in those evil eyes (Evil eyes, evil eyes)

I asked my girlfriend if she'd seen you 'round before (Oh, yeah)
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor, baby (Uh)
"We might've fucked, not really sure, don't quite recall" (Oh, yeah)
"But something tells me that I've seen him, yeah"

That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)

Put his arms around me
Said, "Boy, no, get your paws right off of me"

I asked my girlfriend if she'd seen you 'round before (Oh, yeah)

I wanna just dance, but he took me home instead
Uh-oh, there was a monster in my bed
We french kissed on a subway train
He tore my clothes right off
He ate my heart and then he ate my brain

Uh-oh (I love that girl)

Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about our future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense
When I got the whole world in front of me?"
So, I said

I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

And I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

And then he asked me, he said, "Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple, it's the way that you love and treat your mother"

Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (If you go with me)
For life (See the world with me)

'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
Russia, UK, Paris, I'm Italian, Asian, かんぱい !
Africa, India, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
Latin-American, I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta, I'm American, I'm gypsy, I'm
Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia, Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, hey

Sit back down on the couch where we

And my lipstick on your face

Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me "Heart of Gold"
With a guitar humming and no clothes

It's my daddy, and Nebraska, and Jesus Christ

How bad, bad do you want me?
You're not the guy that cheats (The guy that cheats)
And you're afraid that she might leave (That she might leave)

"How bad, bad do you want me?"

'Cause you like my hair, my ripped-up jeans

But I got a tattoo for us last week
Even good boys bleed
How bad, bad do you want me? (How bad, bad do you want me?)

'Cause you hate thе crash, but you love the rush
And I'll make your hеart weak every time
You hear my name, 'cause she's in your brain
And I'm here to kiss you in real life
'Bout to cause a scene
How bad, bad do you want me?

You panic in your sleep (Panic in your sleep)
And you feel like such a creep (Feel like such a creep)
'Cause with your eyes closed, you might peek
So hot, hot that you can't speak
You're so fucked up with your crew (Fucked up with your crew)
But when you're all alone, it's true (All alone, it's true)
You know exactly what we'd do

And I'm here to kiss you in real life
'Bout to cause a scene
How bad, bad do you want me?

Uh-oh, oh, you love a good girl

How bad do you want me, for real? (Oh)

Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'

Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission

He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight

[Song 43: Mary Jane Holland]
61 ContributorsMary Jane Holland Lyrics“Mary Jane Holland” The 12th song off of Lady Gaga’s fourth studio album.This song is about an Alter-Ego who comes out during when Gaga gets high off of marijuana.
Lady of the Dam
Won't be a slave to the blonde, or the culture of the popular
(She won't, she won't)
Sing at you, I'll fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil in sight
(I will, I will)

'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me, Mary Jane, in Holland tonight

Mary! (Ah-ah-oh)
Jane! (Ah-ah-oh)
Holland! (Ah-ah-oh)
Woo-hoo!
Mary! (Puff in; Ah-ah-oh)
Jane! (Puff out; Ah, oh)
Holland! (Ah-ah-oh)
Woo-hoo!

I don't like to boast
But our truffles are the most
Mad-magical in Amsterdam
(She won't, she won't)
So if you have fear, Apollo
Sit on my lyre, and play him like a piano man
(I will, I will)

'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me, Mary Jane, in Holland tonight

Mary! (Ah-ah-oh)
Jane! (Ah-ah-oh)
Holland! (Ah-ah-oh)
Woo-hoo!
Mary! (Puff in; Ah-ah-oh)
Jane! (Puff out; Ah, oh)
Holland! (Ah-ah-oh)
Woo-hoo!

I know that Mom and Dad think I'm a mess
But it's alright, because I am rich as piss
When I ignite the flame and put you in my mouth
The grass eats up my insides, and my brunette starts to sprout
Introducing, ladies and gentlemen, Mary Jane Holland!

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight (I think we'd)
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me, Mary Jane, in Holland tonight

Mary! (Ah-ah-oh)
Jane! (Ah-ah-oh)
Holland! (Ah-ah-oh)
Woo-hoo!

[Song 44: ARTPOP]
79 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeARTPOP Lyrics
Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you
Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue
Lovers' kites
Are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose
Could profit you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything
Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

Brushes of darkness won't help you create your destiny of self
But ARTPOP could mean anything
Anything
I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
Music, not the bling

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

Free my mind, ARTPOP
You make my heart stop

Life is so simple
A little boy, a little girl
Laughing and loving
Tryin' to figure out the world
It felt like summer when I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story but tell me again

Nothing you say wouldn't interest me
All of your words are like poems to me
I would be honored if you would take me as I am

I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

I hope you’re still with me
When I’m not quite myself
And I pray that you’ll lift me
When you know I need help
It’s a warm celebration of all of our years
I dream of our story of our fairytale

Family dinners and family trees
Teachin' the kids to say thank you and please
Knowing if we stay together that things will be right

I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

Hold my hand, everything will be okay
I heard from the heavens that clouds have been grey
Pull me close, wrap me in your aching arms
I see that you're hurtin', why'd you take so long

To tell me you need me? I see that you're bleedin'
You don't need to show me again
But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you
I won't let go 'til the end

So cry tonight
But don't you let go of my hand
You can cry every last tear
I won't leave 'til I understand
Promise me, just hold my hand

Raise your head, look into my wishful eyes
That fear that's inside you will lift, give it time
I can see everything you're blind to now
Your prayers will be answered, let God whisper how

To tell me you need me, I see that you're bleedin'
You don't need to show me again
But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you
I won't let go 'til the end

So cry tonight
But don't you let go of my hand
You can cry every last tear
I won't leave 'til I understand
Promise you'll just hold my hand

Hold my hand, hold my—
Hold my hand, hold my hand

Hold my hand, hold my—
Hold my hand, hold my hand

I know you're scared and your pain is imperfect
But don't you give up on yourself

That I would be happy again

Hold my hand, yeah
Hold my hand, oh yeah
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Hold my hand

Last night, we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby, you gave up, you gave up
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans, with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies

Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
On my bubble dreams, bubble dreams
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

And I know that it's so complicated
But I'm a loser in love, so baby
Raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends

I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless (Ah)

Oh, friend, you've left me speechless (Ah)

Would you give it all up? (Oh) Could I give it all up for you? (Oh)
And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up? (Give it all up)
Could you give it all up (Give it all)
If I promise, boy, to you?
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again (Oh)

So speechless (Ah)
You left me speechless, so speechless
Will you ever talk again?
Oh, boy, why you so speechless? (Speechless, baby)
You've left me speechless, so speechless

Some men may follow me
But you choose "death and company"
Why you so speechless?

There ain't no reason you and me should be alone

You wasn't really trappin', servin' birds of yay

Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, your father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
If you've surveyed the way we've acted
Keep it comin', I'm comin' around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down

Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

Everybody want that money, what you want?
High as hell, tryna have some fuckin' fun
I don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine (Shine)
Tried to kick it, just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet events, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passin' 'em freaks (Bitch)

Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
And I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by givin' money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe of a legacy of takin' her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista be goin' in warp speed, breakin' atoms
Blowin' O.G. has got me creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me, now I got her
Because she be ready to party and then move to the club (Yes)
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talkin' about jewels and drugs

Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin; if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred?
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?

Shots were fired on the street

Why do people just stand around?

I've been knockin' 'em down

I can't get back up on my feet
See the lights on the street like stars

But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

Under the foggy day
I’m lookin' for a light
And my only friend
Is workin' tonight

I can’t get myself out of bed
Hear these voices in my head like a song

But look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what I found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

When I met you I was blown to pieces
Heart all over the floor
Ever since you put me back together
I can’t believe it won’t believe it
Uh

Look what you found!
Yeah baby
Look what I found
Someone who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Look what I found
Whoo!

(Make it stop!)
Silicone, saline
Poison inject me
Baby, I'm a free bitch
I'm a free bitch

Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won't walk away, but she won't look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess, she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess
(Tell 'em, girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
(Tell 'em, girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark

Run, run, her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she's howlin' at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a tramp
She's a tramp, she's a vamp
But she still does her dance
She's a tramp, she's a vamp
But she still kills the dance
(Tell 'em, girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark

In the dark
She loves to dance in the dark

She loves, she loves to dance in the dark

Marilyn

Sy-Sy-Sylvia
Tell 'em how you feel, girls
Work your blonde (Jean) Benét Ramsey
We'll haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick
You will never fall apart
Diana, you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together, we'll dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart

Dance in the shadow of a m—

Standing in the shadow of another man
Lonely as the streets pass me by (Oh, oh)
Life ain't under pressure 'cause I got a plan
Starin' at myself in the eye (Oh, oh-oh)

When I get this feelin'
I can't get enough
'Cause I start believin'
And my voice gets tough
Now I got this feelin'
I can't get enough
'Cause I won't be used for my love and left out to cry

I don't wanna fade into the darkness tonight
Show me the light
I don't wanna be the one to fall on the knife
To come alive
I'm about to be there, I'm about to be there
Watch me, I swear
I'll dance in the shadow of a man

Hard to be the yellow in a purple sky (Sky)
Peekin' through the eye of the storm (Eye of the storm)
Gotta be the truth or you'll become a lie (Become a lie)
Piercing like your skin from a thorn (Oh, oh, I)

I can't get enough

And my voice gets tough
Now I got this feelin'

And the boys all pass me by
Talkin' some shit with your hand on my ass

Yeah, you wanna be cool, but you're makin' me mad
Bite my lip, it starts to bleed
Yeah, it tastes so good, but I gotta be bad
If I'm gonna get you home

Gonna make the curtains cream, believe it
Gonna make the ceilin' shake for me
I'ma be your full-time bedroom demon
I'm gonna make you scream, that's a matter of fact
I'll be your fantasy

I'll burn a hole right through your eyes
Lookin' at you like a zombie killah
Hungry for a homicide
If I get you alone under your skin and bone
I'ma try you on for size
I'm 'bout to wear you out like my favorite suit
Wools paralyzed

Gonna make the curtains cream, believe it
Gonna make the ceiling shake for me
I'ma be your full-time bedroom demon
I'm gonna make you scream, that's a matter of fact
I'll be your fantasy

You're music to my eyes
I had to listen just to find you
I like for you to let me sing along
Give you a rhythm you feel

I wanna learn your every line
I wanna fill your empty spaces
I want to play the part to reach your heart
Sing you a song that you feel

Love let your music be mine
Sing while I harmonize
Let your melodies fly in my direction
Take me to your paradise
On a musical ride
I'm in love with your music baby
You're music to my eyes

Your voice is quite a view
I heard a song and then I saw you
I learned the lyrics and knew you were mine
Dance the horizon with you

I wanna sing you a sunrise
And be the dawn I know will move you
I'd like to be the strings on your guitar
Touch me and play what you feel

Love let your music be mine
Sing while I harmonize
Let your melodies fly in my direction
Take me to your paradise
On a musical ride
I'm in love with your music baby
You're music to my eyes

I don't know the tempo
Of my heart's concerto
It all seems like a dream
It's not
I know there's something real out there for me

I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue, every color I choose
But I don't know what love is
But I think it might be you

If I had the courage
I'd know just what to do
Sometimes I have to crawl
And everyday I fall
Tryin' just to stand by you

I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue, every color I choose
But I don't know what love is
But I think it might be you

Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number

It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way sayin' forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For somethin' he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you

Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold

Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothin' more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece
From Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for gettin' what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
I get on my knees and beg you

Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold

I can carry you, but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh

Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme

And think of different ways to keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours with playful, joyish thoughts

We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey I love you
And after all it's just another day

Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet

And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts
I'll laugh in humble ways

Comedy with tragic words
The audience was smilin'
Cheerin' on a scene absurd

I can try to hide behind the makeup, but the show must go on

I feel so crazy
My head is filled with broken mirrors
So many, I can't look away

If I could fix the broken pieces
Then I'd have a happy mistake

A lonely disposition
Portraits of a strung-out girl
How'd I get so addicted
To the love of the whole world?

I could try to hide behind the makeup, but the show must go on

I feel so crazy
My head is filled with broken mirrors
So many, I can't look away
I'm in a bad way
If I could fix the broken pieces
Then I'd have a happy mistake

If I could bottle up a sunny day

And I could hold my heart in a safe place
All I need to breathe

Turn on the music

I touch your face 'cause I see panic, who rang the alarm?
I see you shiverin', your eyes are red, your soul is gone
You're out of breath, tick-tock, tick-tock, you're almost out of time, yeah, yeah
Because at midnight, there's a change in you that I have heard
You've kept this secret for so long, you whisper and it burns
You're out of breath, tick-tock, tick-tock, you're almost out of time, yeah, yeah

You can't hide who you are, 11:59
Your heart's racin', you're growlin' and we both know why
Yeah, we both know why

Turn on the music
Turn off the lights
I wanna feel the beast inside
I know you're hungry, ready to bite
I wanna watch you turn tonight
I wanna feel the beast inside

The girls are scared of you, a legend in your neighborhood
Last week, you left somebody dead, you're so misunderstood
You got your hands a little red, tick-tock, you're out of time, oh yeah, hoo

Your heart's racin', you're growlin' and we both know why

(Need your love drug)

River in my eyes, I've got a poem in my throat
I hear the music and it takes me by surprise
Pictures in my mind, they come on faster than they go
Another round, hopin' this one will make me blind

I know this time
I won't escape these thoughts in my head
I need you tonight
But I'm gonna fight the feelin' instead

I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your love drug
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your love drug

Your love drug

Thought we'd last a lifetime, when I'm mumblin' alone
I taste the last words that you spoke to me like wine
My heart is in a bind, if I could bear it on my own
I wouldn't try so hard to numb what's left behind

I know this time
I won't escape these thoughts that I dread
I need you tonight
But I'm gonna fight the feelin' instead

I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your love drug
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff

Everybody's got to love each other
Stop throwin' stones at your sisters and your brothers
Man, it wasn't that long ago we were all living in the jungle
So why do we gotta put each other down
When there's more than enough love to g-g-go around?

Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out

Dude in a lab coat and a man of God
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Fought over prisms and a forty-day flood
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Well, I say rainbows did more than they've ever done
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
So why do we gotta fight over ideas?
(Aah, aah, aah)
We're talkin' the same old shit after all of these years
(Ayi, yi, yi)

Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out
Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future

Psychic guru catches minnows in the harbor
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
Everyone tells him he should work a little harder
(Come onto mama, come on, mama)
{Hey, man, get to work! Catch 'em!}
They all tell you that freedom must be bought
But baby, he's already caught 'em
So why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in

Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom

I'm a loser, baby, maybe I should quit
I'm a jerk
Wish I had the money, but I can't find work
I'm a brat
I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried
'Til they got divorced 'cause I ruined their lives

I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids

Give me your money or I'll hold my breath

I can't believe all the things that you said
To me tonight, to me tonight, to me tonight
Stars are descending, the streets signs go by
A lonely ride, I need to cry to feel alive

You pull me close and knock me down
Then I beg to come back around
I’m so addicted to your lies, oh
And in the mirror I get weak
At the girl starin' back at me
They're your eyes, they're your eyes

Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care
Don't call tonight, tomorrow, you’ll desert mе

Don’t call tonight, don't call tonight

Saturday morning, my head is on fire
It's hard to blame you for your crimes when I have mine
The sun is risin', but we’re out of light
We twist the knife too many times to say goodbye

You pull me close and knock me down
Then I beg to come back around
I'm so addicted to your lies, oh
And in the mirror, I get weak
At the girl starin' back at me

And you know you're right where you belong
Drivin' home to your favorite song
And you scream so loud, 'cause you're all alone
And your heart beats fast 'cause you're in the zone

It's in time with it

In your brown eyes, I walked away
In your brown eyes, I couldn't stay
In your brown eyes, you'll watch her go
Then turn the record on and wonder what went wrong
What went wrong?

If everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes

In your brown eyes, I was feeling low
'Cause they're brown eyes, and you never know
Got some brown eyes, but I saw her face
I knew that it was wrong, so baby, turn the record on
Play that song

Where everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes
Brown eyes

Everything was everything, but baby it's the last show
Everything could be everything, but it's time to say goodbye
So get your last fix and your last hit, grab your old girl with her new tricks
Honey, yeah, it's no surprise that I got lost in your brown eyes
In your brown eyes

Brown, brown eyes

Got some brown eyes

There's always a joker in the pack
There's always a lonely clown
The poor laughing fool falls on his back
And everyone laughs when he's down
There's always a funny man in the game
But he's only funny by mistake
And everyone laughs at him just the same
They don't see his lonely heart break

They don't care as long as there is a jester, just a fool
As foolish as he can be
There's always a joker, that's the rule
But fate deals the hand that I see

The joker is me, the joker is me
The joker is me, the joker is me
The joker is me

Drink the poison 'cause there's always a loser in the game
The court loves to watch them cry
The royals shout, "This queen needs to sing"
To ruffle the scene of the crime
The king wears a funny suit, he's a clown
The crowd rumbles with their roars
And everyone watches as he declines
The queen pierces him with a sword

I don't care as long as there is a wild man in the deck
As long as I see his frown
Then I won't be lonely, that's a fact
I stand here and wait for his sound, ha, ha, ha

The joker is me, the joker is me
The joker is me, the joker is me
The joker is me

The joker is me
The joker is me

[Song 110: Marry The Night - ”The Prelude Pathétique”: Music Video Intro Speech]
10 ContributorsMarry The Night - ”The Prelude Pathétique”: Music Video Intro Speech LyricsPerhaps, Lady Gaga stated something just in the intro speech of her official Marry The Night music video.
Watch the speech here:"The Prelude Pathétique"- First Part:
When I look back on my life it’s not that I don’t want to see things exactly as they happened, it’s just that I prefer to remember them in an artistic way. And truthfully the lie of it all is much more honest because I invented it. Clinical psychology tells us arguably that trauma is the ultimate killer. Memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics. They can be lost forever. It’s sort of like my past is an unfinished painting and as the artist of that painting I must fill in all the ugly holes, and make it beautiful again. It’s not that I have been dishonest; it’s just that I loathe reality
For example those nurses, they're wearing next season Calvin Klein and so am I. And the shoes custom Giuseppe Zanotti. I tipped their gause caps to the side like Parisian berets because I think it's romantic, and I also think that mint will be very big in fashion next spring
Check out this nurse on the right; she's got a great ass. Bam
The truth is back at the clinic they only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair. And that girl on the left she ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago, they only gave her the gummy bears. I'd wish they'd only given me the gummy bears
"The Prelude Pathétique"- Last Part:
You may say "I lost everything". But I still had my Be-Dazzler. And I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M&J Trimming. So I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do; I did it all over again

I like it rough

Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine

I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside bangin', then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl, loving me's like chewing on pearls

You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough
You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough

Won't go without my fix tonight, it's a little too rough
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines, and she can't get enough

I'm in the bedroom (Bedroom) with tissues and when
I know you're outside bangin', then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life (Hard life) with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl, loving me's like straightening curls

You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough (Oh, yeah)

Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough (Baby likes it rough)
I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough (Baby likes it rough)
I'm shiny and I know it (Is it 'cause you don't mean it?)
Don't know why you wanna blow it (Or because I don't feel it?)
Need a man who likes it rough (Unless it's rough)
Likes it rough, likes it rough (Baby likes it rough)

Like adjust the dotted line, and I'm supposed to sign
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin' down

Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Stunners who let the top back on the Chevy Impala
Hummers and all that, fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars?
But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
Complete swagger, there go the dagger
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after

Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on, so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
Laying down on famous knives, so everybody sees

Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself

Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you

I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note

I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been trying to tell you how I feel, but was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
I'll do it in the swimming pool, so everybody sees

Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Volumes I know will love and save me from myself

Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you

Princess die
I want to see her cry
Princess die
Princess die
We want to watch her cry
Princess die

I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note

I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriend's limo
Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold
With the paparazzi all swarming around
In my Louis Vuitton white buttoned down
Oh, it's not that deep
So bob your head for another dead blonde whose real prince is in heaven
She just wants to sleep

The final act of life will be in my own hands to do
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you
Applaud, pour vous

Can't stop the high, I can’t stop
Can't stop the high, I can't stop

It’s the theme of a riot, can't stop the fight
Hold me closer 'cause I might faint tonight
As the darkness comes on, fear won't subside
As the panic sets in, you close your eyes

Had too much of a good time to go home now
I can't stop the high, I'm freakin' out
Had too much of a trip, gotta shut it down
I can't stop the high, ’cause my life

My life’s gettin' blurry
So fucked up, but the club, it wants me
I’ve had one too many
Should go home but the party wants me
My life's gettin' blurry
So blacked out, but the club, it wants me
I've had one too many
Should go home but the party wants me

I’ve got a feelin' that the DJ might take me home
I've got a feelin' that I won't be alone
Electric venom, yeah, it's rockin' me to the bone
I've got a feelin' that the DJ might take me home

Can't stop the high, I can't stop
Can't stop the high, I can't stop

In the midst of the crowd, hearts start to fly
You scream and you shout as your mouth gets dry
Eyes bleed from the smoke, angels appear
From her beauty, you choke, her lipstick you smear

Had too much of a good time to go home now
I can't stop the high, I'm freakin' out
Had too much of a trip, gotta shut it down
I can't stop the high, 'cause my life

My life's gettin' blurry
So fucked up, but the club, it wants me
I've had one too many
Should go home but the party wants me
My life's gettin' blurry
So blacked out, but the club, it wants me
I've had one too many
Should go home but the party wants me

I've got a feelin' that the DJ might take me home
I've got a feelin' that I won't be alone (Won't be alone, uh)
Electric venom, yeah, it's rockin' me to the bone
I've got a feelin' that the DJ might take me home

Can't stop the high, I can't stop
Can't stop the high, I can't stop the high
Can't stop the high, I can't stop
I can't stop the high, I can't stop it
Can't stop the high, I can't stop (Can't stop)

Woah, woah

Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life

I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen

I am wind and hurricane, the stormy sky and rain
When you run dry, I'll flood your pain
Woah, woah
In between the moments of the lady I've become
A voice speaks through the noise like drums
Rum-pum-pum-pum

But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win

Starry night
Come inside me, like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to Heaven's door
I will fly
On a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix, so you can remind them of the dream I bore

Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but, but then again, no
Or a woman who makes potions on a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world (Ooh hoo)

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of these verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Well anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
It's yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall

'Cause inside, we are really made the same
In life, waiting's just a stupid game

Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves

I'd do anything if you would just believe me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall
If I had a painter's mind, then I would paint it
Or a sculptor's hands, then I would shape it
But instead, I guess I'll sing it in this song

I cry more than I ever sang
Each time, your love seems to save the day

Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand

We were so young, we could grow
Up in the end, it'd be us
We'd take the F by the bus
Where Brooklyn nights set us free

It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

I missed our cheap chandelier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV
The one where the Russians scored?
I love Briggite Nielsen's hair
I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open the last beer
Falling asleep in our tears
Those Brooklyn nights set us free

It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death

I found an old pair of keys in my purse
That opened the walk up we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there, I wanna make it work (Make it work)
I didn't brush my hair and my lashes are falling off
Of seven years of our bad luck dating
I want one last night there, a Brooklyn night affair
A Brooklyn night affair

It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

It's not that I don't wanna love you 'cause I really tried and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu
Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'll both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu

Feet are feeling light
Head on out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?
Ducking up and down
All those crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool

Just when you think
You're chain is just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool

Hello, hello
Hello, hello
My my, what have we here?
What a surprise, What a surprise!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!

Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy
Nothing comes for free
Sniffing on a flower
Run through an autumn shower
I'm better off with someone else like me
Me

Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise, What a surprise!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know

Hello!

And I could fly on the back of a bird
And I can shake all the leaves from a tree
If there's a quest I'm a knight
Where's there's wrong I'll do right
Two is better than the one I used to be

Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise, What a surprise!

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

Here we are together
I've loved you from afar
I've stayed up dreaming all night long
One day, you would have my heart
One day, she would have your heart

Good morning, good morning
Been up the whole night through
Good morning, good morning to you
Good morning, good morning
It's great to stay up late
Good morning, good morning to you

When the inmates began to sleep
The stars were shining bright
Now the warden's on his way
It's too late to say goodnight

So good morning, good morning
Your problem soon smiles through
Good morning, good morning to you
Good morning, morning
Good morning, good morning


Good morning, good morning
Bang-bang, you're black and blue
Good morning, good morning to you
(Nothin' could be grander than to be in Louisiana)
In the morning, in the morning
You're back bеhind the gate, good morning
Good morning to you
(It might be just a zippy if you was in Mississippi)
Whеn we left the movie show, the future wasn't bright
But came the dawn, the show goes on, and I don't wanna say, "Good night"
So say, "Good morning, good morning"
Rainbows are shinin' through
Good mornin', good mornin' to you
Oh, good mornin', good mornin' to you (To you)

Everything that happens in life
Can happen in a show
You can make 'em laugh, you can make 'em cry
Anything, anything can go

The clown with his pants falling down
Or the dance, that's a dream of romance
Or the scene where the villain is mean
That's entertainment
The lights on the lady in tights
Or the bride with a guy on the side
Or the ball where she gives it her all
That's entertainment

The plot can be hot, simply teeming with sex
A gay divorcée who is after her ex
It can be Oedipus Rex
Where a chap kills his mother and causes a lot of bother
The clerk who is thrown out of work
By the boss who is thrown for a loss
By the skirt who is doing him dirt
The world is a stage
The stage is a world of entertainment

That's entertainment
That's entertainment


The doubt while the jury is out
Or the thrill when they're reading the will
Or the chase for the man with the face
That's entertainment
No death like you get in Macbeth
No ordeal like the end of Camille
This goodbye brings a tear to the eye
That's entertainment

Admit it's a hit and we'll go on from there
We played a charade that was lighter than air
A good old-fashioned affair
As I sing this finale I hope it's up your alley

The gag may be wearing a flag
That began with a Mr. Cohan
Hip hooray! The American way
The world is a stage
The stage is a world of entertainment

I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?

Shots were fired down the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
Why do people just stand around?

I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh

Pump it bitch, to the haters a verse
6 inch, lizard skin, alligator, the purse
Shoe game six, six, and steipers and Birks
I like it, I perch
Vixon and viper the first
Viper the first
You like two and a third
Like who is this bird
You like who in the fur
You heard it a her
Little heffa in the flat 10 dollar skirt
Bitch, never spit the stack on the frock of the purse
The buzz of the block, why nah-nah be the word
The stock of the hills
Spit fire flame for real
When I vamp down the catwalk, I pump it for real
Liquorice lipstick, candy coated, the deal

Patent leather

Now walk, now walk, now walk
I wanna see you pump it

Pump this, promote this
I know you notice this skill
Notice these high boots plus the focus could kill
Beauty Bambi, young, determined and willed
No previews, baby, it's only premieres

I don't, I don't kn-know what you want
But I know, kn-know that you don't want
None, no you don't want none of me
No, not today
Not today, boy, don't misbehave
Ok, ok

'Cause it's little A-B, Lady G-A-G-A
Tell your little DJ, better hit that replay
Listen up my nigga when I'm sipping Clicquot
Lemme hit that weed, hey, lemme feel that freak-ay
Finna pop a pill and get that feeling she chased
When I dip and plié
Gimme, gimme leeway
Bitches on my rhythm, off that Heem and he say

Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life (That's life)

I thought of quittin', but my hеart just won't buy it
If I didn't think it was worth a try

On GOAT, a government owned territory in space, a birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place. But the birth was not finite, it was infinite. As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began it was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal. And thus began the beginning of the new race; a race within the race of humanity; a race which bears no prejudice, no judgment but boundless freedom. But on that same day as the eternal Mother hovered in the multiverse another, more terrifying, birth took place: the birth of evil
And as she, herself, split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces, the pendulum of choice began its dance. It seems easy, you imagine, to gravitate, instantly and unwaveringly, towards good but she wondered, “How can I protect something so perfect without evil?”

Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

With distingué traces
That used to be there you could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong
Again I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A troughful of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you I will
And yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush
Life in some small dive

And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too
