[Song 1: The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]
31 ContributorsThe Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia Lyrics
He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said hello, he said, "Hi, what's new?" and Wo said
"Sit down, I got some bad news that's gonna hurt"

Said, "I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you've been gone, she's been seein' that Amos boy, Seth"
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, "Boy, don't you lose your head
'Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself"

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home 'cause he didn't live far
You see, Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Daddy had left him, and that was a gun

He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake

The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag 'em down
A big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
"Why'd you do it?"

The judge said guilty on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
He said, "Supper's waiting at home and I gotta get to it"

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see, little sister don't miss when she aims her gun

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

28 ContributorsFancy Lyrics“Fancy”, Reba McEntire’s southern gothic style hit, is a cover of Bobbie Gentry’s 1969 hit, released as a single in 1991.
The story line of the song follows a woman named Fancy who gives up her life of… Read More 
I remember it all very well looking back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancing dress
Well, Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
Then she painted my eyes and lips (Lips)
Then I stepped into a satin dancing dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it had fit me good
Well, standing back from the looking glass
There stood a woman where a half-grown kid had stood

She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
Then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, "Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death"
She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said
"To thine own self be true"
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high-heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking
Asking Mama, "What do I do?"
She said, "Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you"

She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down now
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown"

Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
It wasn't very long until I knew exactly
What my Mama'd been talking about
I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I was gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might've been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"

It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pouring his tea
In a five-room hotel suite (Yes, she was)
I charmed a king, congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad (She ain't done bad)

Now in this world
There's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites that call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry about nothing
For nigh on fifteen years
Well, I can still hear the desperation
In my poor Mama's voice ringing in my ears

"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Oh, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down, hon'
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown"
Oh, and I guess she did

I was born three months too early
The doctor gave me thirty days
But I must've had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on livin'
Even if this love's to die for
'Cause your bags are packed and I ain't cryin'
You're walkin' out and I'm not tryin' to change your mind
'Cause I was born to be

The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

I don't believe in self-pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
And though my life is changing fast
And who I am is who I wanna be

The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

Oh, a single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
But I must've had my mamma's will and God's
Amazing grace

I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor

[Song 4: Does He Love You]
10 ContributorsDoes He Love You Lyrics
I've known about you for a while now
When he leaves me he wears a smile now
As soon as he's away from me
In your arms is where he wants to be
But you're the one he rushes home to
You're the one he gave his name to
I never see his face in the early morning light
You have his mornings, his daytimes
And sometimes I have his nights

But does he love you? (does he love you?)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you? (does he think of you?)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies?
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?

But when he's with me, he says he needs me
And that he wants me, that he believes in me

And when I'm in his arms, oh he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me, or am I deceiving myself?

Oh, shouldn’t I lose my temper?
Oh, and shouldn’t I be ashamed?
Cause I have everything to lose
And I, I have nothing to gain

But does he love you? (does he love you?)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you? (does he think of you?)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies?
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?

But when he's with me, he says he needs me
And that he wants me, that he believes in me

And when I'm in his arms, oh he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me, or am I deceiving myself?

[Song 5: Angel’s Lullaby]
3 ContributorsAngel’s Lullaby LyricsMidnight moonlight shining through the curtain lace
Paints a perfect picture on your perfect face
One sweet angel sleeping in my arms
You are the promise I knew God would keep
You are the gift that makes my world complete
And you'll never know how much I love you
But I'll keep on telling you my whole life through
Now I believe in miracles, and you're the reason why
So dream on while I sing you my angel's lullaby

[Song 6: I Need To Talk To You]
2 ContributorsI Need To Talk To You LyricsThe whole town would be talking
If someone saw you in here with me
I'm telling you I'd understand
If you feel you need to leave
This room rents by the hour
Oh but I've got it all night long
This is the first time that I've asked you here
It ain't the first time that I've done wrong
I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you
Those pills there on the nightstand
They help make me believe
That the man I'm laying down with
Really cares for me
This book you see me holding
I usually hide in the drawer
I've done my best to put you away
I can't hide from you anymore
I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you

Oh, I've spent my whole life regretting
Each day that I've spent before
It's time that I face the things that I've done
Oh and that's what I came here for
Cause I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you
I need to talk to you

[Song 7: Seven Minutes in Heaven]
2 ContributorsSeven Minutes in Heaven Lyrics
I wouldn't ask Cash why he wore all-black
Or have Elvis sing me a song
I wouldn't ask why Kennedy died
'Cause I know that I wouldn't have long
I wouldn't small talk with Peter about those pearly gates
I'd ask him to let me on in
And I'd say somebody's waitin' on the other side
That I'd really like to catch up with

If I had seven minutes in Heaven
I know just what I'd do
Take a walk down those golden streets
And find a quiet corner booth
I wouldn't spend all my seconds askin' God questions
'Cause He knows I'd be back soon
If I had seven minutes in Heavеn
I'd spend them all with you

How's the fishin' up thеre
Have you been gettin' our prayers
We've been sendin' them every night
The only issue here is oh Lord we miss you
But I swear we're doin' alright
Does the weather get colder?
Do you ever grow older?
Does it feel like the blink of an eye?
I'm so glad to be here
And I sure hope they serve beer
'Cause, for me, it's been a long time

If I had seven minutes in Heaven
I know just what I'd do
Take a walk down those golden streets
And find a quiet corner booth
I wouldn't spend all my seconds askin' God questions
'Cause He knows I'll be back soon
If I had seven minutes in Heaven
I'd spend them all with you

When it's last call, I'll hug you
And I'll tell you, "I love you"
But I won't say goodbye
Right now, I got to leave
But the next round's on me
And I know it won't be the last time

If I had seven minutes in Heaven
Then I know just what we'll do
Oh we'll take a walk down those golden streets
And find that same old corner booth
But I might take a few seconds to ask God some questions
I didn't last time I was through
If I had seven minutes in Heaven
I'd spend them all with you

If I had seven minutes in Heaven
I'd spend them all with you

[Song 8: The Greatest Man I Never Knew]
7 ContributorsThe Greatest Man I Never Knew Lyrics
The greatest man I never knew
Lived just down the hall
And everyday we said hello
But never touched at all
He was in his paper
I was in my room
How was I to know he thought I hung the moon?

The greatest man I never knew
Came home late every night
He never had too much to say
Too much was on his mind
I never really knew him
Well, now it seems so sad
Everything he gave to us took all he had

Then the days turned into years
And the memories to black and white
He grew cold like an old winter wind
Blowing across my life

The greatest words I never heard
I guess I'll never hear
The man I thought could never die
He's been dead almost a year
Oh, he was good at business
But there was business left to do
He never said he loved me
Guess he thought I knew

[Song 9: If You See Him, If You See Her]
10 ContributorsIf You See Him, If You See Her Lyrics
If you see him
Tell him I wish him well
How am I doin'?
Well, sometimes it's hard to tell

I still miss him more than ever
But please don't say a word

If you see him
Oh, if you see him

If you see her
Tell her I'm doin' fine
And if you want to
Say that I think of her from time to time

Ask her if she ever wonders
Where we both went wrong

If you see her
If you see her

Oh, I... I still want her
And I still need him so
Oh, I don't know why we let each other go


If you see her
Tell her the light's still on for her
Nothing's changed
Deep down the fire still burns for him

And even if it takes forever
Say I'll still be here

If you see him
If you see her
If you see him
If you see her

[Song 10: She Thinks His Name Was John]
8 ContributorsShe Thinks His Name Was John Lyrics“She Thinks His Name Was John” is about a woman who had a drunken one-night stand with an HIV-positive man, and eventually develops AIDS as a result.
She can account for all of the men in her past
Where they are now, who they married, how many kids they have
She knew their backgrounds, family and friends
A few she even talks to now and then
But there is one she can't put her finger on
There is one who never leaves her thoughts
And she thinks his name was John

A chance meeting, a party a few years back
Broad shoulders and blue eyes, his hair was so black
He was a friend of friend you could say
She let his smile just sweep her away
And in her heart, though she knew that it was wrong
But too much wine and she left his bed at dawn
And she thinks his name was John

Now each day is one day that's left in her life
She won't know love, have a marriage, or sing lullabies
She lays all alone and cries herself to sleep
'Cause she let a stranger kill her hopes and her dreams
And all her friends say what a pity, what a loss
And in the end, when she was barely hangin' on
All she could say is she thinks his name was John
She thinks his name was John

[Song 11: The Christmas Guest]
4 ContributorsThe Christmas Guest LyricsIt happened one day near December's end
Two neighbors called on an old friend
And they found his shop so meager and lean
Made gay with thousand bows of green
And Conrad was sitting with face a-shine
When he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine
And he said "Old friends, at dawn today
When the cock was crowing the night away
The Lord appeared in a dream to me
And said "I'm coming your guest to be."
So I've been busy with feet astir
Strewing my shop with branches of fern
The table is spread and the kettle is shined
And over the rafters the holly is twined
Now I'll wait for my Lord to appear
And listen closely so I will hear
His step as He nears my humble place
And I'll open the door and look on His face
So his friends went home and left Conrad alone
For this was the happiest day he had known
For long since, his family had passed away
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas Day

But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas Guest
This Christmas would be the dearest and best
So he listened with only joy in his heart
And with every sound he would rise with a start
And look for the Lord to be at his door
Like the vision he had had a few hours before
So he ran to the window after hearing a sound
But all he could see on the snow covered ground
Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn
But Conrad was touched and he went to the door
And he said, "You know, your feet must be frozen and sore
I have some shoes in my shop for you
And a coat that will keep you warmer too."
So with grateful heart the man went away
But Conrad noticed the time of day
And wondered what made the Lord so late
And how much longer he'd have to wait
When he heard a knock, he ran to the door
But it was only a stranger once more
A bent old lady with a shawl of black
With a bundle of kindling piled on her back
She asked for only a place to rest
But that was reserved for Conrad's Great Guest

But her voice seemed to plead "Don't send me away
Let me rest for awhile on Christmas Day"
So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup
And told her to sit at the table and sup
But after she left he was filled with dismay
For he saw that the hours were slipping away
And the Lord hadn't come as he said he would
Then Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood
When out of the stillness he heard a cry
'Please help me and tell me where am I?"
So again he opened his friendly door
And stood disappointed as twice before
It was only a child who'd wandered away
And was lost from her family on Christmas Day
Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad
But he knew he should make the little girl glad
So he called her in and he wiped her tears
And quieted all her childish fears
Then he led her back to her home once more
But as he entered his own darkened door
He knew the Lord was not coming today
For the hours of Christmas had passed away

So he went to his room and knelt down to pray
And he said "Dear Lord, why did you delay?
What kept you from coming to call on me?
For I wanted so much your face to see.'
When soft in the silence a voice he heard
"Lift up your head for I kept my word
Three times my shadow crossed your floor
And three times I came to your lonely door
I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet
And I was the woman you gave something to eat
I was the child on the homeless street
Three times I knocked, and three times I came in
And each time I found the warmth of a friend
Of all the gifts, love is the best
And I was honored to be your Christmas Guest

[Song 12: Because of You]
8 ContributorsBecause of You Lyrics
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die in your sleep)
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(You never saw me)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you

[Song 13: Somehow You Do (From The Motion Picture Four Good Days)]
4 ContributorsSomehow You Do (From The Motion Picture Four Good Days) LyricsThis single was written for the film Four Good Days, about a mother (Glenn Close) trying to nurse her opioid-addicted daughter (Mila Kunis) through a period of sobriety prior to treatment.
So you feel like you've run outta hope
Carrying all that weight
Your back's about to break
And you're standing at the end of your rope
You wanna give up the fight
You see no relief in sight
And it's hard to keep the faith
But the darkest night still finds the day

When you think it's the end of the road
It's just 'cause you don't know where the road's leading to
When you think that the mountain's too high
And the ocean's too wide, you'll never get through
Some way, somehow, somehow you do

So you feel like you're right on the brink
Oh, you're in the battlе alone
And life's punched a holе in your soul
Yeah, you've been brought to your knees
But there's better days up ahead
You'll be back on your feet again
And you're gonna be ok
Oh, the darkest night will find the day

When you think it's the end of the road
It's just 'cause you don't know where the road's leading to
When you think that the mountain's too high
And the ocean's too wide
And you'll never get through
Some way, somehow, somehow you do

'Cause it's those times, it's those times when times get bad
You'll find the strength you didn't know you even had
Somehow you'll get through this

When you think it's the end of the road
It's just 'cause you don't know where the road's leading to
When you think that the mountain's too high
And the ocean's too wide
And you'll never get through
Some way, somehow, somehow you do
Some way, somehow, somehow you do

[Song 14: Consider Me Gone]
9 ContributorsConsider Me Gone Lyrics
Every time I turn the conversation
To something deeper than the weather
I can feel you all but shutting down
And when I need an explanation for the silence
You just tell me you don't wanna talk about it now
What you're not saying is coming in loud and clear
We're at a crossroads here

If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

With you, I've always been wide open, like a window or an ocean
There is nothing I've ever tried to hide
So when you leave me not knowing where you're going
I start thinking that we're looking, we're looking at goodbye
How about a strong shot of honesty?
Don't you owe that to me?

If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

Consider me a memory
Consider me the past
Consider me a smile in an old photograph
Someone who used to make you laugh

If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone
Consider me gone
Consider me gone

Just consider me gone

[Song 15: The Heart Won’t Lie]
6 ContributorsThe Heart Won’t Lie Lyrics
Looking back over the years
Of all the things I've always meant to say
But the words didn't come easily
So many times through empty fears
Of all the nights I tried to pick up the phone
So scared of who might be answering

You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

Because the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
You can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie

Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?

You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

Because the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
You can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie
The heart won't lie

[Song 16: Love Isn’t Love (’Til You Give It Away)]
6 ContributorsLove Isn’t Love (’Til You Give It Away) Lyrics
A smile's not a smile till it wrinkles your face
A bell's not a bell without ringing
A home's not a home when there's nobody there
A song's not a song without singing

And love isn't love till you give it away
Love isn't love till it's free
The love in your heart
Wasn't put there to stay
Oh love isn't love till you give it away

You might think love is a treasure to keep
A feeling to cherish and hold
But love is a treasure for people to share
You keep it by letting it go

Love isn't love till you give it away
Love isn't love till it's free
The love in your heart
Wasn't put there to stay
No love isn't love till you give it away

Cause love can't survive
When it's hidden inside
And love was meant to be shared

Love isn't love till you give it away
Love isn't love till it's free
The love in your heart
Wasn't put there to stay
No love isn't love till you give it away

To chase the rain away

I'll be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on
Be your shelter
When you need someone to see you through
I'll be there to carry you
I'll be there
I'll be the rock that will be strong for you
The one that will hold on to you
When you feel that rain falling down
When there's nobody else around
I'll be

[Song 18: Whoever’s In New England]
8 ContributorsWhoever’s In New England Lyrics
You spend an awful lot of time in Massachusetts
Seems like every other week you've got a meeting waiting there
Business must be booming or could something else
Be moving in the air up there?

You say that it's important for our future
An executive on his way up has got to play the part
And each time duty calls, you gotta give it all
You've got with all your heart

When whoever's in New England's through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late
'Cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you

I hear the winter time up north can last forever
And I've been told it's beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you 'til the world you left behind
Just disappears, I hear

I've packed your bags and left them in the hallway
But before you leave again
There's just one thing you oughta know
When the icy wind blows through you, remember that it's me
Who feels the cold most of all

When whoever's in New England's through with you
Oh, and Boston finds better things to do
Oh, you know it's not too late
And you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you

We lie in the dark I know you're awake
The only sounds are the sounds this old house makes
But, oh, how I long, I long to hear your voice
Desperate to talk, yearning to touch
Burning inside because I want you so much
So I say I need you and leave you no choice

You lie you don't want to hurt me
So you lie, buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do? Maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you
So you lie until you can find a way to say goodbye
You lie

How long until you just can't go on?
And the urge to break loose is just too strong
You should let go that's what you want to do
Oh, but you don't know, you don't know
If it's the right thing to do

You lie you don't want to hurt me
So you lie, buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do? Maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you
So you lie until you can find a way to say goodbye
You lie

[Song 20: I Keep On Lovin’ You]
5 ContributorsI Keep On Lovin’ You Lyrics
Love takes the patience of Job
That's what my Mama always said
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know
That's what the Good Book says
You got to play the cards you got
Who knows what fate is holding
At times you got to go without knowing where you're going

That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you

Lord knows we've had our share of fights
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs
We've had plenty and then some of baby-I'm-gones and turnarounds
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel
Someday we're going to look back
Say look at us now

That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you

Keep on loving you
Through the I-take-it-backs, I-didn't-mean-it-like-that
I'd-never-hurt-yous
Oh, I keep on loving you
Keep on loving you
Through the I-take-it-backs, I-didn't-mean-it-like-that
I'd-never-hurt-yous
Oh, I keep on loving you

[Song 21: If I Had Only Known]
6 ContributorsIf I Had Only Known Lyrics
If I had only known
It was the last walk in the rain
I'd keep you out for hours in the storm
I would hold your hand
Like a lifeline to my heart
Underneath the thunder, we'd be warm
If I had only known
It was our last walk in the rain

If I had only known
I'd never hear your voice again
I'd memorize each thing you ever said
And on those lonely nights
I could think of them once more
And keep your words alive inside my head
If I had only known
I'd never hear your voice again

You were the treasure in my hand
You were the one who always stood beside me
So unaware
I foolishly believed that you would always be there
But then there came a day and I turned my head
And you slipped away

If I had only known
It was my last night by your side
I'd pray a miracle would stop the dawn
And when you'd smile at me
I would look into your eyes
And make sure you know my love
For you goes on and on
If I had only known
If I had only known
Oh, the love I would've shown
If I had only known

[Song 22: Back to God]
4 ContributorsBack to God Lyrics
Oh, have you looked around
Have you heard the sound
Of Mama's crying
Or do you turn away
When you see the face
Of the innocent dying
In these darkest days
Are you not afraid?
That it's too late

You gotta get down on your knees
Believe, fold your hands, and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying
You gotta cry, rain, tears of pain
Pound the floor, and scream His name
'Cause we're still worth saving
Can't go on like this, and live like this
We can't love like this
We gotta give this world
Back to God

Have you lost a love?
Do you feel like giving up?
Has your heart been broken?
Are your kids okay?
Will they come home safe?
Do you lie there hoping?
You can make a wish
You can knock on wood
Ohh, it won't do no good

You gotta get down on your knees
Believe, fold your hands, and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying
You gotta cry, rain, tears of pain
Pound the floor, and scream His name
'Cause we're still worth saving
Can't go on like this, and live like this
We can't love like this
We gotta give this world
Back to God


You gotta get down on your knees
Believe, fold your hands, and beg and plead
Keep on! praying
You gotta cry, rain, tears of pain
Pound the floor, and scream His name
'Cause we're still worth saving
Can't go on like this, and live like this
We can't love like this
You can hope the best
Make a wish
The only answer is
We give this world back to God
Ohh, give it back ...

[Song 23: He Gets That From Me]
6 ContributorsHe Gets That From Me Lyrics
His early morning attitude
You have to drag him out of bed
Only frosted flakes will do

He gets that from me
Yeah, he gets that from me

His curly hair and his knobby knees
The way the sun brings those freckles out
Talk and talk and never miss a beat

Yeah, he gets that from me
He gets that from me

He looks at me with those big brown eyes
He's got me in the palm of his hands
And I swear sometimes
It's just like you're here again
He smiles that little crooked smile
There's no denying he's your child
Without him, I don't know what I'd do

He gets that from you
Oh, he gets that from you

How he loves your old guitar
Yeah, he's taught himself to play
He melts my heart
Tells me he loves me every day
And cracks a joke at the perfect time
Makes me laugh when I want to cry
That boy is everything to me

He gets that from you
He gets that from you

Last night I heard him pray
"Lord, help me and Momma make it through
And tell Daddy we'll be okay"

He said he sure misses you
He sure misses you
He really misses you
He gets that from me

[Song 24: You Never Gave Up on Me]
5 ContributorsYou Never Gave Up on Me Lyrics
There's only one chance in a million
Of a dream like this coming true
And I've been told I'm not the one
By everyone but you

Through all my doubts and all my fears
Well, it seemed those clouds wouldn't ever clear

You never gave up on me
Oh, you never gave up on me
I'm here, where I was always meant to be
I never gave up 'cause you never gave up on me

As I stand here and look around me
And think of how far we've come
Your faith, it still astounds me
Oh, just look at what we've done

You've held me high up off the ground
Every time this old world tried, tried to bring me down

You never gave up on me
Oh, you never gave up on me
I'm here, where I was always meant to be
I never gave up 'cause you never gave up on me

Everyone needs someone
Someone to believe like you believed in me

You never gave up on me
No, you never gave up on me
Right here, where I was always meant to be
I never gave up 'cause you never gave up on me
You never gave up on me

Thank you, Mama

[Song 25: Is There Life Out There]
10 ContributorsIs There Life Out There Lyrics
She married when she was twenty
She thought she was ready, now she's not so sure
She thought she'd done some living
Now she's just wondering what she's living for
Now she's feeling that there's something more

Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?

She's always lived for tomorrow
She's never learned how to live for today
Oh, she's dying to try something foolish
Do something crazy or just get away
Oh, something for herself for a change

Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?

There's a place in the sun that she's never been
Where life is fair and time is a friend
Would she do it the same as she did back then?
Oh, she looks out her window and she wonders again

Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?
Oh, is there life out there?
Oh, oh

Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?
Oh, she doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?

3 ContributorsYou’re Gonna Be (Always Loved By Me) Lyrics
6lbs and 9oz. looking up at me
Like I have all the answers
I hope I have the ones you need
I've never really done this
Now I know what scared is
Sometimes I'll protect you from everything that's wrong
Other times I'll let you just find out on your own
But that's when you'll be growing
And the whole time I'll be knowing

You're going to fly with every dream you chase
You're going to cry
But know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair
But if you hang in there
You're going to see that sometimes bad is good
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees
But always loved by me
You're going to be

I'm afraid you'll have to suffer through
Some of my mistakes
Lord knows I'll be trying
Oh, to give you what it takes
What it takes to know the difference
Between getting by and living

Because anything worth doing is worth doing all the way
Just know you'll have to live with all
The choices that you make
So make sure you're always giving way
More than you're taking

You're going to fly with every dream you chase
You're going to cry
But know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair
But if you hang in there
You're going to see that sometimes bad is good
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees
But always loved by me
You're going to be

Someone's everything
You're going to see
Just what you are to me

You're going to fly with every dream you chase
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees
But always loved by me
You're going to be
Always loved by me

She held him close, then she kissed his face
He said it just has to be this way
Yours is the heart, I'll always keep
I'm not gone even if I leave

If you love me, don't you be afraid
To look in my eyes and open up the gate
Then watch me ride beneath a newborn Sun
Just like them horses when it's time to run

He said jockey mountain is callin' me
Gonna take a walk up where I can see
Turn and face that western wind
Oh and I'll be home again

If you love me, don't you be afraid
To look in my eyes and open up the gate
Then watch me ride beneath a newborn Sun
Just like them horses when it's time to run

She held his hand, he took one last breath
Then she walked out to the front porch step
Stared at the sky, tears on her face
And she swore she could hear him say

If you love me, don't you be afraid
To look in my eyes and open up the gate
Then watch me ride beneath a newborn Sun
Just like them horses when it's time to run

2 ContributorsTrailblazer Lyrics
Everybody needs a hero
Somebody who can show 'em the ropes
You gave a match like me a little kerosene
With every song you wrote
I'm lucky to have someone to lean on
When the weeds get high
A little Louisiana twang and some Oklahoma rain
And a heart that just won't lie

Oh, I know a cowgirl when I see one
And I'm sure proud to be one

Talk about a trailblazer
Cuttin' one path at a time
Runnin' like a dream chaser
Livin' on a prayer and a rhyme

You put a flag in the ground to a country sound
To the rhythm of your own highway
Talk about a trailblazеr
I'm rollin' down the road you paved

I saw 'em on thе Opry
I heard 'em on the radio
They taught me how to write, how to hold on tight
In this rhinestone rodeo
It was Dolly and Loretta
Patsy and Tammy, too
They gave me a seat at the table
So I'm savin' one for you

Talk about a trailblazer
Cuttin' one path at a time
Runnin' like a dream chaser
Livin' on a prayer and a rhyme

You put a flag in the ground to a country sound
To the rhythm of your own highway
Talk about a trailblazer
I'm rollin' down the road you paved

God said, "Let there be country music"
He made good ol' country girls like us to do it

Talk about a trailblazer
Cuttin' one path at a time
Runnin' like a dream chaser
Livin' on a prayer and a rhyme

You put a flag in the ground to a country sound
To the rhythm of your own highway
Talk about a trailblazer
I'm rollin' down the road you paved

Oh, thank you, trailblazers
I'm rollin' down the road you paved

[Song 29: Why Haven’t I Heard From You]
9 ContributorsWhy Haven’t I Heard From You Lyrics
Well, back in 1876 an old boy named Bell
Invented a contraption that we know so well
By the 1950's, they're in everybody's home
As a crazy little thing they call the telephone
Now there's one on every corner, in the back of every bar
You can get one in your briefcase, on a plane or in your car

So tell me why (Why), haven't I (Haven't I) heard from you (Why haven't I heard from you?)
Tell me why (Why), haven't I (Haven't I) heard from you (Why haven't I heard from you?)
I say now, "Darlin' (Darlin'), honey (Honey), what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?"

Well, there's no problem gettin' to me
Baby, you can dial direct
I got call forwarding and call waiting
You can even call collect
The service man, he told me that my phone is working fine
And I have come to the conclusion trouble isn't with my line
I'm sure the operator will be glad to put you through
So dial zero for assistance if this all confuses you

So tell me why (Why), haven't I (Haven't I) heard from you (Why haven't I heard from you?)
Tell me why (Why), haven't I (Haven't I) heard from you (Why haven't I heard from you?)
I say now, "Darlin' (Darlin'), honey (Honey), what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?"

There better been a flood, a landslide of mud
A fire that burns up the wires
And thunder so loud with a black funnel cloud
A natural disaster I know nothin' about

So tell me why (Why), haven't I (Haven't I) heard from you (Why haven't I heard from you?)
Tell me why (Why), haven't I (Haven't I) heard from you, yeah (Why haven't I heard from you?)
I say now, "Darlin' (Darlin'), honey (Honey), what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?"
Tell me why (Why), haven't I (Haven't I) heard from you (Why haven't I heard from you?)
Tell me why (Why), haven't I (Haven't I) heard from you (Why haven't I heard from you?)
I say now, "Darlin' (Darlin'), honey (Honey), what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?"

4 ContributorsWhat Do You Say Lyrics
Stuck at a red light outside an adult bookstore
His son said, "Daddy, what are all those X's for?"
As the light turned green he changed the subject fast
Started talking about football as they drove right past

So what do you say in a moment like this
When you can't find the words to tell it like it is
Just bite your tongue and let your heart lead the way
Let's get out of here
Oh, what do you say?

Seventeen years old
She was out with her friends
They started drinking at some party
Until she was three sheets to the wind
Her momma always told her she could call no matter what
She was crying on the front steps
When her mom showed up


Sometimes you got to listen to the silence
And give yourself a little time to think
Her every breath is weaker than the last
And lately when she sleeps she talks about the past
Her husband knows she's tired of holding on
She looks at him and says, "I want to go home!"


Just close your eyes and let your heart lead the way
Oh, what do you say?
Oh, what do you say?

3 ContributorsSing It Now Lyrics
Well I have sung "Amazing Grace" since I was just a child
And I've joined in on "It Is Well" at least a thousand times
And singin' "Jesus Loves Me" is a precious memory
I remember when "Just As I Am" first brought me to my knees
Oh, but here I am surrounded by some things I can't explain
But the truth is still the truth in the moments my heart breaks

And if I could sing it then
I can sing it now
'Cause who He was is who He is beyond the shadow of a doubt
I might be standing in the darkness, with trouble all around
Bit if I could sing it then
I can still sing it now

Oh, it's not always easy to join those melodies
But how sweetly they remind me of what I still believe
A voice that's raised in times like these may be the truest praise
'Cause I've never been forsaken and that will never change

And if I could sing it then
I can sing it now
'Cause who He was is who He is beyond the shadow of a doubt
I might be standing in the darkness, with trouble all around
Bit if I could sing it then
I can still sing it now

"Great Is Thy Faithfulness"
A mighty fortress is our God
"Standing on the Promises"
"Blessed Assurance" Jesus is my...

And if I could sing it then
I can sing it now
'Cause who He was is who He is beyond the shadow of a doubt
I might be standing in the darkness, with trouble all around
Bit if I could sing it then
If I could sing it then
Well I can still sing it now
How sweet the sound that saved a wretch just like me

I said I'd be a good wife
When I put on this ring
I drive a new Mercedes
Play tennis with the ladies
And buy all the finer things
But all that don't mean nothing
When you can't get a good night's loving

Oh, little rock
Think I'm going to have to slip you off
Take a chance tonight and untie the knot
There's more to life than what I've got
Whoa oh, little rock
You know this heart of mine just can't be bought
I'm going to find someone who really cares a lot
When I slip off this little rock

Well, I wonder if he'll miss me
He doesn't even kiss me
When he comes home at night
He never calls me honey
But he sure loves his money
And I'm the one who pays the price
But when he finds this ring he'll see
He keeps everything but me

Oh, little rock
Think I'm going to have to slip you off
Take a chance tonight and untie the knot
There's more to life than what I've got
Oh, little rock
You know this heart of mine just can't be bought
I'm going to find someone who really cares a lot
When I slip off this little rock


Oh, you little rock
Think I'm going to have to slip you off
Take a chance tonight and untie the knot
There's more to life than what I've got
Oh, little rock
You know this heart of mine just can't be bought
I'm going to find someone who really cares a lot
When I slip off this little rock

Little rock, oh yeah

8 ContributorsStronger Than the Truth Lyrics
I never dreamed of wantin' more
Than a small town, simple life
A little money in our pockets
You’re my husband, I'm your wife
But then I fell in icy water
Standing in the grocery line
I overheard my name and yours
And one I did not recognize

Now everything I thought I knew is walking out the door
There's a bottle on the table tellin’ me the only thing I know for sure

Is there's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence
There's not a blade sharper than a lie
There's not a low lower than being the last one to know
You got a brand new start with someone new
And there's no whiskey stronger than the truth

You never think it'd be your story
When you're pulling the wool off your eyes
You know, you think you know somebody
Then you don't and you don’t know why

Havin’ me another won't make the clock rewind
But I’m drinking every drop, knowing what I'm looking for I'll never find

There's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence
There’s not a blade sharper than a lie
There's not a low lower than being the last one to know
Oh, you got a brand new start with someone new
And there's no whiskey stronger than the truth

The only thing I can do
Is pour a glass and pretend
That this pain's gonna end

There's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence
There's not a blade sharper than a lie
There's not a low lower than being the last one to know
Oh, you got a brand new start with someone new
And there's no whiskey stronger than the truth
No, there's no whiskey stronger than the truth

I overheard a conversation, your name was mentioned in
But they didn't talk about us, only her again
I didn't want to listen, but I hung on every word
They said some things I wish I hadn't heard

Rumor has it, she has you
Rumor has it, you love her too
Talk is cheap but the price is high when it's true
Rumor has it, she has you

This town's so small, a whisper can be heard a mile away
And people here will gossip when there's nothing else to say
I wouldn't have believed my ears, but I see it in your eyes
The stories going around this town aren't lies


Whoa! Rumor has it she loves you

First they tell you you're gonna be the next big thing
Put roses in your dressing room every time you sing
Till you ask for a little consideration
Then they call you a diva
Pink slip "termanation"
They grab the next yapper
Just walking down the street
They've got him singing your songs
Mark in your tree
It's lonely at the top
When the lights go down and the cheering stops
You've got no real friends
No place to call home!
It's all good doggie
But no bone1 (no no no bone!)
And the next thing you know they ain't bringing you roses
It's all cold stares
Cold shoulder
"Cold noses"
He doesn't write
Doesnt call
Doesn't howl you name
All that he can think about is fortune and fame
There ain't nothing I can do

To turn his head and excite him
Sometimes I swear I just want to bite him!
Its lonely at the top
When the lights go down
And the cheerin stops
You've got no real friends
No place to call home
It's all good doggie (good doggie)

But no bone! wowow nonono!wow

5 ContributorsFreedom Lyrics
I'm no stranger to the thick smoke of a bar
And heart chained to a bottle of whiskey
And I've held strangers in my arms
To pull apart the bars because I couldn't find the key

I've searched high and low
Been to Hell and back
Been a prisoner to my soul
And all I know is that
The price of being free
It don't come cheap

That's why people fight for it, rise for it
Burn up the night for it
Cry for it, pine for it
Cross rivers wide for it
Once you've held the truth
There's nothin' you won't do
And when I look into your eyes
I know why people died for it
Freedom, loving you feels like freedom

You're the red, the white, the blue
The stars that cover the scars
When we broke the shackles
And I've never been to war before
But your boots there on the floor
Are proof that I've won the battle

And all you had to give to me
Was the gift of being free

That's why people fight for it, rise for it
Burn up the night for it
Cry for it, pine for it
Cross rivers wide for it
Once you've held the truth
There's nothing you won't do
And when I look into your eyes
I know why people died for it
Freedom, loving you feels like freedom

I've searched high and low
Been to Hell and back
Been a prisoner to my soul
And all I know is that
The price of being free
It don't come cheap

That's why people fight for it, rise for it
Burn up the night for it
Cry for it, pine for it
Cross rivers wide for it
Once you've held the truth
There's nothing you won't do
And when I look into your eyes
I know why people died for it
Freedom, loving you feels like freedom
Oh, freedom, loving you feels like freedom
Freedom, loving you feels like freedom

[Song 38: The Fear Of Being Alone]
5 ContributorsThe Fear Of Being Alone LyricsWe ordered up one more bottle of wine
You told me your story I thought about mine
You said when you lost her you lost everything
It all started having a familiar ring
So I asked you to take me some place quiet
We wound up at the river for the rest of the night
Somewhere around the break of day
I could hear it coming from a mile away
So don't say that word
Not the one we both heard too much
You may think you do but you don't
It's just the fear of being alone
Reckless hearts can clear a path
Wider than a hurricane's aftermath
We've both traveled down that road
Where in the name of love anything goes
So don't say that word
Not the one we both heard too much
You may think you do but you don't
It's just the fear of being alone
Like a child in the night
With no one to hold you
And tell you everything's going to be all right

I must admit it's been fun
But that's no reason to jump the gun
If this is real time will tell
So let me bite my tongue and remind myself
So don't say that word
Not the one we both heard too much
You may think you do but you don't
It's just the fear of being alone

[Song 39: All Dressed Up (With Nowhere to Go)]
2 ContributorsAll Dressed Up (With Nowhere to Go) Lyrics
The sign says families welcome
At the Oaks Retirement Home
But mostly no one comes 'cept on the weekends
Ruby Wilson lives in 303
Where she spends most her time
But it's almost noon on Sunday
She's been sitting in the lobby since nine

She's all dressed up
In her best hat and gloves
She's all dressed up
She's watching and waiting, but nobody comes
Some days sure are lonely days
Oh, and time can move so slow
When you're all dressed up
With nowhere to go

As Ruby watches all the others
Leaving with their families
The nurse tells her it's time to come to dinner
She says she's expecting company
They're just running late
But the nurse knows the truth too well
She just sighs and walks away

She's all dressed up
In her best hat and gloves
She's all dressed up
She's watching and waiting, but nobody comes
Some days sure are lonely days
And time can move so slow
When you're all dressed up
With nowhere to go
Oh, with nowhere to go

[Song 40: Forever Love]
6 ContributorsForever Love Lyrics
The first time I laid my eyes on you I knew
We'd spend this life side by side
I still feel the same though you're so far away
I swear that you'll always be my

Forever love
I promise you
Someday we'll be together
Forever love
I won't give up
No matter what
I'll be waiting for you
Forever love

Minutes and hours and years may go by
But my heart knows nothing of time
So don't cry, just keep me right there
In your dreams
And hold on to these words of mine


Love is the road to our destiny
Nothing can change what is meant to be

[Song 41: And Still]
5 ContributorsAnd Still LyricsThousands of people live in this town
And I had to run into him
When I saw him there on that busy street
Those feelings came back again
There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
He walked up to me, looked in my eyes
And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still
He said how have you been
It's great to see you again
You're really a sight for sore eyes
I said I can't complain
Oh, I'm doing fine
We talked as the people rushed by
We laughed about old times and all we went through
That's when he hugged me and said I've missed you
And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still

That's when she walked up to him
He said this is my wife
I gave my best smile
But I was dying inside
He said we've got to go now
It's getting late
It was so good to see you
Then they walked away
And still
My world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still

[Song 42: For My Broken Heart]
5 ContributorsFor My Broken Heart Lyrics
There were no angry words at all
As we carried boxes down the hall
One by one, we put them in your car
Nothing much for us to say
One last goodbye and you drove away
I watched your taillights
As they faded in the dark
I couldn't face the night in that lonely bed
So I laid down on the couch instead

Last night, I prayed the Lord my soul to keep
Then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you
But oh, this sun is blinding me
As it wakes me from the dark
I guess the world didn't stop
For my broken heart

Clock's still ticking, life goes on
Radio still plays a song
As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place
And it takes all the strength I've got
To stumble to the coffee pot
The first of many lonely mornings I have to face
You call to see if I'm okay
I look out the window and I just say

Last night, I prayed the Lord my soul to keep
Then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you
Lord, this sun is blinding me
As it wakes me from the dark
I guess the world didn't stop
For my broken heart
Oh, I guess the world ain't gonna stop
For my broken heart

5 ContributorsGod and My Girlfriends Lyrics
I know he was made just for me
Two hearts that fit perfectly
He gives me love-more then enough
But way before he came along
There was somebody else making me strong
There is no doubt
I’d be nothing without

God and my girlfriends
They’re always there when
I’m feeling down, always around, lifting me up
I love how they know me, forgive me, and show me
Again and again, I can depend
On God on and my girlfriends

They were there when I walked down the aisle
And again when my first baby smiled
Good times and bad, happy or sad
What would I do if I didn’t have

God and my girlfriends
They’re always there when
I’m feeling down, always around, lifting me up
I love how they know me, forgive me, and show me
Again and again, I can depend
On God on and my girlfriends

Anywhere, anytime of the day
Just a prayer or a phone call away

God and my girlfriends
They’re always there when
I’m feeling down, always around, lifting me up
I love how they know me, forgive me, and show me
Again and again, I can depend
On God on and my girlfriends

[Song 45: Going Out Like That]
6 ContributorsGoing Out Like That Lyrics
It's been awhile since she put that red dress on
And slipped into those high heels
She's got a couple of new guys blowing up her phone
And she loves the way that that feels
You'd never know she was going through a break up
There ain't a single tear messing up her make up

He thought she'd be sitting home crying
But she ain't goin' out like that
She's had enough of feeling like dying
She ain't goin' out like that
Everybody, here comes the life of the party, yeah, she is
He might have left her brokenhearted
But she ain't goin' goin out like that

She's got her hands up dancin' like the floor's on fire
Yeah she's the hottest thing in here
Guess she finally got tired of being sick and tired
Now she's lookin like she don't care
If she was hurting, well she must've forgot
She's smiling while she's throwing back shots

He thought she'd be sitting home crying
But she ain't goin' out like that
She's had enough of feeling like dying
She ain't goin' out like that
Everybody, here comes the life of the party, yeah, she is
He might have left her brokenhearted
But she ain't goin' goin out like that

He thought she'd be sitting home crying
But she ain't goin' out like that
She's had enough of feeling like dying
She ain't goin' out like that
Everybody, here comes the life of the party, yeah, she is
He might have left her brokenhearted
But she ain't goin' goin out like that

Everybody, here comes the life of the party
Everybody, here comes the life of the party, yeah, she is

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
I'd drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I would understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a, a better man

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Oh, 'cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
Oh, to come home

If I were a boy
I think I would understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a, a better man
And I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you'll wish you were a, a better man
Oh, you don't listen to her
And you don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

But you're just a boy

[Song 47: Meanwhile Back At The Cross]
2 ContributorsMeanwhile Back At The Cross LyricsThe devil laughed and said I've won
God has lost his only son
The brightest star no longer shines
Finally his world is mine
Then he gathered all his demons near
Said we have conquered love with fear
Meanwhile back at the cross
All is not lost
Forgiveness is bought with each drop of his blood
That falls to the ground
Mercy abounds
As Mother Mary's tears fall down
To see her precious son pay the cost
The devil said we'll use their pride
We'll attack them from inside
Fill their hearts with vanity
Til their differences are all they see
Black and white, rich and poor
To justify their holy war
Meanwhile back at the cross
All is not lost
Forgiveness is bought with each drop of his blood
That falls to the ground
Mercy abounds
As Mother Mary's tears fall down
To see her precious son pay the cost

Take a look around
Turn on the evening news
The devil said there's no way in hell
Am I gonna lose
Hate is everywhere
Love cannot be found
It took me two thousand years
But it's almost over now
Meanwhile back at the cross
All is not lost
Forgiveness is bought with each drop of his blood
That falls to the ground
Mercy abounds
As Mother Mary's tears fall down
To see her precious son pay the cost
At the cross

[Song 48: On My Own]
4 ContributorsOn My Own Lyrics
So many times I said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying there beside him
On my own, on my own, on my own
So many promises never should be spoken
Now you know what loving him costs
Now you're even talking divorce
And you weren't even married
On my own
Once again I'm
One more time by myself
No one said it would be easy
But it once was so easy
Well I believe in love now here I stand
You wonder why

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

So many times I know I could have told you
That losing him would cut like a knife
He walked out and there went your life
I don't want to live without him

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again
I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

You've got to find out where you belong again
Your hear is saying that it's time again
And I know you're going to shine again

[Song 49: Tammy Wynette Kind of Pain]
8 ContributorsTammy Wynette Kind of Pain Lyrics
This ain't a little mascara running down my cheek
And this ain’t a little scratch that'll heal in a couple of weeks
This is more than a little smile I'm having to fake
’Cause this ain't no little girl heartache

Standing by your man
That's a broken plan
When he breaks your heart and all your trust
With his two cheating hands
So it's D-I-V-O-R-C-E
And you don't want him to see you crying
So you're crying in the rain
And this is Tammy Wynette
We're talking Tammy Wynette kind of pain

There's a sky full of tears and every single note
And every single word is wine and whiskey-soaked
So I guess it’s me and her, together in this all alone
’Til I can make it on my own

Standing by your man
That's a broken plan
When he breaks your heart and all your trust
With his two cheating hands
So it’s D-I-V-O-R-C-E
And you don't want him to see you crying
So you're crying in the rain
And this is Tammy Wynette
We're talking Tammy Wynette kind of pain

Standing by your man
Well that’s a broken plan
When he breaks your heart and all your trust
With his two cheating hands
And it's D-I-V-O-R-C-E
Means this golden wedding ring
Don't mean a thing
Oh this is Tammy Wynette
This is Tammy Wynette
We're talking Tammy Wynette kind of pain

7 ContributorsOne Promise Too Late Lyrics
I would have waited forever
If I'd known that you'd be here
We could have shared our lives together
And held each other close all through the years
But I've met someone before you
And my heart just couldn't wait
So no matter how much I adore you
I've got to stand behind the promise that I made

Where were you when I could have loved you?
Where were you when I gave my heart away?
All my life
I've been dreaming of you
You came along one promise too late
You came along one promise too late

I won't say that I'm sorry that I met you
I can't have you but I never will forget you

Where were you when I could have loved you?
Where were you when I gave my heart away?
All my life
I've been dreaming of you
You came along one promise too late
You came along one promise too late
Where were you when I could have loved you?
Where were you when I gave my heart away?
All my life
I've been dreaming of you
You came along one promise too late
You came along one promise too late

[Song 51: Bobby]
4 ContributorsBobby Lyrics
Bobby pleaded guilty to the charges that they read
As they led him from the courtroom, a young voice turned his head
A little boy dressed in blue was standing at the rail
He said, "I hope they kill you, I hope you go to hell"
They locked Bobby in a jail with forty other men
They all knew what he'd done, they were glad to take him in
They'd all seen the headlines about Bobby and his wife
How they loved each other, and how he took her life
Day after day, he sat alone
Night after night, they'd hear him sing his song, he'd sing

Baby, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around
I am not afraid of what people say or do
The only thing I fear is being here without you

The little boy dressed up in blue grew up to be a man
When he fell in love himself, he came to understand
How it was that Bobby took the life they both adored
'Cause Bobby couldn't stand to see her suffer anymore
He took out the papers from the trunk beneath his bed
And all the years just disappeared as through his tears, he read
The stories of the accident that robbed his mama's mind
And the man who held her in his arms and chose to cut the line
And the one about the man who sits alone
Year after year, singing his song

Baby, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around
I am not afraid of what people say or do
The only thing I fear is being here without you

The young man drove his car up and parked outside the gate
They led him to a cold gray room, the guard told him to wait
When the guard brought Bobby in, the young man finally knew
He still missed his mama, but he'd missed his daddy too
When the guard left the two of them alone
He took Bobby in his arms, and the young man sang a song

Daddy, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around
You have taught me not to fear what people say and do
And the only thing that hurts is being here without you

[Song 52: The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter]
6 ContributorsThe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter LyricsShe came in looking good and looking around
She's checking out every man in the room right now
Now don't go telling her about right or wrong
She's been alone way too long
And the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lasting comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon lights
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight
She hears him say- "Hey can I buy you a drink"
Then sees the pale white circle where he wears his ring
She knows that he is dealing her a dangerous hand
The consequences of a one night stand
But the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lasting comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon lights
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight

From somewhere deep inside she tells him "no"
Before she starts to cry she turns to go
Cuz the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lasting comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon lights
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight

2 ContributorsMy Sister Lyrics
Hey girl, it's me, I just called to tell you hi
Call me when you get this
Haven't talked lately so hard to find the time
Give the boys a big kiss
Tell them that I miss them
By the way, I miss you too

I was thinking just today
About how we used to play
Barbie dolls and make-up
Tea parties, dress up
I remember how we'd fight
We'd make up and laugh all night
Wish we were kids again
My sister, my friend

Oh yeah, before I forget I met someone
I think I really like him
I was wondering if I'm jumping the gun
By going out on a limb
And invite him home for Christmas
To meet the family

Seems like just yesterday
You brought home - oh, what's his name?
He had been drinking
What were you thinking?
After dinner he passed out
We can laugh about it now
'Cause we've learned a lot since then
My sister, my friend

Do you think you could come and see me sometime soon?
We could just hang out like we used to

It's late and I should go
But I can't hang up the phone
Until I tell you
What I don't tell you enough
Even though at times it seemed
We were more like enemies
I'd do it all again
My sister, my friend

[Song 54: Fallin’ Out Of Love]
7 ContributorsFallin’ Out Of Love Lyrics
He says he loves her, what can you say to that
He's made up his mind and there isn't nothing you can do
And as you swallow hard, maybe you drive all night
Trying to figure out where the whole thing started going wrong

And in the silence something begins to unravel
You never knew him like you'll be knowing him now

Falling out of love and back into your life
Pulling your heart out from under the knife
Closing the door on all those dreams you used to know
Falling out of love and back on your feet
Turning away from that dead end street
Finding out that nothing feels as good as letting go

That's when he called you up out of the blue one day
And you know he thinks he's talking to the girl you used to be
So when you tell him he's just a memory
Isn't it funny how his voice cracks when you're saying goodbye



Oh and nothing feels as good as letting go
He said he loved her

[Song 55: The Last One to Know]
8 ContributorsThe Last One to Know Lyrics“The Last One to Know” topped Billboard’s Hot Country Singles chart for a week in December of 1987.
I didn't see the fire burn to ashes
Couldn't feel the winds of change
I was lost inside the passion
Blinded by a memory of a flame
Guess I should have felt it when you touched me
Should have seen it in your eyes
I believed you really loved me
Why can't I believe you said goodbye

Why is the last one to know
The first one to cry and the last to let go
Why is the one left behind the one left alone
With no one to hold
The last one to know

Now it would be easier to face the morning
If you were holding me tonight
But you left me without a warning
Holding on to a heartache while she's holding you tight

Why is the last one to know
The first one to cry and the last to let go
Why is the one left behind the one left alone
With no one to hold
The last one to know

Kiss me and the flame rolls higher
Show me all the love you know
Hold me never let me go
I never thought I'd be
Wrapped in the words
Of your sweet, sweet love
But here you are with me
This is what dreams are made of

I can see forever in your eyes
I can see a love that never dies
When you lay me down I realize
I can see forever in your eyes

Take me in your arms tonight
Love me with all your might
Give me all my heart can hold
Hold me never let me go
Love was mystery
Until you touched me with sweet, sweet love
Now it's so clear to me
This is what love is made of

I can see forever in your eyes
I can see a love that never dies
When you lay me down I realize
I can see forever in your eyes
I can see forever in your eyes
I can see a love that never dies
When you lay me down I realize
I can see forever in your eyes

8 ContributorsSomebody Should Leave LyricsSomebody Should Leave became Reba McEntire’s second number-one hit on Billboard’s Hot Country Singles chart, staying on the chart for a week in May of 1985.
It sure gets quiet
When the kids go to bed
We lay here in the silence
Putting off what must be said

I read a book, you watch T.V
As our love dies quietly
I'm so sad
I don't know what I've just read

Somebody should leave
But which one should it be
You need the kids and they need me
Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We keep hoping somehow
We might need each other again

You say goodnight
And turn and face the wall
We lie here in the darkness
And the tears start to fall

If it's only you and me
Goodbye might come more easily
But what about
Those babies down the hall

Somebody should leave
But which one should it be
You need the kids and they need me
Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We keep hoping somehow
We might need each other again

I want your loving more and more
I want your kisses that's for sure
I die each time
I hear the sound
They're saying here he comes
He's Cathy's Clown

You know you've got to stand tall
You know a man can't crawl
And when you let her tell you lies
And you let them pass you by
You're not a man at all

She doesn't want your loving anymore
She doesn't want your kisses that's for sure
Why do you let them put you down
And let them call you Cathy's Clown

When you see me shed a tear
Then you know that I'm sincere
I just think it's kind of sad
That she's treating you so bad
And I'm the one who cares

I want your loving more and more
I want your kisses that's for sure
I die each time
I hear the sound
They're saying here he comes
He's Cathy's Clown

You're Cathy's Clown
You're Cathy's Clown

[Song 60: Maggie Creek Road]
4 ContributorsMaggie Creek Road Lyrics
Mama stood on the front porch ringing her hands
Watched the tail lights fading on his black Trans Am
With her precious little baby taking off inside
Staring at him with stars in her eyes
She tried to tell her but the girl might as well have been deaf
She wasn't going to listen to a word she said

Don't go down Maggie Creek Road
With a boy looking like that
He'll tell you things that you want to hear
And there'll be no turning back
There's an oak tree down by the lake
In the shade where the wild flowers grow
What'll happen only heaven knows
So don't go down Maggie Creek Road
Don't go down Maggie Creek Road

Was a steel black night as dark is cold
Nobody heard her when she said no
She kicked and screamed and got free somehow
Tore her dress on the door when he pushed her out
She walked 13 miles on the gravel road
With tears in her eyes 20 years ago

Don't go down Maggie Creek Road
With a boy looking like that
He'll tell you things that you want to hear
And there'll be no turning back
There's an oak tree down by the lake
In the shade where the wild flowers grow
What'll happen only heaven knows
So don't go down Maggie Creek Road
Don't go down Maggie Creek Road

Somehow mamas always know
Cause they should have been home an hour ago
When she pulled up, it was just going down
She turned her headlights off, didn't make a sound
She heard her baby crying no but he wouldn't stop
Her heart went cold and her blood ran hot
With a pistol in her hand, she opened his door
You don't want to see mama go to war

Don't go down Maggie Creek Road
With a boy looking like that
He'll tell you things that you want to hear
And there'll be no turning back
There's an oak tree down by the lake
In the shade where the wild flowers grow
What'll happen only heaven knows
So don't go down, I said don't go down
Maggie Creek Road

Oh, don't go down
Maggie Creek Road
Oh, don't go down
Maggie Creek Road
Maggie Creek Road

[Song 61: What Am I Gonna Do About You]
5 ContributorsWhat Am I Gonna Do About You Lyrics
The kid down the street mows the grass every week
The neighbor next door fixed the roof where it leaked
Job's going fine and the bills are all paid
And everyone thinks that I'm doing OK
There's a guy down at work
He's asked me out once or twice
I haven't said yes
But I'm thinking I might
And on my way home
I thought I saw you walk by
If only I could get you out of my mind

What in the world am I going to do about you?
Oh, your memory keeps coming back
From out of the blue
Oh, well I try
And I try
But I still can't believe that we're through
So tell me what in the world am I going to do about you?
What am I going to do about you?

I went to the store
But it wasn't much fun
It doesn't take long when you're shopping for one
Standing in line
I thought I saw you walk in
And that's when it started all over again

What in the world am I going to do about you?
Oh, your memory keeps coming back
From out of the blue
Oh, well I try
And I try
But I still can't believe that we're through
So tell me what in the world am I going to do about you?
What am I going to do about you?

[Song 62: I’ve Waited All My Life for You]
4 ContributorsI’ve Waited All My Life for You Lyrics
Don't you know
That you are the one
I would like to live my life through
I cannot see anyone with me but you
I want to go where you go
And share the things you do
For I have waited all my life for you
I have heard tales
That true love comes
Only once in a life time
And this time is the last time for me

For I just cannot imagine
Being in love with someone new
Because I have waited all my life for you

So here it is
All the love
That I have saved for a lifetime
Never touched
Never crushed
And never used
And to think that I would ever find you
It is impossible but true
Because I have waited all my life for you

For I just cannot imagine
Being in love with someone new
Because I have waited all my life for you

[Song 63: Only in My Mind]
6 ContributorsOnly in My Mind Lyrics
On a park bench in the middle of July
We sat and watched the children play
If it was the heat or the noise
He didn't have too much to say
Then with a move of his eyes
A move that could have made the wind stand still
He took my hand in his and said the words
That I never will forget

He said, "Have you ever cheated on me?
Has there been someone else?
Is there someone you love more than me?
Someone you can't forget?
Get his memory in the open again
Let it be chased away by time"
He said, "Have you ever cheated on me?"
I said, "Only in my mind"

How can I tell him the time we spent together
Was time between friends?
There's just some things I can talk about with you
That I can't just talk to him
How can I tell him that somewhere in the cards
It was meant for us to meet?
Why am I blushing in front of him now?
Is it you or the heat?

He said, "Have you ever cheated on me?
Has there been someone else?
Is there someone you love more than me?
Someone you can't forget?
Get his memory in the open again
Let it be chased away by time"
He said, "Have you ever cheated on me?"
I said, "Only in my mind"

"Darling, have you ever cheated on me?"
And I said, "Only in my mind"

7 ContributorsYou’re the First Time I’ve Thought About Leaving Lyrics
I've seen you smile more than I thought you would
And I smiled back a little more than I should
And lately at night while he's sound asleep
I'm thinking things that I shouldn't think

You're the first time I've thought about leaving
And I really don't know what I'll do
You're the first time I've thought about leaving him
I've never known someone like you

Sometimes I wait when I really should go
Lord only knows what I do that for
When I get home and he holds me close
I try not to think what I'm thinking most

You're the first time I've thought about leaving
And I really don't know what I'll do
You're the first time I've thought about leaving him
I've never known someone like you

I've never known someone like you

5 ContributorsTill You Love Me Lyrics
I sent you roses, I warned you I would
Do all that I could to show you the way that I feel
Please, don't say I'm wasting my time
I've got nothing but time so I'll do all that I can to catch
That ghost of a chance

The sunlight, the moonlight
Are beyond my control
And there are stars in the heavens
That I'll never hold
But if dreams give you power
Then I'm strong enough to offer my heart
And never give up till you love me
Until you love me

I looked in your eyes, so bright and so blue
And that's when I knew that you could be mine
If good things come to those who will wait
Well, I guess I can wait if that's what I have to do
Oh, it's worth it for you

Should I stumble again? Still I'm caught in your grace

Your will above all else, my purpose remains
The art of losing myself in bringing you praise
Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, your glory goes beyond all fame
My heart and my soul, I give you control
Consume me from the inside out Lord
Let justice and praise, become my embrace
To love you from the inside out

And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise
From the inside out, Lord my soul cries out

5 ContributorsWhen You Love Someone Like That Lyrics
Ooh, hey

I think it was me, it must have been me
I guess I did something wrong
I tried too hard, wanted too much
I guess that's why he's gone
I lost my pride, I falled and cried
I felt like a little kid
What's wrong with me?
I still can't believe I did the things I did

I couldn't change him
He was gonna break my heart
I saw it coming
Yeah, I knew it from the start

When you love (When you love)
When you love someone like that
When you give what you can't take back
When you love (When you love)

When you love someone like that

Girl, it ain't right, it just ain't right
Don't tell yourself that it was you
You followed your heart, you gave it your best
There's nothing more you can do
Guys like him are like the wind
And you know it's just too bad
They blow in and out again
And never know what they had

Girl, I can tell you
He'll do the same to someone else
It ain't about you
So don't be so hard on yourself

'Cause when you love (When you love)

You talked me into moving in and giving you my key
You said you'd be a mess now if it hadn't been for me
You said I stole your heart away by looking in your eyes
I wonder now, how many times you sold that pack of lies

If this is how you act when you give your heart away
Well, take it back
Take it back

You told me I was everything you wanted and more
Then tell me what you're doing now sneaking out the back door
You're bringing home flowers and a bottle of Chablis
You forgot I don't drink wine I know that bottle's not for me

If this is how you act when you give your heart away
Well, take it back
Take it back

Oh, you must think I'm blind
And I don't smell your new cologne
You don't think I notice
All the nights I spend alone

Well, I'm not one for sitting around in some old pity pool
You think you got a ticket and I must be some kind of fool
I hate to steal your thunder but your playing days are through
At least they are for me because babe, I got no use for you
Tonight laying on the street
Babe, your bag is packed
So, take it back

Oh, you must think I'm blind
And I don't smell your new cologne
You don't think I notice
All the nights I spend alone

Well, I'm not one for sitting around in some old pity pool
You think you got a ticket and I must be some kind of fool
I hate to steal your thunder but your playing days are through
At least they are for me because babe, I got no use for you

She's up on the barstool
Out drinkin' like a mad fool
Everybody 'round here knows what it does to her
A dark cloud up above her
It's all over a lover
All the signs are sayin' it's gonna get worse

There she goes a-throwing back
A storm in a shot glass

Here comes the lightning flashes
Here comes the thunder crashes
Here comes the tears like falling rain
And it ain't gonna blow through fast
Gonna be hours before it's passed
Wouldn't sit there and I sure wouldn't ask
Better step back, that's a storm in a shot glass

That poor bartender
He sure remembers
What happened last time when she rolled in
Tell the band to step it up
No songs about breaking up
And the last thing you'd wanna do is mention him

Oh Lord, it's a jack black
Storm in a shot glass

Here comes the lightning flashes
Here comes the thunder crashes
Here comes the tears like falling rain
And it ain't gonna blow through fast
Gonna be hours before it's passed
Wouldn't sit there and I sure wouldn't ask
Better step back, that's a storm in a shot glass

Better run for cover
She just ordered another

Here comes the lightning flashes
Here comes the thunder crashes
Here comes the tears like falling rain
Here comes the lightning flashes
Here comes the thunder crashes
Here comes the tears like falling rain
And it ain't gonna blow through fast
Gonna be hours before it's passed
Wouldn't sit there and I sure wouldn't ask
Better step back, that's a storm in a shot glass

Storm in a shot glass
Storm in a shot glass
Now, I wouldn't sit there if I was you
Storm in a shot glass, yeah

How I got out of some desperate situations
Turned around at the end of a dead end road
The devil got my tongue every time I went to pray
Didn't know what to ask or know what to say
Oh heaven only knows how to save a stubborn soul like me
There must be an angel on my shoulder
Whispering in my ear
Thank God, the angel on my shoulder
Knows it ain't good for me to be alone down here
Never looking forward, but I'm always finding trouble
Good at digging holes, don't even have a shovel
I get myself into something, something always helps me out
Make another promise there ain't gonna be a next time
Then I turn around, I'm back in the same bind
Crying out please, "Somebody come and rescue me"
Must be an angel on my shoulder
Whispering in my ear
Thank God, the angel on my shoulder
Oh, knows it ain't good for me to be alone down here
Oh, must be an angel on my shoulder
Oh, whispering in my ear
Thank God, the angel on my shoulder
Oh, knows it ain't good for me to be alone down here

Angel on my shoulder
Whispering in my ear
Hey, thank God, the angel that's on my shoulder
Knows it ain't good for me to be alone down here
Oh, no, I don't need to be alone down here, oh no

My heart stopped dead in its tracks
Across the room
I could see him there
A ghost from my past
But he's too caught up to notice me
She must be his new love
I never dreamed that it would hurt this much
It's just
I know how he feels
How warm his touch is
Oh, how he feels
How soft his kiss is
And it cuts right down to the bone
Because I let him go
I know how he cares
How strong his love can be
When he believes its real
Oh, I've been there
I know how he feels
As long as I kept him out of sight
I kept from going out of my mind
Tried to believe
That leaving him was somehow justified
But tonight there's no denying
What a love like his is worth
He once looked at me
The way he's looking at her
What a lucky girl

I know how he feels
How warm his touch is
Oh, how he feels
How soft his kiss is
And it cuts right down to the bone
Because I let him go
I know how he cares
How strong his love can be
When he believes its real
Oh, I've been there
I know how he feels
And it's killing me
Oh, I know how he feels

6 ContributorsRing On Her Finger, Time On Her Hands LyricsI stood before God, my family and friends
And vowed that I'd never love anyone else again, only him
As pure as my gown of white I stood by his side
And promised that I'd love him until the day I died
Lord, please forgive me even though I lied
Because you're the only one who knows just how hard I tried
I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in me needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands
When I add up all the countless nights I cried myself to sleep
And all the broken promises you somehow failed to keep
He can't blame me
He's the one who left me too many times alone
In a three bedroom prison I tried to make a home
My love slowly died but the fire inside still burned
And the arms of a stranger was the only place left to turn
I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in me needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands

I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in me needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands

[Song 74: Somebody]
8 ContributorsSomebody Lyrics
At a diner down on Broadway they make small talk
When she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cup
He jokes about his love life
And tells her he's about ready to give up
That's when she says, "I've been there before
But keep on looking because maybe who you're looking for is"

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a stranger's face instead
It's that blue-eyed girl from two floors up
Maybe she's the one maybe he could fall in love with

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
A moment they'd both missed until that day
When he saw his future in her eyes
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why he searched so long
When she was always there at that diner waiting on

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there
Oh, somewhere out there is somebody

[Song 75: Cactus in a Coffee Can]
8 ContributorsCactus in a Coffee Can Lyrics
She had the window and I had the aisle
She looked 25, but she was shaking like a child when we took off
I looked over and clutched in her hand
There was a cactus in a coffee can
She was holding that thing like it was all that she had
She smiled at me, but I could tell she was sad

Somewhere over Denver, I asked her her name
She said "Elena," and told me she came from Santa Fe
She ordered a drink and a wall came down
She started talking and pain poured out
She told me a story I'll never forget
She had me in tears when she looked at me and said

"My mama's first love was crack
She made her living lying on her back
And she gave me away on the day that I was born"

She said, "The last ten years I spent tracking her down
It don't seem fair that when I finally found her she was almost gone
We had two weeks together to laugh and to cry
Two weeks to say hello and goodbye
She gave me this cactus, said, 'It's kinda like me
It'll hurt you to hold it, but it blooms every spring'"

She said, "I'm on my way back to New Mexico
Was gonna scatter these ashes where the desert winds blow
But I came up with a better plan
I'm gonna keep 'em in the bottom of this coffee can"

"My mama was a tortured soul
I still love her even though
Oh, she gave me away on the day I was born"

The plane touched down and we both got off
I took her hand and said, "I'm sorry for your loss"
She said, "Thanks for listening, and for being here
I've been wantin' to talk about for so many years"
Now I'll probably never see Elena again
We met as strangers and parted as friends
As we waved goodbye, I was sure of one thing
There'll be a flower on that cactus come next spring

I disappoint you so
And how you keep forgiving me

And need love desperately
You are always there for me

Like an oak in the wind
Like an old familiar friend
Like a harbor in a wild and raging sea
Darling you are always there for me

When I take your love for granted
Like I often do
It's not that I don't need you so
It's not I don't love you
It's just that I'm a fool sometimes
Just too blind to see
That you are always there for me

Like an oak in the wind
Like an old familiar friend
Like a harbor in a wild and raging sea
Darling you are always there for me
Like an oak in the wind
Like an old familiar friend
Like a harbor in a wild and raging sea
Darling you are always there for me

6 ContributorsHow Was I To Know Lyrics
My world revolved around you
Every word was a promise I was hanging on
Swept up inside a whirlwind
I just couldn't see the end until you were gone
I thought I would fall apart
With shattered dreams and a broken heart
Scrambling in the dark

How was I to know
That I'd be OK
Thought I'd lose it all when you walked away
How was I to know
I would be this strong
I had what it takes all along
How was I to know

What I was so afraid of
Turned out to be my freedom in disguise
Now I know what I'm made of
Guess it just took some time to realize
I was blind I couldn't tell
Put too much faith in someone else
Gave up on myself

[Song 78: I’d Rather Ride Around With You]
6 ContributorsI’d Rather Ride Around With You Lyrics
My cousin's getting married at the Methodist church
That's why I stayed home from work
I'm supposed to hold the flowers
When the new bride kisses the groom
That's what I'm supposed to do
So what are we doing with the windows rolled down
Twenty five passionate miles from town
I love her like a sister baby but to tell the truth

I'd rather ride around with you

The guy she's going to marry has got money to burn
His daddy's a partner in some big law firm
Yeah that's how they're going
To Hawaii on their honeymoon
First class to Honolulu
She's never even set foot on a jet
I'm a little bit jealous I confess
I'd like to fly to Hawaii
But honey, if I had to choose


I don't care where this road goes
No, I don't want to turn around
Let go of the wheel, feel the wind blow
Don't even think about slowing down
They're tying tin cans to the back of the car
Wondering where in the world we are
The preacher's done praying
And the couple's done saying I do
That could be me and you
There's way too many decisions to make
The length of the dress
The layers on the cake
One of these days I might get married too

[Song 79: Strange]
6 ContributorsStrange Lyrics
I laid there feeling sorry for myself
In a bed of Kleenex
Stuffing chocolates in my mouth
On the phone with my best friend
Cussing my ex
He broke my heart
Felt like the world had ended
I cried myself to sleep
Thinking I can't get over him

Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love
Strange

Got half a mind
To spend my whole pay check
On one of those dresses
The strapless black ones
That are so famous
For teaching lessons

Drop by his place
Pick up the rest of my things
He'll tell me I look good
I'll laugh and say, yeah I will in time

Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love
Strange
Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love

Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, strange

He tells me he's workin' late
He tells me that he can't stay too long
So I turn the lights off
I fall asleep before he's home
Tomorrow, I'll wake up alone
Feelin' that familiar low, my heart screams

Enough
But every time I think I've had enough
He comes around and wraps me up in love
And I wind up givin' in
'Cause he gives me just enough
To make me think that there's still hope for us
But in the end, it's only me
Wishin' I could be
Wishin' I still was
Enough

He thinks it's best to tell me lies
He don't even try to hide the truth
So he won't hurt me
He made a promise he can't keep
He can't promise anything
The half of him he gives to me will never be

Enough
But every time I think I've had enough
He comes around and wraps me up in love
And I wind up givin' in
'Cause he gives me just enough
To make me think that there's still hope for us
But in the end, it's only me
Wishin' I could be
Wishin' I still was

Enough to make him wanna stay
Enough to make him walk away
I just wanna hear him say my love's

Enough
To make me think that there's still hope for us
But in the end, it's only me
Wishin' I could be
Wishin' I still was
Enough
I know I'll never be
Oh, I know I never was
Enough

Enough
Oh, I'm wishin' I could be
Know I'll never be
Oh, enough (Enough)
Enough, enough
Oh, enough
Never be

[Song 81: What If It’s You]
2 ContributorsWhat If It’s You LyricsI've got something to tell you that I just can't say
So I'm writing it down in case maybe someday
Our lives take a turn down a road
We can't see right now
I know you're happy and I'm happy for you
But since you found each other
I've been so confused
Because I believe there's one soul on this earth
That was meant for mine
I was sent here to find
What if it's you
What if our hearts were meant to be one
What will I do
Knowing that I'll never love anyone
As much as I do love you
What if it's true
What if it's you
If destiny called and I missed my cue
Do I get one more chance
Oh, how I wish I knew
I'll never again put my heart in the hands of fate
If it's too late
What if it's you
What if our hearts were meant to be one
What will I do
Knowing that I'll never love anyone
As much as I do love you
What if it's true
What if it's you

If I ever hold you I'll never let go
But if I never do how will I know
What if it's you
What if our hearts were meant to be one
What will I do
Knowing that I'll never love anyone
As much as I do love you
What if it's true
What if it's you
What will I do
What if it's true
What if it's you

[Song 82: Hallelujah, Amen]
4 ContributorsHallelujah, Amen Lyrics
It's a Sunday mornin' choir just a little off-key
First kiss wasn't what you'd thought it'd be
The call you got that you thought could only be a bad dream
Your only child leavin' home when they turn eighteen
Breakin' up ends up bein' the best thing
When you realize what you want ain't what you need

Hallelujah for the heartache
Hallelujah for the good days
Hallelujah for every breath we get
Hallelujah, amen

It's a Saturday night you never want to end
It's the broken heart you never got to mend
It's the words that you heard, that you can't un-hear again
It's the what you didn't know was the last goodbye
When you learn everything has a last time
The same mistakes that you made, you see in your little girl's eye

Hallelujah for the heartache
Hallelujah for the good days
Hallelujah for every breath we get
Hallelujah, amen

For the times we get
For the chance we don't
From the very first breath
'Til it's carved in stone

Hallelujah for the heartache
Hallelujah for the good days
Hallelujah for every breath we get
Hallelujah, amen

Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Hallelujah
Hallelujah for every breath we get
Hallelujah, amen
Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Amen (Hallelujah)
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Amen

4 ContributorsIt’s Your Call Lyrics
It's your call, it's her
Would you rather take it in the other room
She's hanging on and so am I
Yeah, I know all about it, don't act so surprised
It's time to end this game you're playing
She's not the only one who's waiting on the line

It's your call
It's up to you
And I won't try to stop you if you go
But if you stay tell her goodbye
I can't take another minute
I can't stand another night

Of wondering if I even matter
It's something only you can answer
Here's the phone, it's your call

There's no easy way out this time
Because I won't live this way
She called here to talk to you
With a message that I can't take

Oh I got to know if I still matter
It's something only you can answer
Here's the phone, it's your call

[Song 84: Can’t Even Get the Blues]
6 ContributorsCan’t Even Get the Blues Lyrics
I walk into the kitchen
The silverware is gone
The furniture is missing
I guess you got it all, uh-huh?
This is where it ought to hurt
Seems like every time you leave me
You try to think of something worse

I can't even get the blues no more
I try to worry like I did before
And nothing happens when I walk the floor
So what am I supposed to do
I toss and turn but then I fall asleep
I'm going under but it's not too deep
You want to hurt me but it's just no use
I can't even get the blues

Well, this time ain't no different
The sun's up in the sky
Sitting on the back porch
Clouds are rolling by
Oh this is where it ought to rain
But it doesn't really matter
To me, it's all about the same

I can't even get the blues no more
I try to worry like I did before
And nothing happens when I walk the floor
So what am I supposed to do
I toss and turn but then I fall asleep
I'm going under but it's not too deep
You try to hurt me but it's just no use
I can't even get the blues
I can't even get the blues no more
I try to worry like I did before
And nothing happens when I walk the floor
So what am I supposed to do
I toss and turn but then I fall asleep
I'm going under but it's not too deep
You want to hurt me but it's just no use
I can't even get the blues

[Song 85: Angels Singin’]
4 ContributorsAngels Singin’ LyricsWalkin' down some winding roads
Twistin' in some lone shadows
Hanglin' with that company, longer than I should
Drink with pain, and dance with fear
Still they always find me here
Troubles stacked up to the ceiling, that's when I hear my angels singin'
Singin' that heavenly song
They find me where they know I hurt
When both my knees hit the dirt
Strung out like some Christmas lights on a hellish day
They know when I'm down this low, I always remember how it goes
When my soul needs sweet redeeming, that's when I hear my angels singin'
That's when I hear my angels singin'
Singin'
Singin' that heavenly song
Right on time just when I need it
Singin' that heavenly song
First, a whisper
Then, a hum
Then, it's louder than a drum
It goes from shouting up to screaming
That's how I hear my angels singin'
The band of voices wrapped in light
Calling from the other side
When I'm dancing with my demons, that's when I hear my angels singin'

Oh, That's when I hear my angels singin'
Singin' that heavenly song
Oh, Right on time just when I need it
Singin' that heavenly song

First, a whisper
Then, a hum
Then, it's louder than a drum
It goes from shouting up to screaming
That's how I hear my angels singin'
That's how I hear my angels singin'
Singin' my heavenly song

[Song 86: Say A Prayer]
3 ContributorsSay A Prayer LyricsIt's on his face, it's in his eyes
All alone under a mission sign
It says, "Jesus saves"
It's in the tears of a broken home
It's all uphill when love is gone
And you're all out of faith
Well, listen can you hear Him?
Say a prayer for me when you're down
On your knees tonight (Remember me)
Say a prayer for me when you're down
On your knees
It's in the dirt on a farmer's hands
His blood and sweat are in that plant
Sure could use a little rain
Down every road in every town
All the lost, all the found
To Him, we're all the same
Oh, everybody needs one
Say a prayer for me when you're down
On your knees tonight (Remember me)
Oh, say a prayer for me when you're down
On your knees

And I will say one for you (I will say one for you)
And hope it helps see you through
Say a prayer for me when you're down
On your knees tonight (Remember me)
Oh, say a prayer for me when you're down
On your knees tonight (Remember me)
Oh, say a prayer, say a prayer
Remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me
When you're down on your knees
Say a prayer for me
Would you please, tonight?
Yes, Jesus loves me
The Bible tells me so

[Song 87: Somebody’s Chelsea]
4 ContributorsSomebody’s Chelsea Lyrics
Met an old man yesterday
Next to me on a westbound plane
He said, "I was married sixty years
I swear it feels like she's still here"
Then he took out a picture

Staring at that black and white
The tears filled up in his eyes
I said, "You were a lucky man"
He said, "I feel like I still am"
When he told me her name
I heard myself say

I want to be Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night
One and only girl
A part of a love story
That never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be:
Somebody's Chelsea

He made me laugh when he talked about
Their first date and her father's doubts
He said "Even as her hair turned gray
She still took my breath away"
And that it never changed with time
That's when I closed my eyes

I want to be somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night
One and only girl
A part of a love story
That never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be:
Somebody's Chelsea

And when we finally said goodbye
I hugged him and said, "I'll never forget
How you showed me what it means -"

To be somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night
One and only girl
A part of a love story
That never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be -
And I wanna be
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea

How blue (How blue) can you make me?
How long until I heal?
How can I go on loving you when you're gone?
How blue
(How blue) can I feel?

Oh, honey, why did you leave me?
Don't you have a heart left in your chest
I swear to you that I'm dying
Because my mind won't let my body rest

How blue (How blue) can you make me?
How long until I heal?
How can I go on loving you when you're gone?
How blue
(How blue) can I feel?

If I sink any lower
I'll go under
If I cry anymore
I'll go blind
No, there's no relief for this missing you grief
How long can you torture my mind?

How blue (How blue) can you make me?
How long until I heal?
How can I go on loving you when you're gone?
How blue

[Song 89: The Clown]
8 ContributorsThe Clown Lyrics
After a couple of bottle of red wine, the truth finally came out
The words "I don't love you anymore" spilled from his mouth
So I looked to the waiter for some consolation
But he just poured the coffee, and without hesitation
He said, "Ma'am, is that all you'll be needing tonight?"

And oh, the piano kept playing
And nobody noticed the heart in the corner booth breaking
Cell phones kept ringin', glasses were clinkin'
Everyone laughin' and dancin' and singin'
So I painted a smile on my face to cover the frown
In that room full of jokers and jesters, I was the clown

Well, you can't walk the high wire of love and be afraid to fall
And you can't put all of your faith in a gypsy's crystal ball
We just do what we do, take the chances we take
Show me a life without a mistake
Oh, we all learn our lessons and we all fall down

And oh, the piano keeps playing
And nobody notices the heart in the corner booth breaking
Cell phones keep ringin', glasses keep clinkin'
Everyone laughin' and dancin' and singin'
So if you paint a big smile on your face to cover the frown
In that room full of jokers and jesters, sometimes you're the clown

When the circus is over and the tents are pulled down
The truth is, the show must go on for the clown

And oh, the piano kept playing

[Song 90: I Want A Cowboy]
7 ContributorsI Want A Cowboy Lyrics
Everybody told me he was dream
Picture perfect, like he'd stepped right off the silver screen
Said that he would sweep me off of my feet
But I'm still standing here, no he didn't do it for me
Because I don't go for all that wine and dine
With that ray ban, fake tan, never mind
I want a down-home, up with the sun rise man
A pick-up truck driving, bull riding, strong steadied hand
I want the Wranglers, Stetson, and all that stuff
On all the cheap talkers, needing me, feeding me lines
Give me somebody who’s tender and tough
Simple and honest, knows a thing or two about love
I’ve seen enough to, you know, know what I Like
It’s the hard workin', head turnin' rugged type
Chorus:
I want a down-home, up with the sun rise man
A pick-up truck driving, bull riding, strong steadied hand
I want the Wranglers, Stetson, and all that stuff
I want the real McCoy, I want a cowboy
I’ve seen enough to know, you know what I mean;
Ride me off into the sunset, that’s my thang…

I Want the real McCoy, I want a cowboy
I'm tired of talking about it, and wasting my time

[Song 91: Promise Me Love]
4 ContributorsPromise Me Love Lyrics
So promise me something, right here and now
You'll never lose me in a sea of a faceless crowd
Scream it from mountains, love me out loud
In quiet whispers you'll remind me what you found

And I swear not to give up on you
I swear that I'll always be your truth
I swear to bring you light in the darkest nights

Come, we will always be loved
It's scary, it's freeing, it's twirling in meaning
It's hiding from all you can and can't see
Romance and love, romance and love

Two roads approaching, which way do we turn?
Doesn't much matter cause we've lived and let go and we've learned
Without the map, it's just you and me
Leading each other in a world that'll always believe
 + 

Promise me, promise me love

[Song 92: A Christmas Letter]
4 ContributorsA Christmas Letter Lyrics
At an antique desk
An old man sits alone
It's Christmas Eve
And it's almost time to go
He signs his name to a letter he just wrote
Then he reads it back with a voice as soft as snow

I want peace on earth for Christmas
In a world where there's not one hungry child
They would hope and faith
Conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love

Then he walks outside
And he climbs up on his sleigh
And calls out to his reindeer
Off they fly away
Oh tonight he'll make a million dreams appear
While he wishes that his own dreams would come true this year

I want peace on earth for Christmas
In a world where there's not one hungry child
They would hope and faith
Conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love

That they would hope and faith
Conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love

Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far, they'll all lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back

Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on cheap red wine

Fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
Still I can't let sorrow bring me way down

Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me, I will go on

Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone and make him mine
Me, I'll be just

Fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
Still I can't let sorrow bring me way down

I'll be fine and dandy

I'm barely getting through tomorrow
Still I can't let sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
Still I can't let sorrow bring me way down

I'll be fine

[Song 94: Happy Birthday Jesus (I’ll Open This One for You)]
5 ContributorsHappy Birthday Jesus (I’ll Open This One for You) Lyrics
Now, kids, hang on just a second before we start
You know, there's a reason we are all here in front of grandma and grandpa's Christmas tree
And if Trevor and E.P. would quit fighting long enough and be real quiet
This little song might help you understand

Long ago in a stable, there was a baby being born
His parents were Joseph and Mary and Joseph's big old heart was torn
'Cause he couldn't find a decent place for Mary to have her child
But Mary said it just seemed just right and she blessed it with her smile

'Cause what made it special was the baby in her arms
God sent Him down to give the world a second chance for you and I
That's why we have Christmas at this time each year
It's the baby's birthday party that brings us so much cheer

Now kids, the presents that all of you exchange on Christmas
Represents the gifts that baby Jesus received the night he was born
He got all his presents from three wise men
Who followed a star and walked a long, long way to the stable
So every time you tear open one of your presents, think about that baby and say
"Happy birthday, Jesus, I'll open this one for you"

'what made it special was the baby in her arms
God sent Him down to give the world a second chance for you and I
That's why we have Christmas at this time each year
It's the baby's birthday party that brings us so much cheer

Okay, all together now
"Happy birthday, Jesus, I'll open this one for you"

A love to last past Saturday night
And I'd like to know

I want a Sunday kind of love
And I want a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody
Someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love
I do all my Sunday dreaming
And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
And I'm hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way
And my arms needs someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
And I need a love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love, oh yeah
Yeah, I don't want a Monday or a Tuesday
A Wednesday or a Thursday
Friday or Saturday
I don't want nothing baby
But I want a Sunday kind of love

He wants to tell somebody
So he tells his teddy bear
I saw Mama kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peek (it says peep but go with peek)
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep
Then, I saw Mama tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mama kissing Santa Claus last night
I saw Mama kissing Santa Claus

How do you tell someone you're letting go
I wish that I could tell you
But you're asking me things that I don't know
I wish that I could tell you
The words that I would say
Sound as empty as the way you feel inside
While the silence in between
Tells me everything that you deny

I don't know how to help you
I wish that I could tell you
How to tell me goodbye

I don't know how you leave it all behind
I wish that I could tell you
Is it true a heart heals itself with time
I wish that I could tell you
How do you choose
Do you hurt them with the truth or with a lie
Where do you go to find the courage
You know I could never find


Where do you turn, where do you go
When you've finally reached the end of the road
How do you say it I just don't know
When it comes to leaving you're on your own

How do you tell someone you're letting go
I wish that I could tell you
I wish that I could tell you

When everything is right
But sometimes wonderful
Can fall apart sometimes
When your troubles knock you down
Pick yourself up off the ground and

Walk on
Nothing ever stays wrong that long
Walk on
Oh, walk on
Don't just stand there in the storm
Walk toward the light until you find the sun
And you'll be better off in the long run
And walk on

Oh, it's a heartache when love comes to an end
But even though your heart breaks
You know it's going to mend
Keep the faith right through goodbye
And don't you ever break your stride


Walk on

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost
But now I'm found

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost
But now I'm found
I was blind but now I see
I was blind, oh, but now I see

2 ContributorsShe Wasn’t Good Enough For Him Lyrics
She was good at late night listening
When he'd call her on the phone
She was good to come and get him
When he couldn't make it home
She was good to make love to
And they did now and then
She was good to never ask
When he'd be back again

She wasn't good enough for him
For his family or his friends
He kept her out there on a limb
Wouldn't let her go, wouldn't let her in
She wasn't good enough for him

She was there on his bad days
And for years he led her on
We all knew she had a bad case
He was doing her all wrong
She couldn't bring herself to do the right thing
Break it off and say goodbye
Until she overheard him one night telling
Somebody on the side that


She was good at late night listening
When he'd call her on the phone

Cuz I won't be there to hold your hand
Like I used to
I'm through with you
You're a hell of a singer and a powerful man
But you surround yourself with people who demand so little of you
You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singing along right with you
You said I need you
Then you changed the words and added harmony
And you sang the song you had written for to someone new
~Chorus~
Nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel that things are right when I know they're wrong
Nobody sings a love song quite like you
Sing your song sweet music man
You travel the world with your six-piece band
That does for you
What you ask them to
You try to stay young but the songs you've sung to so many people
They've all begun to come back on you

Sing your song sad music man
Your making your living doin one night stands
They're through with you
They don't need you
You're still a hell of a singer but a broken man
But you'll keep searching for that one last fan
To sing to
~Chorus~

Oh, my heart's doin' fine
It's just a state of mind it was goin' through
Ain't been beatin' out no sad songs
Or rhymin' to the rhythm of the blues
Been gettin' on the times
Of leaving in the past what I can't undo
So throw your hat back in the ring
And baby, I'll swing all night long with you

Since a cowboy made me smile the way you do
I've been fallin' for the same old lies
And dancin' to the same old tunes
If you don't mind movin' slow, I'll give it a go
Hey, what's there to lose?
Could be more than just a fling
So baby, I'll swing all night long with you

Let's let those doggone bygones be long gone
And we'll find a new song to two-step to
If you wanna take another swing at love
Baby, I'll swing all night long with you

And we'll find a new song to two-step to
If you wanna take another swing at love
Baby, I'll swing all night long with you
Yeah baby, I'll swing all night long with you

Let's let those doggone bygones be long gone
And we'll find a new song to two-step to
If you wanna take another swing at love
Baby, I'll swing all night long with you
Baby, I'll swing all night long with you, oh

Tear drops fell on mama's note
When I read the things she wrote
She said, we miss you girl
We love you come on home
Well, I didn't have to pack
I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

It's hard to tell the state I'm in
Where I'm going, where I've been
But there's a dream I've been following so long
If mama knew the things I've done
She'd forgive them everyone
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home


Can't remember when I ate, it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home


Lord, I'm still five hundred miles away from home

He said please come to Boston
For the springtime
I'm staying here with some friends
And they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafe where I hope to be working soon
Please come to Boston
I said no, boy would you come home to me

(And) I said, rambling boy
Why don't you settle down
Boston ain't your kind of town
There ai't no gold
And there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee

He said, please come to Denver
With the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains
So far we can't be found
And throw I love you echos
Down the canyons
And then lie awake at night
Until they come back around
Please come to Denver
I just said no boy won't you come home to me

(And) I said, rambling boy
Why don't you settle down
Denver ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold
And there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee

Now that drifter's world goes round and round
And I doubt if it's ever going to stop
But of all the dreams he's lost or found
And all that I ain't got
He's still needs to lean to
Somebody he can sing to

He said please come to L.A to live forever
A California life alone is just too hard to build
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky
Living up on the hill
Please come to L.A
I just said no
Boy, won't you come home to me

(And) I said, rambling boy
Why don't you settle down
LA can't be your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee

I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee

[Song 105: No U in Oklahoma]
4 ContributorsNo U in Oklahoma Lyrics
Well my daddy said the day he met you
We weren't meant to be
Said, "That boy’s got a wild streak in him"
That spelled trouble for me
My foolish heart had love to burn
You took it for a ride
Down a long road of twists and turns
Heartaches, hurt, and lies

You put the T for tears in Texas
S for sad in St. Louis
Our reckless travels led us
To the state of Missouri
I cried clear 'cross Carolina
'Bout some boy in Tennessee
There’s no U in Oklahoma
And that's okay with me

We tried K.C., Fort Worth, Reno
Cheyenne, Timbuktu
Somewhere down 'round Tupelo
My daddy's words rang true
I called it quits in T-Town
I finally had my say
Adiós, see you around
I'm gone, you go your way

You put the T for tears in Texas
S for sad in St. Louis
Our reckless travels led us
To the state of Missouri
I cried clear 'cross Carolina
'Bout some boy in Tennessee
There's no U in Oklahoma
And that’s okay with me

You put the T for tears in Texas
S for sad in St. Louis
Our reckless travels led us
To the state of Missouri
I cried clear ’cross Carolina
'Bout some boy in Tennessee
There’s no U in Oklahoma
And that's okay with me
Oh, there's no U in Oklahoma
And that's okay with me

6 Contributors(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven LyricsYou Lift Me Up to Heaven peaked at #8 on Billboard’s Hot Country Singles chart in 1980.
I've been to Colorado, where the mountains touch the sky
And I've done other things in life to lift my spirits high
But nothing that I've ever tried to do
Has taken me as high as loving you

'Cause you lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
When you gently lay me down
You lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
Yes you make my world go round

I never try to get away on daydreams anymore
Love's taken me to places that I've never been before
But if it's not heaven when you're holding me
It's the way that heaven oughta be

'Cause you lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
When you gently lay me down
You lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
Yes you make my world go round

And we never leave the ground
Up, up, up, up to heaven
Yes, you make my world go round

[Song 107: What If]
4 ContributorsWhat If LyricsSometimes I don't understand
Feels like I'm living in a world gone mad
Look around, all around it's just the same
People just rush everywhere
No time to ever take the time to care
We're the ones
We're the losers in this game
So where is the tenderness we scarifice for progress
And where is the love we need
You know it makes me wonder
What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice (sang with just one voice)
Maybe we could change things
What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things somehow
Somehow it's all up to us
Gotta take this world, make it a world of love
Gotta do it now
Gotta find a way to make a change somehow
There's gotta be a way for us to make it better
What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice (sang with just one voice)
Maybe we could change things
What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things somehow

Here in our hearts
Oh the answer is there
If we only would look inside them
We can make it better, we can make it better... If we try together
What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice (sang with just one voice)
Maybe we could change things
What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things somehow

Preacher man talking about the end of time
Well, Lord knows I'm ready, it doesn't worry my mind
You see, I am not afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of angels watching over me

You can take my possessions

Nobody but Jesus is going to take my soul

Walk through darkness
I don't need no light
My faith in Jesus going to be my guide
You see, I am not afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of of angels watching over me


River's rising but I got no doubt
My sweet Savior's going to pull me out
You see, I'm not afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of angels watching over me


I am not afraid of anything because I believe
I've got a sky full of angels watching over me

[Song 109: In His Mind]
4 ContributorsIn His Mind Lyrics
He's got their picture on the mantle
The one they took in Destin, 1995
He's got water in the kettle
Her favorite cup already just the way she likes
And he'll leave the front porch light on
Like he does every night

In his mind, she'll be home any day now
He can't see her leaving him behind
In his mind, she'll find her way back somehow
Some things never change, she's never far away
In his mind

There's a picture on page seven
A happy couple smiling on their wedding day
His kids don't have the heart to tell him
And if they did, it wouldn't matter anyway
He swore to her he'd wait forever
He don't care how long it takes

In his mind, she'll be home any day now
He can't see her leaving him behind
In his mind, she'll find her way back somehow
Some things never change, she's never far away
In his mind

In his mind, she'll be home any day now
He can't see her leaving him behind
In his mind, she'll find her way back somehow
He won't turn off the light, she'll keep on burning bright
In his mind
Oh, in his mind
Oh, in his mind

4 ContributorsWhy Not Tonight Lyrics
Well, pardon me, but you have my attention
Ever since you strolled into the room
Believe me that it's not my intention
If I appear to come on too smooth
It's not like me to make such advances
But this time baby I could not resist
So if you're up for taking a chance on love
I can't see a better time than this

So baby, why not tonight?
This could be the start of something right
Hey, we can take it easy
We can take it so slow
We can take it anywhere that you'd like to go

So baby, why not tonight
The stars are out and I'm sure they'll agree
Oh, it's a perfect night for falling in love
So why not fall in love with me?

Oh, maybe we could go out for some dinner
And later on how we could do the town
You know I consider myself a winner
Just to have a boy like you around
Then if you're up for doing some dancing
Yeah I know a place they dance until the dawn
Anything you like will be alright
So why not take a chance and come along?

So baby, why not tonight?
This could be the start of something right
Hey, we can take it easy
We can take it so slow
We can take it anywhere that you'd like to go

So baby, why not tonight
The stars are out and I'm sure they'll agree
Oh, it's a perfect night for falling in love
So why not fall in love with me?

You sure know what you're doing
Holding me this way
And I'll go where you lead me
Anywhere you say
You've got me where you want me
So darling, please be kind
Before you take it all
And I make that final fall
You've got to keep in mind

I'm a new fool at an old game
A kid out of school trying to find my way
But I don't know the rules, teach me how to play
I'm just a new fool at an old game

Well, maybe I'm a dreamer
Or maybe I'm naive
But when you say you love me
I start to believe
That coal can turn to diamonds
And this night will never end
But if it isn't so and I cry when you go
You've got to understand

I'm a new fool at an old game
A kid out of school trying to find my way
But I don't know the rules, teach me how to play
I'm just a new fool at an old game

[Song 112: She Can’t Save Him]
4 ContributorsShe Can’t Save Him Lyrics
She can hear his car, as it pulls in the drive
She can whisper a prayer, "Thank God, he's alive"
She can meet him at the door, catch him when he falls
She can even believe that it isn't his fault

But she can't save him

She can make his coffee, in the cold light of day
She can make his excuses, tell the boss he'll be late
She can wave at the neighbors, then kiss him goodbye
And not say a word about what happened last night


Sometimes she dreams that he's caught in a stream
And the water keeps pulling him down
She reaches for him, as he pulls her in
She wakes just before she drowns
She can remember the man that he was
And still shed a tear for what he's become
She can live in that house until the day
She sees that it's only herself she can save


And that day she'll know she hasn't failed
Because nothing can change until he saves himself

5 ContributorsBreak Each Other’s Hearts Again Lyrics
Do you still drink whiskey?
Can I buy you a round?
If nobody's sitting here, do you mind if I sit down?
I was nervous when I saw you
I almost walked away
And now I can't believe what I'm about to say

These arms want to hold you
These lips want to kiss you
These eyes are glad to see you
Well baby I miss you
Let's drive each other crazy
Like we did back then
Why don't we get together
And break each other's hearts again?

Maybe I've had one too many
I don't want to say too much
We both know the reasons
Why we didn't keep in touch
We're no good for each other
Still it's hard to let it go
I'm trying to be strong
But babe you've got to know

These arms want to hold you
These lips want to kiss you
These eyes are glad to see you
Well baby I miss you
Let's drive each other crazy
Like we did back then
Why don't we get together
And break each other's hearts again?

Loving you should be the last thing on my mind
It feels so good to let you hurt me one more time

These arms want to hold you
These lips want to kiss you
These eyes are glad to see you
Well baby I miss you
Let's drive each other crazy
Like we did back then
Why don't we get together
And break each other's hearts again?

That your baby boy has come to make you new?
This child that youve delivered
Will soon deliver you
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Did you know
That your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss your little baby
Youve kissed the face of god
Mary, did you know?
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy is lord of all creation?
Did you know
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy is heavens perfect lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding
Is the great I am

3 ContributorsYou’re the One I Dream About Lyrics
I caught you smiling at me again out of the corner of my eye
It isn't easy when I have to pretend that you're just another guy
I can't let anyone ever know
I can't let my feelings show

Because you're the one I dream about when I fall asleep at night
And you're the one I think about when he turns out the light
Now it's so hard to live without you're love to hold me tight
How I wish that he was you tonight

Whenever you are close to me my heart just won't be still
I hope that no one else can see the way you make me feel
If only I didn't have to hide all this loving I hold inside

Because you're the one I dream about when I fall asleep at night
And you're the one I think about when he turns out the light
Now it's so hard to live without you're love to hold me tight
How I wish that he was you tonight

If we could somehow be together
I know this love of ours would last forever

Because you're the one I dream about when I fall asleep at night
And you're the one I think about when he turns out the light
Now it's so hard to live without you're love to hold me tight
How I wish that he was you tonight

Puttin' on my blue jeans, lipstick in my holster
Kickin' your memory's gonna be easy
You can't stop me, no sir, no way
I'll be the one who got away
Ain't it a beautiful day?

Walkin' with my head high, soakin' up the sunshine
La la-la la la life is sweet
I don't really need him, I got wheels of freedom
And that's why goodbye looks so good on me

Goodbye looks good on me, goodbye looks good on me

Goin' out with all of my girlfriends
Heads'll be turnin'
Gettin' right back in the saddle
Heart'll be open, guns'll be smokin'
Boy, you could not handle all of this
I'll be the one you're gonna miss

Walkin' with my head high, soakin' up the sunshine
La la-la la la life is sweet
I don't really need him, I got wheels of freedom
And that's why goodbye looks so good on me

Goodbye looks good on me, goodbye looks good on me
Goodbye looks good on me, goodbye looks good on me

And I could not thank you enough
For leaving me in the dust
No sir, no way
I'll be the one who got away

Walkin' with my head high, soakin' up the sunshine
La la-la la la life is sweet
I don't really need him, I got wheels of freedom
And that's why goodbye looks so good on me

Goodbye looks good on me, goodbye looks good on me
Goodbye looks good on me, goodbye looks good on me
Goodbye looks good on me, goodbye looks good on me
Goodbye looks good on me, goodbye looks good on me

LA's a fast horse daddy
Everybody rides
I'm sorry I haven't called home lately
Out here time flies
I met a boy a few weeks back
He plays in a band
He's a whole lot like you daddy you're going to like him
He's a good man
At times lonely sneaks up on me
But I'm getting by
Yeah I know what you've always told me
Cow girls don't cry

But does the wind still blow in Oklahoma
Out here the Hollywood stars sure shine bright
It's such a long way from home here in California
Missing you and that blue wide open sky

Out here it's all freeway fast cars
Cold concrete
You won't believe all the crazy people
Bally girls sun sets free
I met a girl you're going to like her mama
She has your hair
Red as the telecross sunset
Seems like an angel I swear
I can't say I don't get lonesome
But I'm alright
Cow boys kind of go with homesick
Like blue moons and whipperwill nights

When our check bounces at the store
And the whole world seems at war
You bring me peace of mind once more
With just a little love
When the boss says I'm ten minutes late
And the stack of bills just won't wait
Ooh, you take the worries away
With just a little love

Just a little love
And affection
You bring a touch of perfection
To a world that's sometimes crazy
And so mixed up

Just a little love
You have changed me
You make me see why the good Lord made me
And you can do miracles
With just a little love

When our old car won't run
And all my dreams come undone
You'll make it right won't you, hun
With just a little love
When it seems like all the truths are gone
When I'm trying so hard to hold on
You make it easy to be strong
With just a little love

Just a little love
And affection
You bring a touch of perfection
To a world that's sometimes crazy
And so mixed up

Just a little love
You have changed me
You make me see why the good Lord made me
And you can do miracles
With just a little love

When the ground beneath you starts a shaking
Shaking
And you forget the place we came from
Came from
When your lost and looking for a way home
Your way home to me
I'll come out and find you
When the world around you starts a moving
Moving
And you should wonder if I still love you
Love you
If you feel a darkness coming
Rising inside
I'll make a light to guide you back home

And after all the sky is falling down
And after all the waters washed away
My love's the only promise that remains

When your doubts have got you thinking
Thinking
Nothings ever really sacred
Sacred
And you're afraid you might believe it
Believe in me
And I'll give you a region
Because the world around us keeps on moving
Moving
And there's no doubt that
I still love you
Love you
So when you feel a darkness coming
Rising inside
I'll make a light to guide you back home

Another morning, another day in your life
Without someone there by you
You had a dream again last night
You wonder why the dream just won't come true

So what are you going to do?
Walk around with your head hung down?
Maybe that's the reason you've never found the one for you
So you've got to let your love shine through your eyes, your smile
You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside your heart
You'll find, somebody wants to be a part of your life
And if you just believe and say that's what you're going to do
One day, love will find its way to you
Yes, it will
One day, love will find its way to you

Another party, and all your friends are smiles
Oh, you might meet someone new
And being close would be so nice
In this life the chances are so few

So what are you going to do?
Walk around with your head hung down?
Maybe that's the reason you've never found the one for you
So you've got to let your love shine through your eyes, your smile
You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside your heart
You'll find, somebody wants to be a part of your life
And if you just believe and say that's what you're going to do
One day, love will find its way to you
Yes, it will
One day, love will find its way to you

Don't you ever think you're the only one
Oh, somewhere in the world there's a lonely heart looking for someone
You've got to let your love shine through you eyes, your smile
You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside
You'll find, somebody wants to be a part of your life
Because your eyes, your smile
You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside
Somebody wants to be a part of your life

When he leaves me he wears a smile now
As soon as he's away from me
In your arms is where he wants to be
But you're the one he rushes home to
You're the one he gave his name to
I never see his face in the early morning light
You have his mornings, his daytimes
And sometimes I have his nights
But does he love you? (does hе love you?)
Like he lovеs me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you? (does he think of you?)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies?
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?
But when he's with me, he says he needs me
And that he wants me, that he believes in me
And when I'm in his arms, oh he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me, or am I deceiving myself?'
Oh does he love you? (does he love you?)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you? (does he think of you?)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies?
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?

Oh, shouldn’t I lose my temper?
Oh, and shouldn’t I be ashamed?
Cause I have everything to lose
And I, I have nothing to gain
But does he love you? (does he love you?)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you? (does he think of you?)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies?
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?
Does he?
Oh does he love you?

You want to know what I could be thinking
But as I speak the music starts to play
And the words just somehow slip away

Read my mind
It will tell you that I love you and
You're all I ever wanted in a man
You'd see how I feel
What my head won't let my heart reveal
If only you could read my mind, read my mind

One look from you and one look at me
I'm trembling like a little girl
I tell myself if I can just believe
Any day now you'll fall in love with me


Tell me if you feel the same way I do
And tell me that I'm not mistakenly taken with you

You're all I ever wanted in a man
You see, all I need is everything you are to me
If you could somehow read my mind
You would see what I can't seem to say
If only you could, if you would read my mind
Read my mind

6 ContributorsStarting Over Again Lyrics
Mama moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way

And all the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put mama and daddy back together again

Starting over again
Where should they begin?
'Cause they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown?
And the whole world cries

He got an apartment, she moved in with her sisters
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home, sorting out pieces
Of left over memories from thirty-odd years

Starting over again
Where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own?
Starting over again (Over again)
Never any end

What will the neighbors say?
They're talking talk, it's small town news
They're facing fifty years old
Wrecking up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools

Starting over again
Oh, where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own?
Starting over again
Oh, never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown

And all the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put mama and daddy back together

[Song 125: The Bar’s Getting Lower]
4 ContributorsThe Bar’s Getting Lower Lyrics
Her mama always told her to hold out for a good man
Sounded like a good plan all those years ago
A little house with a picket fence
Simple life with a couple kids
But tonight she's just looking for a shoulder

She was hoping for pink champagne
But she'll settle for well whiskey
Saw herself in a long white gown
Not downtown gettin' tipsy
And that one-night stand walking through the door
Ain't the marrying kind, yeah that's for sure
But she's gettin' older
And the bar's gettin' lower

Her dreams are disappearing like smoke from his cigarette
She hasn't said "Yes," but she's thinking she might
The closer it gets to closing time
A lonely heart will take a pick-up line
Anything to get her through the night

'Cause she was hoping for pink champagne
But she'll settle for well whiskey
Saw herself in a long white gown
Not downtown gettin' tipsy
And that drunk cowboy tellin' her lies
Ain't the John Wayne she had in mind
But she's gettin' older
And the bar's gettin' lower

She could thank you for the drink and walk away
Live to love another day
But she's gettin' older
And the night's gettin' colder
And the bar's gettin' lower
The bar's gettin' lower

The way the snow is fallin'; it's all a bit familiar
I feel alive again here in the dead of winter
Takes me back to what we had

The crackle of the fire re-lit those burnin' embers
The warmth in every touch is just how I remember
Almost like no time's gone by

I swear those string lights are shinin' brighter this year
It's like that mistletoe is hangin' low, whisperin' in my ear
Puttin' thoughts in my head and love in my heart
Like we're right back at the start
I needed Christmas to find my way back here to you

The carols in the air have never sounded better
A winter wonderland is bringing us together
That angel on the tree must be lookin' out for you and me

I swear those string lights are shinin' brighter this year
It's like that mistletoe is hangin' low, whisperin' in my ear
Puttin' thoughts in my head and love in my heart
Like we're right back at the start
I needed Christmas to find my way back here

To you and me
I never thought it'd happen
But now I believe
In a little Christmas magic

I swear those string lights are shinin' brighter this year
It's like that mistletoe is hangin' low, whisperin' in my ear
Puttin' thoughts in my head and love in my heart
Like we're right back at the start
And I needed Christmas to find my way back here to you
Oh, I needed Christmas to find my way

Cause you wanted me to live life without you in it
But I forgave you
Oh I hope you know it's true
And I don't blame you
For not feeling like I do
I'm pretty sure it's not the end of the world tonight
Even though down deep in my soul it feels like it might
I'm pretty sure I'll wake up tomorrow still breaking inside
And I'll go on missing you, I'll go on wanting you
I'll go on with or without you, I'll go on
I'll carry what's left of us with me always
Remember last summer, those were the good days
I wouldn't trade them, not to hurt now
If I could've told myself not to love you somehow
I'd still love you, I hope you know it's true
But letting go of you is so much harder to do
I'm pretty sure it's not the end of the world tonight
Even though down deep in my soul it feels like it might
I'm pretty sure I'll wake up tomorrow still breaking inside
And I'll go on missing you, I'll go on loving you
I'll go on with or without you, I'll go on

I'll go on
So, go on, go on

[Song 128: Softly and Tenderly]
6 ContributorsSoftly and Tenderly Lyrics
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See, on the portals, He's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me

Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, 'O sinner, come home

O for the wonderful love he has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me

Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, 'O sinner, come home!'

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See, on the portals, He's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me

Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, 'O sinner, come home!'
Calling, 'O sinner, come home!'
Come home!

[Song 129: That’s When I Knew]
5 ContributorsThat’s When I Knew Lyrics
It wasn't when you walked out, wasn't when you said goodbye
It wasn't when I sat down and had myself a real good cry
It wasn't when I tore your picture from the flame
Threw it in the fire and sent it up in flames
I still felt the same

But then tonight, I met someone
We went out, and we had fun
He made me laugh, we danced all night
And I didn't see your face when I was lookin' in his eyes
That's when I knew
I was over you

I was staying busy, tryna keep you off my mind
Baby but your memory, it put up a real good fight
Oh I went out with friends to have a drink or two
They tried to cheer me up, there was nothin' they could do
I was missin' you

But then tonight, there with him
If felt so good to feel good again
He took my hand and I did my line
And I didn't try to stop him when he kissed me goodnight
That's when I knew

I was over crying in my pillow, praying that you'd come home
Waiting for the phone to ring
Wondering where it went wrong, wishing I could move on
So I'd never feel this way
I thought I'd never see this day

[Song 130: Good Friends]
3 ContributorsGood Friends LyricsFeeling one another's joy and sorrow
Dreams today may come true tomorrow
Good friends
Close together like they're bookends
Feeling what the other one is feeling
They never seem to be without
Those little things to laugh about
Good friends
They have the kind of love
That only deepens
It's something that you rarely find worth keeping
Oh people even new ones come
You're lucky if you find just one good friend
And we say goodbye
Knowing what we have will fade away
We'll meet another time
Another day
My friend
Good friends
Their paths may never come together again
But in their hearts
They're on a road with no end
Where life will take us who can tell
Guess it's time to say farewell
My friend

Good friends
You never will forget
Your good friends

[Song 132: I’m Not That Lonely Yet]
8 ContributorsI’m Not That Lonely Yet Lyrics
I don't mind to give you a slow dance or two
I'm sorry I'm not at my best
I know you can see I'm incredibly blue
But I'm not that lonely yet

I look in your eyes while you're dancing with me
And try to fulfill your request
But don't ask for favors when it's time to leave
'Cause I'm not that lonely yet

Now don't say you want me
I've heard that before
The words weigh like stones in my head
There may come a time when I'll think of it more
But I'm not that lonely yet

It's nice to be dancing to waltzes again
And maybe it helps to forget
You've opened the door but I'm not waltzing in
'Cause I'm not that lonely yet
No, I'm not that lonely yet

[Song 133: Don’t Touch Me There]
4 ContributorsDon’t Touch Me There LyricsThese hands
You can hold them all night if you want to
And these lips
Won't mind your kisses
No, they don't care
You can lay your head on my shoulder
Maybe even get a little bolder
But when it comes to my heart
Oh, don't touch me there
Oh, these arms
You can wrap around me gently
And your fingers
You can run them through my hair
But there's one place that's off bounds
From the last time love came around
When it comes to my heart
Don't touch me there
Last time I gave my heart so sweetly, it broke
He broke it so completely
And even now it's more then I can bear
Now someday I know I'll try again someday
But until then
When it comes to my heart
Don't touch me there

These hands
You can hold them all night if you want to
And these lips
Won't mind your kisses
No, they don't care
You can lay your head on my shoulder
Maybe even get a little bolder
But when it comes to my heart
Oh, don't touch me there
Oh, but when it comes to my heart
Don't touch me there

[Song 134: When You Have A Child]
4 ContributorsWhen You Have A Child Lyrics
When you have a child
You learn it's a serious business
To have a little fun
You give grace and get forgiveness
Not seven times seven
But seven times seventy one
And when you have a child
Those four walls you call a house
Take on a life of it's own
When you bring them home
You will cry and you will laugh
When they hurt it cuts you in half
It's your flesh and bone

And year after year
Pictures fill page after page
They never really grow up
Still your baby at any age
The first time you hold them
It's like you see God's smile
What a smile
When you have a child

And then boy meets girl
And perfume and gasoline
Reign on your perfect world
Curfews are often broken
Thank yous aren't spoken
He's got the keys to that old Dodge
And she's wearing a corsage
And her mama's pearls


You pray that phone call never comes
And if God forbid
How would you live
How could you go on
And on and on and on

And year after year
Close the chapter and turn the page
Blue ribbons and losing seasons
Flipping tassles on the stage
Oh but you don't need a photograph
You've got at least a million
Pictures of that smile
When you close your eyes
When you love a child
Oh, when you love a child

[Song 135: All The Women I Am]
5 ContributorsAll The Women I Am Lyrics
Mhm, Mhm, Oh, Yeah

Well I can summon up my courage
Take on the whole world
Turn around and break down just like a little girl
And I come out swinging when my back's against the wall
And my mama always told me, better walk before you crawl
I need a man who can love all the women I am
I'm a mother of lost causes
A sister of the road
I give my heart to a song, but I never sell my soul
I'm good at keeping it together when the edges start to fray
When I'm sewing up the loose ends of everyday
I need a man who can love all the women I am

Sometimes I'm hard to handle
Burn hotter than a candle, but I melt in the right hands
Boy you love without condition
It isn't always easy living with all the women I am

I'm a daughter of the red dirt, Okie dust still in my bones
But I can light up New York City with my red hair and rhinestones
I'll still be my Mama's baby when my babies fly away
My moods change like the weather, but my faith it stays the same
I need a man who can stand all the women I am
I need a man who can love all the women I am


Hey I'm a realist
I'm a dreamer
I'm a silver lining seeker
I'm a devil or an angel who come running when you need her

Because I need a man who can love all the women I am
Oh I want a man who can love all the women I am
Hey you're a man who can love all the women I am
You're the man I needed all along
You can handle me baby
All the women I am
Yeah, you're the man
All the women I am

[Song 136: Sleeping With The Telephone]
4 ContributorsSleeping With The Telephone LyricsI knew who he was
When I took his name
But some how no one
Is just not the same at night
He knows the danger
But he does what he does
He calls it duty but I call it love
So here I am while he's gone
To some foreign land
And I cry because I'm alone
And the nights get so cold and long
And I try not to think he won't come home
But I'm sleeping with the telephone
The yellow ribbon on my neighbor's gate
Always reminds me that someone's awake
Just like me
I hear the sirens and I watch the news
He laughs and leaves with his gun
And his blue uniform
And I pray God keeps him safe from harm
And I cry because I'm alone
And the nights get so cold and long
And I try not to think he won't come home
But I'm sleeping with the telephone

I loose him in my darkest dreams
And my blood runs cold and my heart skips a beat
So I get up, I can't take anymore
Sometimes I hate how much I love him
But everyday, I love him more
And I try not to think he won't come home
But I'm sleeping with the telephone
Something wakes me from where he should be
I reach for him, the telephone rings

[Song 137: Talking In Your Sleep]
5 ContributorsTalking In Your Sleep Lyrics
Three o'clock in the morning
And it looks like it's going to be another sleepless night
I've been listening to your dreams and getting very low
Wondering what I can do

Maybe I'm being foolish
Because I haven't heard you mention anybody's name at all
How I wish I could be sure it's me that turns you on
Each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie

You've been talking in you sleep
Sleeping in your dreams, with some sweet lover
Holding on so tight loving her the way
You used to love me
Talking in your sleep
With loving on your mind

[Song 138: There Is A God]
4 ContributorsThere Is A God Lyrics
Try and put your arms around a hundred-year-old tree
Climb up on a horse and let him run full speed
Take a look down at the world from thirty thousand feet
On your next flight

Watch a flock of birds against a mornin' sun
Close your eyes and listen to the river run
Catch a firefly in your hand or a raindrop on your tongue
That's right

There is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much proof do you need?

Plant a seed and see what comes out of the ground
Find the heartbeat on your baby's ultrasound
In a few years, hear 'em laughin'
Don't it sound like a song?

Stop and think about what you don't understand
Things like life and love and how the world began
You're about to say we can't explain it
But the cancer's gone

Oh, there is a God
There is a God
There is a God
How much more proof do you need?

Science says it's just all circumstance
Like this whole world's just an accident
But if you wanna shoot that theory down
Look around (Just look around)
Oh, just look around

There is a God
How much proof do you need?
Oh, there is a God
Oh, there is a God (Is a God)
There is a God
How much more proof do you need?

How much proof do you need?
Ooh yeah
There is a God

[Song 139: I’m Gonna Take That Mountain]
4 ContributorsI’m Gonna Take That Mountain Lyrics
I'm going to take that mountain

I was born a stubborn soul
I'm not afraid of the great unknown
Or a winding road that's all uphill
This is just a stumbling block
Intimidating wall of rock
If you think this broken heart will break my will

I'm going to take that mountain
There's nothing going to slow me down
And there is no way around it
Going to leave it level with the ground
I'm not just going to cross it, climb it, fight it
I'm going to take that mountain

It's overwhelming looking up
I know when it's the challenge of
Me against this heartache to survive
I may slip and I may fall
But even if I have to crawl
I'll break through to the healing side


I'm not just going to cross it, climb it, fight it


I was born a stubborn soul
This is a stumbling block
I'm going to take that mountain

5 ContributorsClimb That Mountain High Lyrics
Red sun rising, over the hill
I've had enough of this desert to last from now until
I'm tired of living day-to-day and hand-to-mouth
This could be the day I finally find my way out

I'm going to climb that mountain high
I'm going to see what's on the other side
I'm going to kiss this town good-bye
I'm going to climb that mountain

How I arrived here, heaven only knows
Seems more like the kind of place the devil would've chose
To spend my life here, is more than I can do
I know somewhere down the road my dream will come true


If I stay here forever
What will I have to show
But if I make it over
Then everyone will know

I'm going to climb that mountain high

6 ContributorsYour Heart Lyrics
You can give a man the eye
When you walk in the road
Go on, give him your sweet smile
Let him smell your perfume

Give him your number, whisper your name
But hold on to just one thing

Don't give him your heart
Keep it hidden from the very start
If you don't give him your heart
When his love is gone, it won't break all apart
Your heart

When he reaches out his hand
Give him a chance
Let him pull you in so close
Don't be afraid to take that dance

Oh, tell him you want him, give him a rush
But don't give him too much

Don't give him your heart
Keep it hidden from the very start
If you don't give him your heart
When his love is gone, it won't break all apart
Your heart


Oh, give him your number and whisper your name
But don't give him everything

Don't give him your heart
Keep it hidden from the very start
If you don't give him your heart
When his love is gone, it won't break all apart
Hold on to your heart

[Song 144: On This Day]
4 ContributorsOn This Day Lyrics
The kids were up before dawn this morning
Right to the Christmas tree they ran
Called up the stairs for us to hurry
Wait for this day for about as long as they could stand

While trading presents the little one asks me
"Why do we have Christmas each year?"
I said, "Long ago, a child was born this day
He's a gift more precious than all you see here."

'Cause on this day
A child was born
In the town of Bethlehem
And on this day
God sent his son to bring peace and goodwill
To all men
Oh on this day we call Christmas
We honor his name
On this day
We recall all the reasons he came
On this day
On this day

Grandma and Grandpa arrived after breakfast
The rest of the gang by noon
We spent the day watching football and breaking in toys
Helping out in the kitchen
Catching up on old news

When the dinner bell rang
We all took our places
Grandpa said who wants to say grace
Before anyone else could utter a word
Oh the little one bowed her head
And she started to say

'Cause on this day
A child was born
In the town of Bethlehem
And on this day
God sent his son to bring peace and goodwill
To all men
Oh, on this day we call Christmas
We honor his name
On this day
We recall all the reasons he came
On this day
On this day

Oh, on this day we call Christmas
We honor his name
On this day
We recall all the reasons he came
On this day
On this day

In the beginning
The nights were long
Under the moonlight
I could do no wrong
You told me
I was everything you wanted me to be

Then summer was over
And the nights grew cold
You got restless
And hard to hold
I tried to be
Everything you wanted me to be
Now you keep staring
At that open door
You got what you wanted
And you still want more
Well look at me
I'm everything you wanted me to be

If I don't keep you satisfied
You can't say that I haven't tried
And if I'm not what you want by now
For the life of me I can't see how
I'll ever be
Everything that you want me to be

In the beginning
The nights were long
Under the moonlight
I could do no wrong
Remember me
I’m everything you wanted me to be

If I don't keep you satisfied
You can't say that I haven't tried
And if I'm not what you want by now
For the life of me I can't see how
I'll ever be
Everything that you want me to be

I'll ever be
Everything that you want me to be

You take the records, I'll take the stereo
You get the TV, and I'll take the radio
I'll keep the dishes, and you the pots and pans
You'll need a new car more than me, so I'll take the second hand
We'll each keep our own friends, divide the rest in two
The only kids seem to understand, still there's one thing left to do
It's over in the corner, our little one sits and cries
And behind that swell of tears she's asking with her eyes

What are you going to do about me?
What are you going to do about me?
Is it daddy on the weekend, mama rest of the week?
Will I have to make new friends? Live on a different street?
Who's going to be the one who tucks me into sleep?
Oh, what are you going to do, what are you going to do about me?

I gave her a hug, she pushed me away
I said in time you'll understand, and maybe we both will someday
I wiped her tears, and said, "It won't be so bad"
She said, "Will you still be my mommy, will he still be my dad?"

What are you going to do about me?
What are you going to do about me?
Is it daddy on the weekend, mama rest of the week?
Will I have to make new friends? Live on a different street?
Who's going to be the one who tucks me into sleep?
Oh, what are you going to do, what are you going to do about me?

How can I tell her when I don't know for sure?
Why her mom and dad don't love each other anymore?

I'm trying my best to give enough
To keep this love alive
It wouldn't be so hard for me to do
If it hadn't have been for all my heart's been through
But once you've learned to be lonely
And lonely is the only thing you've known
It begins to feel like home
It becomes your comfort zone
Once you've learned to be without someone
And settle for the silence of an empty room
Oh, it changes you
There's a lot you have to undo
Once you've learned to be lonely
It becomes a habit of the heart
To be afraid to even start
To try and love again
I want to give myself to you
But I've been alone so long that I'm scared
Scared to move
But once you've learned to be lonely
And lonely is the only thing you've known
It begins to feel like home
It becomes your comfort zone
Once you've learned to be without someone
And settle for the silence of an empty room
Oh, it changes you
There's a lot you have to undo
Once you've learned to be lonely

I've built there walls but I feel them falling down
Touch by touch your love is my way out
But once you've learned to be lonely
And lonely is the only thing you've known
It begins to feel like home
It becomes your comfort zone

And settle for the silence of an empty room
Oh, it changes you
