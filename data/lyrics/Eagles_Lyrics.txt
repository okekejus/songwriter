[Song 1: Hotel California]

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here"

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969"
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis"

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
"We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave"

Well, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose, and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy


Well, I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Oh, we got it easy
We oughta take it easy

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You've been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one, but I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get

Desperado, woah, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh, freedom, well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes
Away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you (Let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you before it's too late

One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out, pretty mama
What turns on your lights

The full moon is calling, the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons and you got desires
Well, I got a few of my own

Ooh, someone to be kind to
In between the dark and the light
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams, now
We're gonna find one
Mmm, one that really screams

I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her, but she's nowhere in sight

Ooh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right (oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights


(One of these nights)
Mmm, in between the dark and the light
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get you, baby, one of these nights
(One of these nights)
Hoo, hoo-hoo
Hoo, hoo-hoo
(One of these nights)
I can feel you
I can feel
(One of these nights)
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you, now
(One of these nights)
And it gets so dark
So dark and cold and lonely
One of these nights
One of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
(One of these nights)
Swear I'm gonna find you
Comin' right behind you, now
(One of these nights)
Hoo, hoohoooo
(One of these nights)
And I wanna say, ahhh
(One of these nights)
Ahh, one of these, one of these
(One of these nights)
Ahh, comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you

One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights

City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night, a big, old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

On the other side of town, a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night, anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that, soon, she'll be comin' back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired, or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things?
You're still the same old girl you used to be

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes

He was a hard-headed man, he was brutally handsome
And she was terminally pretty
She held him up and he held her for ransom
In the heart of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, "Faster, faster, the lights are turnin' red"

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, huh

Are you with me so far?

Eager for action, hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, huh
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh


Blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worst
She said, "Listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring"
"We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddamn thing"
He said, "Call the doctor, I think I'm gonna crash"
"The doctor say he's comin', but you gotta pay in cash"
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around and got lost
They didn't care, they were just dyin' to get off and it was

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh

Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane

It's another tequila sunrise
Starin' slowly 'cross the sky
I said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by

Every night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' 'round

She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
Woah, and it's a hollow feelin'
When it comes down to dealin' friends
It never ends
​

Take another shot of courage
Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb
It's another tequila sunrise
This old world still looks the same
Another frame

[Song 8: The Last Resort]
48 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolThe Last Resort Lyrics
She came from Providence
One in Rhode Island
Where the old world shadows hang
Heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams
Like a refugee
Just as her father came
Across the sea

She heard about a place
People were smiling
They spoke about the red man's ways
And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide

Down in the crowded bars
Out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all
What it's like up there
And they called it paradise
I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low
While the town got high

And then the chilly winds blew down
Across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast
To the Malibu
Where the pretty people play
Hungry for power
To light their neon way
And give them things to do

Some rich men came and raped the land
Nobody caught 'em
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes
And, Jesus, people bought 'em
And they called it paradise
The place to be
They watched the hazy sun
Sinking in the sea

You can leave it all behind
And sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did
So many years ago
They even brought a neon sign
"Jesus is coming"
They brought the white man's burden down
Brought the white man's reign

Who will provide the grand design?
What is yours and what is mine?
'Cause there is no more new frontier
But we have got to make it here
We satisfy our endless needs
And justify our bloody deeds
In the name of destiny
And in the name of God

And you can see them there
On Sunday morning
And stand up and sing about
What it's like up there
They call it paradise
I don't know why
You call someplace paradise
Kiss it goodbye

[Song 9: Take It to the Limit]
38 ContributorsTake It to the Limit Lyrics
All alone at the end of the evening
When the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have loved me, I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round) and it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down) but the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out and turning out the same

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow, would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom (Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door (Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back, you're coming back for more

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Wee-ee)
Take it to the limit (C'mon)
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Wee-ee)
Take it to the limit (You gotta)
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Wee-ee)
Take it to the limit (Come on and)
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit (Ah-ah)
Take it to the limit (Ah-ah)
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit

Every night, I'm lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough

I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love

Beautiful faces and loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above

But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(You get the best of my love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(You get the best of my love)

(Ooh) I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today?
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away
(Ooh, ooh) You know we always had each other, baby
(Ooh, ooh) I guess that wasn't enough

Oh-uh-oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(The best of my love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(The best of my love)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
Ev'ry night and day
You get the best of my love

Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(You get the best of my love)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love

Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
Mm-mm-mm-mm-hmm
You get the best of my love

You get the best of my love

There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar
Great expectations, everybody's watching you
People you meet, they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new

Johnny-come-lately, the new kid in town
Everybody loves you, so don't let them down

You look in her eyes, the music begins to play
Hopeless romantics, here we go again
But after a while, you're lookin' the other way
It's those restless hearts that never mend (Oh)

Johnny-come-lately, the new kid in town
Will she still love you when you're not around?

There's so many things you should have told her
But night after night, you're willing to hold her, just hold her
Tears on your shoulder

There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you
Doesn't really matter which side you're on
You're walking away and they're talking behind you
They will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along

Where you've been lately? There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?
He's holding her and you're still around

Oh, my, my
There's a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town

Well, baby, there you stand
With your little head down in your hand
Oh, my God, you can't believe
It's happening again
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone
And it looks like the end

And you're back out on the street
And you're trying to remember, oh
How do you start it over?
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man

You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time

The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell, fell
You didn't love the boy too much
No, no, you just
Loved the boy too well
Farewell

So you live from day to day
And you dream about tomorrow, oh
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To let them go away

And I could've done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind
From wonderin' what I left behind
And from worryin' 'bout this wasted time

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Another love has come and gone
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me
Before you went out on your own
"Sometimes to keep it together
We've got to leave it alone"

So you can get on with your search, baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time

'Cause I'm already standin'

What a woman can do to your soul
Aw, but she can't take you anyway
You don't already know how to go

And I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'

I get this feelin' I may know you
As a lover and a friend
But this voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again

Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be

And I can't tell you why

Before the night is through

Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on

This night is gonna last forever
Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shinin' bright
So turn out the light and we'll get it right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Heartache, baby

Somebody's gonna hurt someone (somebody)
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone

To make it come out right

We can beat around the bushes
We can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parkin' lot
But either way

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know (Lord, I know)
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Woo-woo!

And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of thyme-sweetened honey

Well, I heard some people talkin' just the other day
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
But let me tell you I got some news for you
And you'll soon find out it's true
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself

'Cause I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song

Woo hoo hoo, my my
Woo hoo hoo

The letter that you wrote me
Made me stop and wonder why
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right
Just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky
You can see the stars and still not see the light
(That's right)

And I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song

Woo hoo hoo, my my
Woo hoo hoo


Well, I know it wasn't you who held me down
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free
So oftentimes it happens that we live our lives in chains
And we never even know we have the key

But me, I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing (I will sing) this vict'ry song
'Cause I'm already gone
Yes, I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song
'Cause I'm already gone

Yes, I'm already gone
Already gone
All right, nighty-night
Already gone
Already gone
Already gone

[Song 19: Please Come Home for Christmas]
16 ContributorsPlease Come Home for Christmas Lyrics
Bells will be ringing this sad, sad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing, "Silent Night" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Christmas carols by candlelight (Ooh, ooh)
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas, my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love

So won't you tell me you'll never more roam (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Christmas and New Year's will find you home (Ooh, ooh)
There will be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again


Ooh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again

They were dueling, Doolin-Dalton
High or low, it was the same
Easy money and faithless women
Red-eye whiskey for the pain

Go down, Bill Dalton, it must be God's will
Two brothers lying dead in Coffeyville
Two voices call to you from where they stood
Lay down your law books now, they're no damn good

Better keep on moving, Doolin-Dalton
'Til your shadow sets you free
And if you're fast, and if you're lucky
You will never see that hanging tree

Well, the towns lay out across the dusty plains
Like graveyards filled with tombstones, waiting for the names
And a man could use his back or use his brains
But some just went stir crazy, Lord, 'cause nothing ever changed

'Til Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton
He was working cheap, just biding time
Then he laughed and said, "I'm going"
And so he left that peaceful life behind, 'hind

[Song 21: The Long Run]
10 ContributorsThe Long Run Lyrics
I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out till the break of day
Oh, that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way

Oh, I did some damage
I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely
Till I found you

You can go the distance
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)

People talking about us
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down
We will still come through

In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run

You know I don't understand
Why you don't treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
Cause all the debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you

Did you do it for love?
Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite?
Did you think you had to, honey?

Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)

Well, we're scared
But we ain't shakin'
Kinda bent
But we ain't breakin'

In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run
In the long run
In the long run

Gonna find out, ooh fa-fa-fa-find out
Long-long-long-long, long-long-long-long
Ooh, run-run-run, baby, run-run, baby
Long, long, long, long

[Song 22: The Heart of the Matter]
6 ContributorsThe Heart of the Matter LyricsI got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?
I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
... People filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age
The trust and self-assurance that can lead to happiness
They're the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
Doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, Baby
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out, I have to learn again
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore
There are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down and hurt your pride
Better put it all behind you; life goes on
You keep carrin' that anger, it'll eat you inside
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinkin' about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

[Song 23: King of Hollywood]
13 ContributorsKing of Hollywood Lyrics
Well, he sits up there on his leatherette
Looks through pictures of the ones that he hasn't had yet
When he thinks he wants a closer look
He gets out his little black telephone book
He's calling, calling, calling
He's calling, calling, calling
He's calling, calling, calling
He's calling

Come sit down here beside me, honey
Let's have a little heart to heart
Now look at me and tell me, darling
How badly do you want this part?
Are you willing to sacrifice?
And are you willing to be real nice?
All your talent and my good taste
I'd hate to see it go to waste

We gon' get you an apartment, honey
We gon' get you a car
(Yeah, we're going to take care of you, darling)
We gon' make you a movie star
For years I've seen 'em come and go
He says, "I've had 'em all, ya know."
I handled everything in my own way
I made 'em what they are today

{Guitar Solo 1}

After 'while nothing was pretty
After 'while everything got lost
Still, his Jacuzzi runneth over
Still he just couldn't get off
He's just another power junky
Just another silk scarf monkey
You'd know it if you saw his stuff
The man just isn't big enough

What kind of love have you got?
You should be home, but you're not
A room full of noise and dangerous boys
Still makes you thirsty and hot

I heard about you and that man
There's just one thing I don't understand
You say he's a liar and he put out your fire
How come you still got his gun in your hand?

Victim of love, I see a broken heart
You got your stories to tell
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well

Some people never come clean
Oh, I think you know what I mean, oh
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire
Looking for love in between

Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
A-this ain't no time to be cool
And tell all your girlfriends, your been-around-the-world friends
That talk is for losers and fools

Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no, I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
Show me, what kind of love have you got?


Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
What kind of love have you got?

Victim of love, you're just a victim of love
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no, I'm not
Victim of love, now you're a victim of love
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?

19 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPretty Maids All in a Row LyricsThe first song sung by Joe Walsh after he joined The Eagles, Pretty Maids All In A Row depicts the meeting of old friends or lovers, and the feelings that come from such an event.
Hi there, how are you? It's been a long time
Seems like we've come a long way
My, but we learn so slow
And heroes, they come and they go
And leave us behind as if we're supposed to know
Why
Why
Why do we give up our hearts to the past?
And why must we grow up so fast?

And all you wishing well fools with your fortunes
Someone should send you a rose
With love from a friend, it's nice to hear from you again
And the storybook comes to a close
Gone are the ribbons and bows
Things to remember, places to go
Pretty maids all in a row

Where your memories can find you
Like a circle goes around
You were lost until you found out
What it all comes down to
One by one the lonely feelings come
Day by day they slowly fade away
Ooh, the look was in her eyes
You never know what might be found there
She was dancing right in time
And the moves she made so fine
Like the music that surrounds her
Should I stay or go? I really want to know
Would I lose or win if I try and love again?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love
Right or wrong, what's done is done
It's only moments that you borrow
But the thoughts will linger on
Of the lady and her song
When the sun comes up tomorrow
Well, it might take years
To see through all these tears
Don't let go
When you find it, you will know

Same dances in the same old shoes
Some habits that you just can't lose
There's no telling what a man might use
After the thrill is gone
The flame rises but it soon descends
Empty pages and a frozen pen
You're not quite lovers and you're not quite friends
After the thrill is gone, oh
After the thrill is gone
What can you do when your dreams come true
And it's not quite like you planned?
What have you done to be losing the one
You held it so tight in your hand well
Time passes and you must move on
Half the distance takes you twice as long
So you keep on singing for the sake of the song
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone

You're afraid you might fall out of fashion
And you're feeling cold and small
Any kind of love without passion
That ain't no kind of loving at all, well

Same dances in the same old shoes
You get too careful with the steps you choose
You don't care about winning but you don't want to lose
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone, oh
After the thrill is gone

I turn on the tube and what do I see?
A whole lot of people crying, "Don't blame me"
They point their crooked little fingers at everybody else
Spend all their time feeling sorry for themselves
Victim of this, victim of that
Your mamma's too thin and your daddy's too fat

Get over it
Get over it
All this whining and crying and pitching a fit
Get over it, get over it

You say you haven't been the same since you had your little crash
But you might feel better if I gave you some cash
The more I think about it, Old Billy was right
Let's kill all the lawyers, kill 'em tonight
You don't want to work, you want to live like a king
But the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing

Get over it
Get over it
If you don’t wanna play then you might as well quit
Get over it, get over it

It's like going to confession every time I hear you speak
You're making the most of your losing streak
Some call it sick, but I call it weak
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, you drag it around like a ball and chain
You wallow in the guilt, you wallow in the pain
You wave it like a flag, you wear it like a crown
Got your mind in the gutter, bringing everybody down
You bitch about the present and blame it on the past
I'd like to find your inner child and kick its little ass

Get over it

All this bitching and moaning and pitching a fit
Get over it, get over it

Get over it
It's gotta stop sometime, so why don't you quit?
Get over it, get over it

Tell us what you're gonna do tonight to mama
There must be someplace you can go
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama
There must be someone you know
God knows you're looking good enough
But you're so smooth and the world's so rough
You might have something to lose
Oh no, pretty mama
What you gonna do in those shoes?

Got those pretty little straps around your ankles
Got those shiny little chains around your heart
You got to have your independence
But you don't know just where to start
Desperation in the singles bars
An' all those jerkoffs in their fancy cars
You can't believe your reviews
Oh no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes
{Guitar Solo}

They're looking at you, leaning on you
Tell you anything you wanna hear
They give you tablets of love
They're waiting for you
Got to score you
Handy with a shovel and so sincere
Ooh, they got the kid glove

You just want someone to talk to
They just wanna get their hands on you
You get whatever you choose
Oh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes
Oh, no, you can't do that

I make my living off the evening news
Just give me something, something I can use
People love it when you lose, they love dirty laundry
Well, I coulda been an actor, but I wound up here
I just have to look good, I don't have to be clear
Come and whisper in my ear, give us dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em all around

We got the bubble-headed bleach-blonde who comes on at five
She can tell you about the plane crash with a gleam in her eye
It's interesting when people die, give us dirty laundry
Can we film the operation? Is the head dead yet?
You know the boys in the newsroom got a running bet
Get the widow on the set, we need dirty laundry


You don't really need to find out what's goin' on
You don't really want to know just how far it's gone
Just leave well enough alone, keep your dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're stiff, kick 'em all around

(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)

Dirty little secrets, dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie
Love to cut you down to size, we love dirty laundry
We can do the innuendo, we can dance and sing
When it's said and done, we haven't told you a thing
We all know that crap is king, give us dirty laundry

Well the stage was set, the sun was sinkin' low down
As they came to town to face another showdown
The lawmen cleared the people from the street
"All you blood-thirsty bystanders, will you try to find your seats?"

Watch 'em duelin' (Duelin'), Doolin-Dalton (Dalton)
High or low, (High, low), it's all the same
Easy money and faithless women
You will never kill the pain

Go down, Bill Doolin, don't you wonder why
Sooner or later we all have to die?
Sooner or later, that's a stone-cold fact
Four men ride out and only three ride back


The queen of diamonds let you down, she was just an empty fable
The queen of hearts you say you never met
Your twisted fate has found you out and it's finally turned the tables
Stole your dreams and paid you with regret

Desperado (Is there gonna be anything left, is there gonna be anything?)
You sealed your fate up a long time ago (Ain't it hard when you're all alone in the center ring?)
Now there's no time left to borrow (Is there gonna be anything left?)
Only stardust (Maybe tomorrow)

Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow

Somewhere out  on that horizon
Out beyond the neon lights
I know there must be something better
But there's nowhere else in sight

It's survival in the city
When you live from day to day
City streets don't have much pity
When you're down, that's where you'll stay

In the city (oh, oh)
In the city (oh, ohhh)

I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
Nothing grows and life ain't very pretty
No one's there to catch you when you fall

Somewhere out on that horizon
Far away from the neon sky
I know there must be something better
And I can't stay another night

In the city (oh, oh)
In the city (oh, ohhh)

In the city

In the city (oh, ohhh)

Wondering who is really in the driver's seat

Don't you tell me about your law and order
I'm trying to change this water to wine

After a hard day, i'm safe at home
Fooling with my baby on the telephone
Out of nowhere somebody cuts in and
Says, "hmm, you in some trouble boy, we know where you're been."

I'm out on the border, I thought this was a private line
Don't you tell me about your law and order
I'm trying to change this water to wine

Never mind your name, just give us your number, mm
Never mind your face, just show us your card, mm
And we wanna know whose wing are you under
You better step to the right or we can make it hard

I'm stuck on the border
All I wanted was some peace of mind
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
I'm trying to change this water to wine

On the border

Leave me be , i'm just walking this line

Can't you see i'm trying to change this water to wine

Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
Sick and tired of all your law and order
On the border
Sick and tired of it
On the border

[Song 34: New York Minute]
6 ContributorsNew York Minute Lyrics
Harry got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street
In the morning
He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute

Lying here in the darkness
I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency
Somebody's going to jail
If you find somebody to love in this world
You better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute

And in these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love
You better take a fool's advice
And take care of your own
One day they're here
Next day they're gone
I pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark
"Baby, I've changed. Please come back"
What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
But I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe
I believe, I believe

In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute

It's coming on the end of August
Another summer's promise almost gone
And though I heard some wise man say
That every dog will have his day
He never mentioned that these dog days get so long
I don't know when I realized the dream was over
Well, there was no particular hour, no given day
You know, it didn't go down in flame
There was no final scene, no frozen frame
I just watched it slowly fade away

And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for my time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
I've been keeping to myself
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though you're with somebody else
He'll never love you like I do

I've been biding time with the crows and sparrows
While peacocks prance and strut upon the stage
If finding love is just a dance
Proximity and chance
You will excuse me if I skip the masquerade

And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the dust to settle down along the
Back roads running through the fields
Lying on the outskirts of this lonesome town

And I imagine sunlight in your hair
You're at the county fair
You're holding hands and laughing
And now the ferris-wheel has stopped
You're swinging on the top
Suspended there with him
And he's the darling of the chic
The flavor of the week is melting
Down your pretty summer dress
Baby, what a mess you're making


I've been stumbling through some dark places
Now I'm following the plow
I know I've fallen out of your good graces
It's alright now

And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the summer rain to fall upon the
Wild birds scattering the seeds
Answering the calling of the tide's eternal tune

The phases of the moon
The chambers of the heart
The egg and dart of small gray
Spiders spinning in the dark
In spite of all the times the web is torn apart

And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
I've been keeping to myself
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though you're with somebody else

7 ContributorsLearn to Be Still Lyrics
It's just another day in paradise
As you stumble to your bed
You'd give anything to silence
Those voices ringing in your head
You thought you could find happiness
Just over that green hill
You thought you would be satisfied
But you never will

Learn to be still

We are like sheep without a shepherd
We don't know how to be alone
So we wander around this desert
And wind up following the wrong gods home
But the flock cries out for another
And they keep answering that bell
And one more starry-eyed messiah
Meets a violent farewell
Learn to be still

Now the flowers in your garden
They don't smell so sweet
Maybe you've forgotten
The heaven lying at your feet


There are so many contradictions
In all these messages we send
(We keep asking)
How do I get out of here
Where do I fit in?
Though the world is torn and shaken
Even if your heart is breaking
It's waiting for you to awaken
And someday you will
Learn to be still

You just keep on running
Keep on running

I lost ten points just for being in the right place
At exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there, but I may as well
Have been completely blind

So if you see me walking all alone
Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home
And there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

She signed me to a contract
Baby said it would all be so life long
I looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't something more to blame it on

But if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now and I won't be hanging on
And there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

"1320 North Columbus" was the address
That I wrote down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
It might have been that it was getting time to leave

And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said, "Lead on"
'Cause there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

There's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

[Song 38: Hollywood Waltz]
11 ContributorsHollywood Waltz Lyrics
Springtime, and the acacias are blooming
Southern California will see one more day
Dreamland, and bus'ness is booming
The birds are a singing as I drift away

She looks another year older
From too many lovers who used her and ran
But some nights, oh, she looks like an angel
And she's always willing to hold you again

So give her this dance
She can't be forsaken
Learn how to love her
With all of her faults
She gave more than she's taken
And I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz

Springtime and the lady is grieving
The lovers just stand there with nothing to say
They got what they wanted
They're packing and leaving
To look for another to love the same way

So give her this dance
She can't be forsaken
Learn how to love her
With all of her faults
She gave more than she's taken
And I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz
The Hollywood Waltz

[Song 39: The Sad Café]
14 ContributorsThe Sad Café Lyrics
Out in the shiny night, the rain was softly falling
Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Café
Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say
We thought we could change this world with words like "love" and "freedom"
We were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Café

Oh, expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by

Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind, inside the Sad Café
{Acoustic Solo}

The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and lets the rest go free

Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all
No use in asking why, it just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Café
Why don't you meet me at midnight, baby, inside the Sad Café
{Saxophone Solo}

Well, my time went too quickly
I went lickety-splitly out to my ol' 55
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive

And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know the feelings getting stronger

Six in the morning, gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Now the cars are all passing me
Trucks are all flashing me
I'm headed home from your place

And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know the feelings getting stronger

Well, my time went too quickly
I went lickety-splitly out to my ol' 55
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive

And now the sun's coming up, yes it is
I'm riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Freeway cars and trucks
Riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Riding with lady luck

I wish you peace when the cold winds blow
Warmed by the fire's glow
I wish you comfort in the, the lonely time
And arms to hold you when you ache inside
Wish you hope when things are going bad
Kind words when times are sad
I wish you shelter from the, the raging wind
Cooling waters at the fever's end

I wish you peace when times are hard
A light to guide you through the dark
And when storms are high and your, your dreams are low
I wish you the strength to let love grow on
Wish you the strength to let love flow


Wish you peace when times are hard
A light to guide you through the dark
And when storms are high and your, your dreams are low
Wish you the strength to let love grow on

I wish you the strength to let love flow on
I wish you the strength to let love go

I know just what you mean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look alright
If I could see it on the silver screen
You were the lowdown rebel if there ever was
Even if you had no cause
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
We'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator
You were just too cool for school
Sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop
The only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules
James Dean, James Dean
So hungry and so lean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
Little James Dean, up on the screen
Wondering who he might be
Along came a Spyder and picked up a rider
And took him down the road to eternity

James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen
James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen
You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye, bye

[Song 43: My Man]
17 ContributorsMy Man Lyrics“My Man” is Bernie Leadon’s touching tribute to his old band member and friend, Gram Parsons, who died of a morphine and alcohol overdose in California’s Joshua Tree National Park the previous year.
Tell me , how do you feel?
Like you're rolling so fast that you're spinning your wheels?
Don't feel too bad, you're not all along
We're all trying to get along
With everybody else trying to go their way
You're bound to get tripped, and what can you say?
Just go along until they turn out the lights
There's nothing we can do to fight it

No man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain
And we who must remain go on living just the same

I once knew a man, very talented guy
He's sing for the people and people would cry
They knew that his song came from deep down inside
You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes
And so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone
Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind
Called him home


We who must remain go on laughing just the same

5 ContributorsThe Greeks Don’t Want No Freaks Lyrics(Hey!)

There was beer all over the dance floor
And the band was playing rhythm and blues
You got down and did the gator and half an hour later
You were barfing all over your girlfriend's shoes

But the Greeks don't want no freaks
The Greeks don't want no freaks
Just put a little smile on them rosy cheeks
Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks
(Gator!!)
(Yeah, woooo.... woo. Aaow!)

She was the pride and the passion of Dixie
She did exactly what her daddy had planned
She was the perfect little sister until somebody missed her
And they found her in the bushes with the boys in the band

But the Greeks don't want no freaks
No, the Greeks don't want no freaks
So put a great big smile on them rosy cheeks
Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks
No, the Greeks don't want no freaks
Said, the Greeks don't want no freaks

Just put that monster smile on them rosy cheeks
Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks
No, the Greeks don't want no freaks

[Song 45: Saturday Night]
10 ContributorsSaturday Night Lyrics
Seems like a dream now, it was so long ago
The moon burned so bright and the time went so slow
And I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring
The bluebird was high on the wing

Whatever happened to Saturday night?
Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight
She said, "Tell me, oh, tell me, was I all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

The years brought the railroad, it ran by my door
Now there's boards on the windows and dust on the floor
And she passes the time at another man's side
And I pass the time with my pride

What a tangled web we weave
Go 'round with circumstance
Someone show me how to tell
The dancer from the dance

Whatever happened to Saturday night?
Choosing a friend and losing the fight
She said, "Tell me, oh, tell me, are you all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

Whatever happened to Saturday night?

[Song 46: One Day at a Time]
2 ContributorsOne Day at a Time Lyrics
Well you know I was always the first to arrive at the party
Oh, and the last to leave the scene of the crime
Well it started with a couple of beers
And it went I don't know how many years
Like a run away train heading for the
End of the line
Well I finally got around to admit that I might have a problem
But I thought it was just too damn big of a mountain to climb
Well I got down on my knees and said
"Hey I just can't go on living this way
Guess I have to learn to live my life
One day at a time"

Oh yeah, one day at a time
Oh yeah, one day at a time


Oh yeah, one day at a time
Oh yeah, one day at a time

Well I finally got around to admit that I was the problem
When I use to put the blame on everybody's shoulders but mine
All the friends I use to run with are gone
But I hadn't planned on living this long
Have to learn to live my life
One day at a time
It was something I was too blind to see
I got help from something greater then me
And I have to learn to live my life
One day at a time

6 ContributorsHole in the World Lyrics
There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

They say that anger is just love disappointed
They say that love is just a state of mind
But all this fighting over who is anointed
Oh how can people be so blind?

There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

Oh they tell me there's a place over yonder
Cool water running through the burning sand
Until we we learn to love one another
We will never reach the promised land

There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
(They say that anger is just love disappointed)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
(They say that love is just a state of mind)
There's a hole in the world tonight
(But all this fighting over who will be anointed)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
(Oh how can people be so blind?)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Hole in the world)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (Fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Mmm)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight (There's a hole in the world)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (A cloud of fear and sorrow)

Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

There's a hole in the world tonight (Mmm yeah)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow

There's a hole in the world tonight

Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow (Mmm)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Mmm)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (A cloud of fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Great big hole in the world)

[Song 48: The Girl from Yesterday]
3 ContributorsThe Girl from Yesterday Lyrics
It wasn't really sad the way they said good-bye
Or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldn't cry
He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away

And she became the girl from yesterday

He took a plane across the sea
To some foreign land
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand
How someone who had been so close could be so far away

And she became the girl from yesterday

She doesn't know what's right
She doesn't know what's wrong
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long
And she doesn't count the teardrops
That she's cried while he's away
Because she knows deep in her heart
That he'll be back someday

The light's on in the window, she's waiting by the phone
Talking to a memory that's never coming home
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say

But, she'll always be the girl from yesterday

[Song 49: Long Road Out of Eden]
11 ContributorsLong Road Out of Eden Lyrics

Moon shining down through the palms
Shadows moving on the sand
Somebody whispering the twenty-third psalm
Dusty rifle in his trembling hands
Somebody trying just to stay alive
He got promises to keep
Over the ocean in America
Far away and fast asleep

Silent stars blinking in the blackness of an endless sky
Cold silver satellites, ghostly caravans passing by
Galaxies unfolding, new worlds being born
Pilgrims and prodigals creeping toward the dawn

And it's a long road out of Eden

Music blasting from an SUV
On a bright and sunny day
Rolling down the interstate
In the good old USA
Having lunch at the petroleum club
Smoking fine cigars and swapping lives
He said, "Give me another slice of that barbecued brisket!"
"Give me another piece of that pecan pie!"

Freeways flickering, cell phones chiming a tune
We're riding to utopia, road map says we'll be arriving soon
Captains of the old order clinging to the reins
Assuring us these aches inside are only growing pains

But it's a long road out of Eden

Back home I was so certain
The path was very clear
But now I have to wonder
What are we doing here?
I'm not counting on tomorrow
And I can't tell wrong from right
But I'd give anything to be there in your arms tonight


Weaving down the American highway
Through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk
Bloated with entitlement, loaded on propaganda
And now we're driving dazed and drunk
Been down the road to Damascus
The road to Mandalay
Met the ghost of Caesar on the Appian way
He said, "It's hard to stop this binging, once you get a taste"
"But the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste"

Behold the bitten apple, the power of the tools
But all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools

And it's a long road out of Eden

Most of us are sad
No one lets it show
I've been shadows of myself
How was I to know?

Tell me scarlet sun
What will time allow?
We have brought our children here
Who can save them now?
Oh, Weeping woman try to smile
Like the coming dawn
Most of us are sad it's true
Still we must go on
Love was here today
Oh the sun was bright
I will sing you far away
Love is here tonight

Most of us are sad
No one lets it show
I've been shadows of myself
How was I to know?

Visions, that you stir in my soul
Visions, that will never grow old
Sweet baby, i had some visions of you
If i can't have it all, just a taste will do
Go ahead and live all your fantasies
(Don't you ever think about the other side?)
Helps you get from where you are
To where you want to be
(You and me ought to be taking a ride)
You do the best you can
And you make your mistakes
(If you don't like it, you can say that you tried)
Because all i have to give is whatever it takes
Play on, el chingadero, play on
Play on, el chingadero
Dance, angel, dance until you wear out your blues
(Only thing that's gonna save you now)
Take another chance, you got nothing to lose
(The boy didn't love you anyhow)
Girl, you drive me wild when you do what you do
(Something makes me want to take you down)
If i can't have it all, just a taste will do
Just a taste of you

[Song 52: No More Cloudy Days]
5 ContributorsNo More Cloudy Days Lyrics
Sitting by a foggy window
Staring at the pouring rain
Falling down like lonely teardrops
Memories of love in vain
These cloudy days, make you want to cry
It breaks your heart when someone leaves and you don't know why
I can see that you've been hurting, baby I've been lonely too
I've been out here lost and searching, looking for a girl like you
Now I believe the sun is going to shine
Don't you be afraid to love again, put your hand in mine

Baby, I would never make you cry
I would never make you blue
I would never let you down
I would never be untrue

I know a place where we can go where true love always stays
There's no more stormy nights, no more cloudy days

I believe in second chances
I believe in angels, too
I believe in new romances
Baby, I believe in you
These cloudy days are coming to an end
And you don't have to be afraid to fall in love again

5 ContributorsHow Long Lyrics
Like a blue bird with his heart removed, lonely as a train
I've run just as far as I can run
If I never see the good old days shining in the sun
I'll be doing fine and then some

How long, how long
Woman, will you weep?
How long, how long
Rock yourself to sleep

Well, I've been doing time in lonesome prison, where the sun doesn't shine
Just outside, the freedom river runs
Out there in that shiny night, with blood hounds on your mind
Don't you know it's the same sad situation?



Everybody feels alright you know, I heard some poor fool say (Somebody Ooh)
Everyone is out there on the loose
Well I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name
But what you get is not quite what you choose


How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Muddy River runs so deep
How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Good night baby, rock yourself to sleep
Sleep tight baby, rock yourself to sleep
Bye bye baby, rock yourself to sleep

10 ContributorsCertain Kind of Fool Lyrics
He was a poor boy, raised in a small family
He kinda had a craving for something no one else could see
They said that he was crazy, the kind that no lady should meet
He ran off to the city and wandered around in the street

He wants to dance, oh yeah
He wants to sing, oh yeah
He wants to see the lights a-flashing
And listen to the thundering

He saw it in a window, the mark of a new kind of man
He kind of liked the feeling, so shiny and smooth in his hand
He took it to the country and practiced for days without rest
And then one day he felt it, he knew he could stand with the best

They got respect, oh yeah
He wants the same, oh yeah
And it's a certain kind of fool
That likes to hear the sound of his own name


A poster on a storefront, the picture of a wanted man
He had a reputation spreading like fire through the land
It wasn't for the money, at least it didn't start that way
It wasn't for the running, but now he's running every day

Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what
Happened to our love
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and you're
Smiling at everyone
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
Out on the road today I saw a Black Head
Sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said:
"Don't look back, you can never look back"
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go, but...
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got that top pulled down
And that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got that hair slicked back
And those Wayfarers on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son
The highway is my legacy, on the highway I will run
In one hand I've a Bible, in the other I've got a gun
Well, don't you know me? I'm the man who won

Woman, don't try to love me, don't try to understand
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man

First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe
Headed for Oklahoma, I was riding night and day
All of my friends are strangers, they quickly come and go
And all my love's in danger 'cause I steal hearts and souls

Woman, don't try to love me, don't try to understand
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man


Woman, don't try to love me, don't try to understand
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw

Some men call me Abel, some men call me Cain
Some men call me Sinner, Lord, and some men call me Saint
Some say there's a Jesus, some men say there ain't
When you got no life to lose, then there's nothing left to gain

Oh, my, don't the sky look spacious
With the stars all shining down?
Well, I can hear the night wind howling
It's a high and lonesome sound
And I ain't had a woman in so long
I need to feed my starving soul
Come on, saddle up, boys, we're gonna ride into town
We're gonna get a little out of control

There's a card game in the corner
And the barmaid smiled at me
Well, I tipped her a sliver dollar and
She brought me a drink for free
All the town-folk call her the cheap one
And the gamblers call her Flo
Come on, set 'em up again, I got me a friend
And I think I'm getting out of control

Oh, oh, oh

She's cool water, mama taught her
I got news, she's mine and mine alone

Well, if anybody's looking for trouble
You know I'm the one you want to try
Well, I'll fight any man who wants to
And I don't care who or why
You got to gamble on your story
You got no guts, you get no glory
And I'm betting my money on an ace in the hole
Think I'm getting out of control

You've done it now
Where's my baby? Where'd you go, baby?

Is where I go when I wanna hide

Oh, peyote (Oh, peyote, ooh)
She tried to show me (Tried to show me)
You know there ain't no cause to weep at Bitter Creek

We're gonna hit the road for one last time

No more runnin' (No more runnin')
And I can't wait to see the old man's face when I win the race

And what would set me free
Is if the same thing happened to everybody
That just happened to me

No no, no, no
No, whoa, I'll never let her go
No no, no

And every time I hear somebody
Sneaking up behind
Whoa, I turn around but I still hear that sound
And just when I'm about to lose my mind

Here comes my baby
Singing like a nightingale
Coming my way
Down along that devastation trail
Well, tell the Lord above
She's got a brand of love that cannot fail

I'm hanging on to my peace of mind
And that's no lie
I'm hanging on to my special friend
The apple of my eye
The apple of my eye, my inspiration too
She's got a lead on my heart and my soul
And she knows just what to do

Oh, whoa, I just don't know

No, whoa, I get so low and my mind's about to go

But wait a minute, here comes my baby
Singing like a nightingale
Coming my way
Down along that devastation trail
Well, let the fires burn
And let the floods return, we will prevail

Hanging on to my peace of mind
I just don't know

You don't even know why you're here
Wait for the weekend to go off the deep end
And make everything disappear

You're lost in a teenage jail
So young and so vicious and so frail
Where something is always for sale
You're lost in a teenage jail

You're not like your mothers (not like your mother!)
You're not like the others (not like the other!)
You're not quite like anyone else (You're not quite like anyone else, no, no)
They don't even know you
Got nothing to show you
So get something good for yourself

[Song 61: It’s Your World Now]
3 ContributorsIt’s Your World Now Lyrics
A perfect day, the sun is sinking low
As evening falls, the gentle breezes blow
The time we shared went by so fast
Just like a dream, we knew it couldn't last
But I'd do it all again
If I could, somehow
But I must be leaving soon
It's your world now

It's your world now
My race is run
I'm moving on
Like the setting sun
No sad goodbyes
No tears allowed
You'll be alright
It's your world now

Even when we are apart
You'll always be in my heart
When dark clouds appear in the sky
Remember true love never dies
But first a kiss, one glass of wine
Just one more dance while there's still time
My one last wish, someday, you'll see
How hard I tried and how much you meant to me

It's your world now
Use well, the time
Be part of something good
Leave something good behind
The curtain falls
I take my bow
That's how it's meant to be

It's your world now

Jumping up, falling down
Don't misunderstand me

[Song 63: Busy Being Fabulous]
5 ContributorsBusy Being Fabulous Lyrics
I came home to an empty house
And I found your little note
"Don't wait up for me tonight"
And that was all she wrote
Do you think I don't know that you're out on the town
With all of your high-rolling friends?
What do you do when you come up empty?
Where do you go when the party ends?

And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
I don't know what you were dreaming of
Somehow you forgot about love
And you were just too busy being fabulous, uh-huh

A little time in the country
A day or two to slow down
A bottle of wine and a walk in the moonlight
Maybe some fooling around
But you think time is just a magazine
And money's just a thrill
I've waited so long for you to change your way of living
Now I realize that you never will


You tell a joke and everybody's laughing
That's something you know how to do
You've always been the life of the party
But now my baby, the joke is on you
Because you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
Running after something that never comes
What in the world are you running from?
And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
To drink the wine from your winner's cup
To notice the children were growing up

And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy, too busy
Too busy
Aw, baby

[Song 64: Too Many Hands]
9 ContributorsToo Many Hands Lyrics
She's one of a kind
Sometimes hard to find
Like a rainbow
Well, she's lost all her glory
And could tell you some stories
That we all should know

And there's too many hands
Being laid on her
Too many eyes will never see
That it's dragging her down
But you won't hear a sound as
She turns around

Her beauty all aflight
It always seems to turn the tide
At midnight
And for her there is no rest
We are doing what is best
For our future
One of these days she may not
Be so good to you
One of these days she might
Shake you to the ground
But her fire is still
Burning
And her heart is still yearning
To be found

And there's too many hands
Being laid on her
Too many eyes will never see
That it's dragging her down
But you won't hear a sound as
She turns around

Too many hands

[Song 65: Midnight Flyer]
8 ContributorsMidnight Flyer Lyrics
Oo, midnight flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Oo, midnight flyer
I paid my dues and i feel like traveling on

A runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay
So throw your rope on another man
And pull him down your way
Make him into someone who can take the place of me
Make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be


Maybe I'll go to Santa Fe
Maybe San Antone
Any town is where I'm bound
Any way to get me gone
Don't think about me
Never let me cross your mind
Except when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whine


I paid my dues and I feel like travelin' on

[Song 66: Twenty-One]
9 ContributorsTwenty-One Lyrics
Twenty-one and strong as I can be
I know what freedom means to me
And I can't give a reason why
I should ever want to die

Got no cause to be afraid
Or fear that life will ever fade
'Cause as I watch the rising sun
I know that we have just begun

I might spend my life upon the road
Just trying to add to what I know
And someday I might settle down
And all my friends will be around


They say a man should have a stock and trade
But me, I'll find another way
I believe in getting what you can
And there ain't no stopping this young man

Because I'm young and fast as I can be
I know what freedom means to me
And I can't give a reason why
I should ever want to die

Yeah, and I can't give a reason why
I should ever want to die

Woke up dreamin' along the way
Never quite seems the same when you awakin'
And makin' up for the time you've such a price to pay
And then they take the dream away, and it just ain't fair
Help me thru the night Mama, help me to ease the pain
Tell me it's alright, help me thru the night once again
That's the danger in petending
Trying to defend yourself from someone else's war
Don't know what they're fighting for
And they just don't care

Tell me it's alright, help me thru the night once again

[Song 68: Life’s Been Good]
5 ContributorsLife’s Been Good Lyrics
I have a mansion, forget the price
Ain't never been there, they tell me it's nice
I live in hotels, tear out the walls
I have accountants pay for it all

They say I'm crazy, but I have a good time, yes I do
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
Life's been good to me so far

My Maserati does 185
I lost my license, now I don't drive
I have a limo, ride in the back
I lock the doors and watch the war in Iraq

I make hit records, my fans they can't wait
They write me letters, tell me Glenn's great
So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
Just leave a message, maybe I'll call

Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
Everybody says, "I'm cool" (He's cool)
I can't complain, but sometimes I still do
Life's been good to me so far


I go to parties, sometimes until four
It's hard to leave when you can't find the door
(Come in)
Tough to handle this fortune and fame
Everybody's so damn different, we haven't changed

Oh, and sometimes I still cry
Everybody say, "Oh, yeah, yeah" (Oh, yeah)
Oh yeah
I keep on goin', guess I'll never know why
Life's been good to me so far
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wow, wow
Ah, ah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

7 ContributorsTake the Devil Lyrics
Open up your eyes
Take the devil from your mind
He's been holding on to you
And you're so hard to find
The wind outside is cold
Restless feeling in my soul
Tempting me to get away
But there's no place a man can go

God, will you lead me where I roam?
Help me not to let my feelings show
No, no

You are the one, oh
How could you be so blind?
The devil prays on runaways
He's never far behind
The many years I've tried
Now have been revealed to me
Closer is the love you'll find
Waiting so patiently

God, will you lead me where I roam?
Help me not to let my feelings show
No, no
Take the devil
Take the devil
From your mind

7 ContributorsThe Disco Strangler Lyrics
Looking for the good life
Dressed to kill
She don't have to worry
'Cause there's always someone else who will
Loose and loaded every night
Dancing underneath the flashing light saying
"Look at me, baby, look at me
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm somebody!"
Just slip into the arms of the disco strangler

He's been around here all along, baby
Been waiting for his time to come
You looking for attention, darling
He will surely give you some
He's the crimson in your face du jour
The fiddler in your darkest night
He's the melody without a cure
And Rome is burning but that's alright
Just slip into the arms of the disco strangler
Just slip into the arms of the disco strangler

Can't you see she wants you
She has you deep in her eyes
You been wondering why she haunts you
Beauty in the devil's disguise
She can tell you all about it
She sees it in the stars
She'll burn you if you try to put her down

Oh well, it's been a good day in hell
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound

Higher
She can keep you loaded
Feeding you whiskey and wine
Fire
The devil's on the phone
He laughs and says you're doing just fine
In that big book of names
I wanna go down in flames
Seein's how I'm goin' down


Truckin', that's all that I've been doin'
Every girl's a fork in the road
Stuck in some sticky situations
Feelin' like I wanna explode
All this gratification
And sick conversation
Someone get me out of town
Oh well, it's been a good day in hell
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound

The trees have all been cut down
And where once they stood
Not even a wagon rut
Appears along the path
Low brush is taking over
No more walks in the wood
This is the aftermath
Of afternoons in the clover fields
Where we once made love
Then wandered home together
Where the trees arched above
Where we made our own weather
When branches were the sky
Now they are gone for good
And you, for ill, and I
Am only a passer-by

Back from the fields of play
Lasted as long as we could

But that's all right
You know when I want you
Most every night
And I've been meaning to tell

Still I'm finally convinced

I believe we could chug all night

The band is loose and the groove
Is right you're so much woman I
Believe we could chug all night

On the day that I die, well
I just might scream
If I'm alive in the morning
I'll be alive in a dream
You better listen to me baby
Cause you know that I'm hung on you
Till I'm blind and black and blue
No one else will do

We're going to do a little chugging
We're going to do a little hugging
The band is loose and the groove is right
I'm wired for sound
Are you wired for light?
And you're so much woman
I believe we could chug all night

No woman ever do what you do
High on a pleasure wheel
No devil ever cast a voodoo
So long and dark and real

Early in the morning
About the break of day
The earlybird is working
So his life don't fade away
Spends his days denying that
He's got no time for flying
In the breeze
High up on his own, the eagle flies alone
And he is free
Earlybird is scratching though
The going's getting tough
Time is passing by him and he just
Can't get enough
He'll tell you all is going well
Though knows that something's wrong
The earlybird will wake one day
And find his life is gone
You know I like to lay in bed
And sleep out in the sun
Reading books and playing crazy music
Just for fun
You know it makes feel so fine
And sets my mind at ease to
Know that I don't harm a soul
In doing what I please

Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away
Any old day you say
Ain't going to fade away

You don't have to say a word
I can see it in your eyes
I know what you wanna say
It's so hard to say goodbye

I can hold back my tears
And try to be strong
While our love is falling apart
I know what I'll say
If you walk away
But what do I do?
What do I do with my heart?

I'm not gonna say a word
I know I can't change your mind
You know where you need to go
I know I'll be left behind

I won't hold you back
I won't stand in your way
If you need to make a new start
But I still wanna know
When my arms let you go
What do I do?
What do I do with my heart?

Oh, girl, don't you remember?
It was not so long ago
We were making plans for two
Just me and you
Now you tell me that you've found somebody
Someone who loves you better
But no one could ever love you
The way I do

(Tell me you're not leaving now)
Tell me you're not leaving
(Tell me that you're gonna stay)
Please say you'll stay with me, baby
(Tell me that you love me still)
Say you love me still
(For this and this alone I pray)
Fall down on my knees and pray

I'll do anything (Yes, I would)
To save what we have (To keep you by my side)
I'll love you 'til death do us part (Whoo)

When I'm still missing you? (Whoa)
What do I do?

You never cry like a lover should
Sigh when it feels real good
Or see the sky through the stone and wood
You never cry like a lover
I thought i saw somebody i loved
Sleeping deep inside you
If i could catch you in an unguarded moment
I'd stay right here beside you
You never smile at me late at night
Laugh out loud when we get it right
You can't get loose if there's too much light
You never smile like a lover
Try a little harder
I can't live with you baby, can't live without it
Try a little harder
And sometimes i believe in love
Sometimes i doubt it
But your life goes on
Like a broken down carousel
Where somebody left the music on

I was hoping you were the one 

You never move like you used to do
Pour it out when you're feeling blue
Somebody must have put some pain on you
You never cry like a lover
(you never cry like a lover)
Cry
(you never cry like a lover)
You never cry
(cry like a lover)
Come on and cry
(you never cry like a lover)
You never cry

Takes you for a fool
He's only looking for a good time
How can he love you when he
Treats you mean and cruel
He's not the best thing that you could find

Is it true?
I can't believe it
Is it true?
I just can't see it
Is it true?
Is that you?

When we were young, we didn't really have a care
You were hung up, i had a good line
I never knew it then but, man, i was in love
How could i know it was the right time?

Is it true?
I can't believe it
Is it true?
I just can't see it
Is it true?
Is that you?

Yes, i was so wrong
For leading you on
There wasn't much i could do
I was a wild one, but i can change some
If that's important to you

Is it true- you've lost that feeling?
Is it true- you might be leaving?
Is it true?
Is it true?
She's really leaving

She's really leaving

It's not the first time
That I've had the sense that something's wrong
But I'm old enough to know
That things don't always work out like they should
I know you're trying hard
To break it gently to me, now
But there's no easy way
To tell it like it is, so baby

I don't want to hear any more
You don't need to tell me it's over
I've been here before

I've seen that look before
I know it well, it comes as no surprise
You've been avoiding me
But now you want to talk it over
Before you take my hand
And tell me softly in a whisper
There's no need to explain
I've read the book, I know how this all ends


I won't ask you to stay
I won't stand in your way
Look me right in the eyes
Let me walk away with my head high
If there's some other guy
I don't need to know why


I won't ask you to stay
I won't stand in your way
And I don't want to hear any more
No, no, baby
I don't want to hear any more

I've been walking through the fields
And on the streets of town
Trying to make sense of what you left me
Everything that I believed in
Has been turned upside down
And now it seems the whole wide world's gone crazy
But when I feel like giving up
And I'm ready to walk away
In the stillness, I can hear
A voice inside me say

Do something, do something
It's too late for saving face
Don't just stand there taking up space
Why don't you do something?
Do something
It's not over
No, it's never too late

You were always on my side
Love was all we had
Now I sit and watch our love unraveling
I pick up the morning paper
All the news is bad
How did we get on this road we're traveling?
But when I feel like giving up
And there's nowhere left to go
That's the time I dig down deep
The only thing I know

Do something, do something
It's too late for saving face
Don't just stand there taking up space
Why don't you do something?
Do something
It's not over
No, it's never too late

Run away
You can't run away
For your honor
For your pride
You'll sleep better
Knowing you tried

To do something
Do something
It's too easy not to care
You're not ready for the rocking chair
Get up and do something
Do something
Don't wait too long
Even if it's wrong
You've got to do something
Do something
It's not over
No, it's never too late

And I'm going to make it with my friends
And I'm trying
It took me sometime to see it
Now I'm looking through this world
And it's going to take some time before
I get back, help me girl
Cause you can make it if you try
You got to lay it on the line
And everything will be fine if you try
Sitting smoking just a thinking
Is an easy thing to do
We got to keep on trying for
The feeling to come through
And it's a lonely way to live
You got to take it, you got to give
If you mistake it, just try again
And I'm trying, yeah!

Got to keep on trying
Ah, we got to keep on trying

3 ContributorsFrail Grasp on the Big Picture Lyrics
Well, ain't it a shame
'bout our short little memory?
Never seem to learn
The lessons of history
We keep making the same mistakes
Over and over and over and over again
And then we wonder why
We're in the shape we're in
Good old boys down at the bar
Peanuts and politics
They think they know it all
They don't know much of nothing
Even if one of them was to read a newspaper
Cover-to-cover
That ain't what's going on
Journalism dead and gone

Frail grasp on the big picture
Light fading and the fog is getting thicker
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
Dark ages

You, my love-drunk friend
All that red wine and candlelight
Soulful conversations
That go on until the dawn
How many times can you tell your story?
How many hangovers can you endure
Just to get some snuggling done?

You're living in a hormone dream
You don't have the slightest notion
What long-term love is all about
All your romantic liaisons
Don't deal with eternal questions like
"Who left the cap off the freaking toothpaste?"
"Whose turn to take the garbage out?"

Frail grasp on the big picture
You keep on rubbing and you're gonna get a blister
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
And I've seen it all before

And we pray to our Lord
Who we know is American
He reigns from on high
He speaks to us through middlemen
And he shepherds his flock
We sing out and we praise His name
He supports us in war
He presides over football games
And the right will prevail
All our troubles shall be resolved
We have faith above all
Unless there's money or sex involved

Frail grasp on the big picture (Nobody)
Nobody's calling and they're roughing up the kicker
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
Heaven help us
Frail grasp on the big picture
All waiting for that miracle elixir
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
I don't wonder anymore
Frail grasp on the big picture (Somebody)
You brought her here so go ahead and kiss her
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
Frail grasp on the big picture (Hold on, hold on)
Light fading and the fog is getting thicker
It's a frail grasp on the big picture

Frail grasp on the big picture
Frail grasp on the big picture

Sometimes you feel like you can't win
Sometimes you feel so isolated

Never thought I'd see you smile again

Look at the weather, look at the news
Look at all the people in denial
We're running time, leaving grace
Still we worship at the marketplace
While common sense is going out of style
I thought that I would be above it all by now
In some country garden in the shade

But it's business as usual
Day after day
Business as usual
Just grinding away
You try to be righteous
You try to do good
But business as usual
Turns your heart into wood

Monuments to arrogance reach for the sky
Our better nature's buried in the rubble
We got the prettiest White House that money can buy
Sitting up there in that beltway bubble
The main jefe talks about our freedom
But this is what he really means

Business as usual
How dirty we play
Business as usual
Don't you get in the way
Yeah, make you feel helpless
Make you feel like a clown
Business as usual
Is breaking me down

Boy, you can't go surfing in Century City
Yeah, them sharks out there are lurking beneath the curb
Yeah, they rob you blind, chew you up, and it ain't pretty
And it's a soul sucking, soul sucking, soul sucking, soul sucking
Soul sucking, soul sucking world

Business as usual
Day after day
Business as usual
Feel like walking away
A barrel of monkeys
Or band of renown
Business as usual
Is breaking me down

Somebody, somebody
You got a feelin' somebody's following you
Somebody, somebody

There's a jack-o-lantern moon in the midnight sky
Somebody going to live, somebody going to die
But down in the graveyard on that old tombstone
There's a big black crow and it's calling you home

Somebody, somebody
You got a feelin' somebody's following you
Somebody, somebody
You got a feelin' somebody's following you

Somebody

Now, what's the rush?
You listen here
No, you just hush
I know what you think
That man don't know anything
But I've been around a while
I know what's happening
Everybody want to check you out
Everybody want to be your friend
And all this pressure
Where do I fit in?
They don't know nothing you don't know
Ain't got nothing you ain't got
But you keep on running, you keep on running with the

Fast company, fast company
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast
Fast company, fast company
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast

Now it's alright
To have some fun
This is your turn
Your life has just begun
You're racing out the door
Don't have very much to say
Your motor's running hot
You can't wait to get away
Looking up the road ahead
You can't see very far
Remember where you come from
Remember who you are
Be careful what you say
Be careful who you trust
This world is beautiful
This world is dangerous

Fast company, fast company
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast
Fast company, fast company
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast

Talk to me and help me try to remember
How it feels to be so in doubt
Turn to me and help me try to remember
That raging fire that the years put out

Fast company, fast company
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast
Fast company, fast company
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast
Fast company, fast company
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast

You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast
Fast company, fast company
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast
Fast company, fast company
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast

[Song 90: All She Wants to Do Is Dance]
2 ContributorsAll She Wants to Do Is Dance LyricsThey're pickin' up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
Rebels been rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance
Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance
Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance
Wild-eyed pistol-wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat
Comin off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance

Well the government bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
To keep the boys from sellin'
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance
But that don't keep the boys
From makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout
They said, "Don't come back here, Yankee"
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money

'Cause all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
All she wants to do is dance

[Song 91: Center of the Universe]
2 ContributorsCenter of the Universe Lyrics
I come before you with my heart in my hand
Hoping you can see me through this veil of tears
Somehow I've got to make you understand
Ah, don't you know me after all these years?
Oh, love, I hate to disappoint you
But there's something you should know

This is not the center of the universe
That's alright with me
This is not the center of the universe
But it's where I want to be

I will be with you everywhere you go
In gentle breezes that caress your skin
And you will see me in the silent snow
In everything that comes around again
Oh, love, I'll always be beside you
Wherever you may roam
Someday, with all the stars to guide you
You will find your way back home

[Song 93: Sunset Grill]
1 ContributorSunset Grill LyricsLets go down to the Sunset Grill
We can watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
And stare out at the auburn sky
There's an old man there from the old world
To him, its all the same
Calls all his customers by name
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
You see a lot more meanness in the city
Its the kind that tears you up inside
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity
Hard to get home with any pride
These days a man makes you somethin'
And you never see his face
But there is no hiding place
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

Respectable little murders pay
They get more respectable every day
Dont worry girl, Im gonna stick by you
And someday soon were gonna get in that car and get outta here
Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
Watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
And gaze out at the auburn sky
Maybe well leave come springtime
Meanwhile, have another beer
What would we do without these jerks anyway?
Besides, all our friends are here
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

[Song 94: Last Good Time in Town]
3 ContributorsLast Good Time in Town Lyrics
I like to go out every now and then
I can't wait to do it again
But I haven't had the time
Lately
I like to step out every once in a while
I kind of like to do it in style
I haven't had the time
Lately

Lately I've been staying at home
(Staying at home, staying at home)
Working the crosswords, turn off the phone
(Turn off the phone, turn off the phone)

And I dream I'm on vacation
Because I like the way that sounds
It's a perfect occupation
For me
I don't mind being by myself
If there's no one else around
It's the last good time in town

Well, I could stand up straight, get a real job
Stay up late with the same old mob
But it hasn't crossed my mind
Lately
Put on a suit, work downtown
Then come up when the sun goes down
No, I haven't had the time
Lately

Lately I've been staying at home
(Staying at home, staying at home)
Working the crosswords, turn off the phone
(Turn off the phone, turn off the phone)

And I dream I'm on vacation
Because I like the way that sounds
It's a perfect occupation
For me
I don't mind being by myself
If there's no one else around
It's the last good time in town

Lately I've been staying at home
(Staying at home, staying at home)
Working the crosswords, turn off the phone
(Turn off the phone, turn off the phone)

And I dream I'm on vacation
Because I like the way that sounds
It's a perfect occupation
For me
I don't mind being by myself
If there's no one else around
It's the last good time in town

[Song 95: I Love to Watch a Woman Dance]
3 ContributorsI Love to Watch a Woman Dance Lyrics
I love to watch a woman dance
She bows her head and lifts her hands
Her hips begin to circle slowly
Her eyes have closed, her face is holy
She holds the whole room in trance

I love to watch a woman dance
Yeah, I love to watch a woman dance

She likes the slow songs of love lost
They take her a million miles away
Cause to dream, sometimes, that’s the only way
To go places you can't get to any other way
Our eyes connect, she takes my hand

I love to watch a woman dance
Yeah, I love to watch a woman dance

I feel my heart beating, and I wonder
Will it ever satisfy my longing?
I'm going to hold on to you for as long as I can
Cause who knows, this dance may be our only dance

So we dance together, close and slow
So slow we're almost standing still
Her warm breath against my neck
Slowly breaking down my will
The room spins so I can barely stand
The song ends and she lets go of my hand
There's so much I don't understand

I love to watch a woman dance
Yeah, I love to watch a woman dance

[Song 96: Guilty of the Crime]
3 ContributorsGuilty of the Crime Lyrics
You're the only one who's ever heard my song
I might be lonely now, but I won't be lonely long
Take a look at me, baby
Tell me, what do you see?
Take a look at me, baby
You're looking at the brand new me
I'm like a total stranger knocking at your door
No need to worry about the way I was before
It's a new love story
So read every line
You be the judge and the jury
I'm guilty of the crime

I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime
Of loving you, baby
Guilty of, guilty of the crime

I'm saving all my loving just for you
Because there's nothing more that I would rather do
It's a new love story
Got to read every line
You be the judge and the jury
I'm guilty of the crime

[Song 97: You Belong to the City]
1 ContributorYou Belong to the City LyricsThe sun goes down
The night rolls in
You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up
And the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowds through the midnight heat
The traffic roars
And the sirens scream
You look at the faces, its just like a dream
Nobody know where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been
'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your blood, its in your moves
You're a man of the street
When you said goodbye

You were on the run
Tryin' to get away from all the things you'd done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened, but nothing has changed
You still don't know where you're going
Your still just a face in the crowd
'Cause you belong to the city...
You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it
You're getting near it
You wanna make it
'Cause you can take it
You belong to the city

[Song 98: The Heart of the Matter [DVD]]
2 ContributorsThe Heart of the Matter  LyricsI got the call today, I didn’t wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old, true friend of ours was talkin’ on the phone
She said you’d found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside loves open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, Im learning again
Ive been tryin to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
Theres a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
The trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
Theyre the very things - we kill I guess
Pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesnt keep me warm
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
And the more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought Id figured out
I have to learn again
Ive been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me anymore
There are people in your life whove come and gone
They let you down you know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you baby; life goes on
You keep carryin that anger; itll eat you up inside, baby
Ive been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thought seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me
Ive been tryin to get down
To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So Im thinkin about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you dont love me
Forgiveness
Forgiveness - baby
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, you dont love me anymore

[Song 99: Hotel California (Orbitally Ambient Mix)]
2 ContributorsHotel California (Orbitally Ambient Mix) LyricsOn a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'this could be heaven or this could be hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say...
Welcome to the hotel california
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the hotel california
Any time of year, you can find it here
Her mind is tiffany-twisted, she got the mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the captain
'please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...

Welcome to the hotel california
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the hotel california
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
'relax,' said the night man
We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like
But you can never leave!

[Song 100: Eagles - Hotel California (2013 Remaster) (Türkçe Çeviri)]
1 ContributorEagles - Hotel California (2013 Remaster) (Türkçe Çeviri) LyricsKaranlık bir çöl yolunda
Saçım da soğuk bir rüzgar
Colitaların ılık kokusu
Gökyüzüne yükseliyor
Uzakta bir yerde
Parlak bir ışık gördüm
Kafam ağırlaştı ve görüşüm bulanıklaştı
Gece için durmam gerekti



Orda kapı yolunda duruyordu
Görev zilini duydum
Ve kendi kendime düşündüm

'Bu cennette olabilir, cehennem de'
Sonra kız bir mum yaktı
Ve bana yolu gösterdi
Koridorda sesler vardı
Sanırım şöyle dediklerini duydum



Hotel California'ya hoşgeldiniz
Çok sevimli bir yer (Çok sevimli bir yer)
Çok sevimli bir yüz
Hotel California'da çokça oda var
Senenin herhangi bir zamanı (senenin herhangi bir zamanı)
Burda bulabilirsin



Onun aklı mücеvherlerde
Onun Mеrcedes bends'i var
Arkadaş diye çağırdığı
Bir sürü tatlı erkek arkadaşları var
Sahne de nasıl dans ediyorlar
Tatlı yaz terinde
Bazı danslar hatırlanmak içindir
Bazı danslar unutmak



Kaptana seslendim
"Lütfen bana şarabımı getir"
"Biz de 1969'dan beri o içki yok" dedi
Ve hala o sesler çok uzaklardan çağırıyor
Seni gecenin ortasında uyandırır
Sadece şunu duyman için



Hotel California'ya hoşgeldiniz
Çok sevimli bir yer (Çok sevimli bir yer)
Çok sevimli bir yüz
Hotel California'da yaşıyorlar
Ne güzel bir süpriz (ne güzel bir süpriz)
Bahanelerinizi getirin



Tavan da aynalar
Buzda büyük pembe şampanya
Ve o dedi ki "Burada hepimiz sadece kendimizin tutsağız"
Ve ana salonda
Ziyafet için toplandılar
Onu çelik bıçaklarıyla doğradılar
Ama canavarı öldüremezler



Hatırladığım son şey
Kapıya koşutuğumdu
Daha önce olduğum yere giden
Geçidi tekrar bulmalıydım
"Sakinleş" dedi adam
Varmak için programlandık
"İstediğin zaman çıkış yapabilirsin
Ama asla ayrılamazsın"

[Song 101: New York Minute (2)]
2 ContributorsNew York Minute (2) LyricsHarry, got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning
He had a home
Love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess, it doesn't matter anymore
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Lying here in the darkness
I hear the sirens wail
Somebody, going to emergency
Somebody's going to jail
If you find somebody to love in this world
You better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get a little strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
In these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love
You better take a fool's advice
Take care of your own
'Cause one day they're here
Next day they're gone
Pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
Leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark
He said, "Baby, I've changed, please, come back"
What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
I know, the days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe, I believe, I believe

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get pretty change
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
In a New York minute, minute

Tryin' to decide what to do
Looks like my stop I don't wanna get off
I got myself hung up on you
Seems to me you don't want to talk about it
Seemed to me you just turn your pretty head and walk away
Places I've known things that I'm growin' and
Don't taste the same without you
Got myself in worst mess I've been
And I find myself startin' to doubt you
Comes a day talk all night here comes the morning
Come one night you just holdin' what we said and greet the day
I've got to cool myself down from stompin' around
Thinkin' some words 'cause I can't name ya
Guess it's okay got nothing to say
Still I don't suppose I can blame ya
Seems to me you don't wanna talk about it
Seemed to me you just turn your pretty hеad and walk away
Yeah walk away, walk away, walk away

There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

They say that anger is just love disappointed
They say that love is just a state of mind
But all this fighting over who will be anointed
Oh, how can people be so blind


Oh, they tell me there's a place over yonder
Cool water running through the burning sand
Until we learn to love one another
We will never reach the promise land

Go down, Bill Dalton, it must be God's will
Two brothers lyin' dead in Coffeyville
Two voices call to you from where they stood
Lay down your law books now, They're no damn good
Better keep on movin', Doolin-Dalton
'Til your shadow sets you free
If you're fast and if you're lucky
You will never see that hangin' tree
Well, the towns lay out across the dusty plains
Like graveyards filled with tombstones, waitin' for the names
And a man could use his back or use his brains
But some just went stir crazy, Lord, 'cause nothin' ever changed
'Til Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton
He was workin' cheap, just bidin' time
Then he laughed and said, "I'm goin'"
And so he left that peaceful life behind
Mm...

Oh, that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way
Oh, I did some damage, I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely, till I found you
You can go the distance
We'll find out in the long run (in the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one (is a strong one)
People talkin' about is
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down we will
Still come through
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run
You know I don't understand why you don't
Treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
'cause all thе debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you

Did you do it for lovе?
Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite?
Did you think you had to, honey?
Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out in the long run (in the long run)
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one (is a strong one)
Well, we're scared, but we ain't shakin'

Woman will you weep
How long, how long

Well I been doin' time in lonesome prison, where the sun don't shine
Just outside, the freedom river runs
Out there in that shiny night, with blood hounds on your mind
Don't you know it's the same sad situation?

Rock yourself to sleep
Everybody feels alright you know, I heard some poor fool say (Somebody-eeee)
Everyone is out there on the loose
Well I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name
But what you get is not quite what you choose
Tell me, how long, how long

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam

Well, I'm running down the road
Tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me
Two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine
Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
Drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand
And take it easy
Well, I'm a standing on a corner
In Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love
Is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy
Well I'm running down the road
Trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover
Who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
Make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe

Is gonna save me, oh oh oh
Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy

Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark?
Ahh-ah

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why

When we get crazy, it just ain't right (Try to keep your head, little girl)
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry, just hold on tight (Don't get caught in your little world)
'Cause I love you

Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

1 ContributorLife in the Fast Lane  Lyrics
He was a hard-headed man, he was brutally handsome, y'all
And she was terminally pretty
She held him up and he held her for ransom
In the heart of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, "Faster, faster, the lights are turnin' red"

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, huh

Eager for action, hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, huh
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh

Blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worst
She said, "Listen, baby, you can hear the engine's ring"
"We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddamn thing"
He said, "Call the doctor, I think I'm gonna crash"
"The doctor say he's comin', but you gotta pay in cash"
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around, and got lost
They didn't know, they were just dyin' to get off and it was

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh

Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane
