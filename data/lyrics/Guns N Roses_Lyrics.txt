She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
Ooh!

Oh, oh-oh-yeah
Woah, yeah

Ooh-ooh

Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
Mwah, I, I wanna watch you bleed

Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it, you're gonna bleed, but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl, who's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Oh, ah, I wanna hear you scream

*Moaning*

Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here everyday
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
Mwah, I'm gonna watch you bleed

And when you're high, you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down
Yeah, now



You know where you are?
You're in the jungle, baby
You're gonna die

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, oh my, my, my serpentine
Jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah

Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

(You're not the only one, you're not the only one)
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?

You'll feel better tomorrow, come the morning light now, baby

What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you men

Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars


D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said, "Peace could last forever"?
And in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no


Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't wanna hear no more

My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still, the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
And all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars


We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example, to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't need one more war
Ooh, I don't need one more war
No, no, no, no woah, no woah

What's so civil 'bout war anyway?

They come to our country and think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini-Iran or spread some fucking disease
They talk so many goddamn ways, it's all Greek to me
Well, some say I'm lazy, ooh, and others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy, I guess I'll always be

And honey, you can make my motor hum
Well, I got one chance left in a nine lives cat
I got a, a dog-eat-dog sly smile
I got a Molotov cocktail with a match to go
I smoke my cigarette with style
And I can tell you, honey

Wake up late, honey, put on your clothes
And take your credit card to the liquor store
Well, that's one for you and two for me by tonight

And nobody's home
You can fool yourself
You came in this world alone, alone

So nobody ever told you, baby
How it was gonna be?
What'll happen to you, baby?
Guess we'll have to wait and see
(One, two)

Old at heart, but I'm only twenty-eight
And I'm much too young to let love break my heart
Young at heart, but it's getting much too late
To find ourselves so far apart

I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately
And what more could you ask from me?
How could you say that I never needed you?
When you took everything
Said, you took everything from me
Hey, yeah

Young at heart, and it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out

Still, talkin' to myself
And nobody's home, alone

So nobody ever told us, baby
How it was gonna be
What'll happen to us, baby?
Guess we'll have to wait and see


When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way, find another day
With all the changin' seasons of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time
And now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
Back down on the ground
And you don't talk so loud
And you don't walk so proud
Anymore and what for?


Well, I jumped into the river
Too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own
And drifting all alone
If it doesn't show, give it time
To read between the lines

'Cause I see the storm is getting closer
And the waves, they get so high
Seems everything we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die?

I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through this time
Woah, this time
Without you

I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everything we've ever known's here

I get up around seven
Get outta bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothin', no
Because worrying's a waste of my time

Show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine

We've been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin', he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, oh, he won't leave me alone

I used to do a little, but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used to do a little, but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before

We've been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin', he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, oh, he won't leave me alone
Wow


Now I get up around whenever
I used to get up on time
But that old man, he's a real motherfucker
Gonna kick him on down the line

I used to do a little, but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used to do a little, but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' to get a little better
Said a little better than before

We've been dancin' with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin', he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, oh, he won't leave me alone, never
Oh, leave me alone

Stuck it in the bindle, and I shot it in the middle
And it, it drove me outta my mind
I shoulda known better, said I wish I never met her
Said I, I leave it all behind
Yowza

I'm a cold heartbreaker, fit to burn
And I'll rip your heart in two
And I'll leave you lyin' on the bed
I'll be out the door before you wake
It's nothin' new to you
'Cause I think we've seen that movie, too, aw

'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done
I said, you could be mine, aw

Now, holidays come and then they go
It's nothin' new today
Collect another memory
When I come home, late at night
Don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars, I'm home again
Ow

'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line (Aw)
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done
I said, you could be mine

You could be mine, you could be mine
You could be mine, you could be mine
You could be mine, mine, mine, mine
You've gone sketching too many times
Ooh, why don't you give it a rest?
Why must you find
Another reason to cry?


Well, you're breakin' down my back and I've been rackin' out my brain
It don't matter how we make it, 'cause it always ends the same
You can push it for more mileage, but your flaps are wearing thin
And I could sleep on it 'til mornin', but this nightmare never ends
Don't forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands
An' you can take the pity so far, but it's more than I can stand
'Cause this couch-trip's gettin' older, tell me, how long has it been?
'Cause five years is forever, and you haven't grown up yet

Oh, you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done
I bet you could be, you should be
You could be mine

Oh, you could be mine (You could be mine)
You could be mine (You could be mine)
Aw, you could be mine (You could be mine)
You could be mine (You could be mine)
Aw, you could be mine (You could be mine)
Aw, you could be mine (You could be mine)
Aw, you could be mine (You could be mine)
You could be mine, yeah

If we could see tomorrow, what of your plans?
No one can live in sorrow, ask all your friends
Times that you took in stride, they're back in demand
I was the one who was washing blood off your hands

Don't you cry tonight
I still love you, baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

I know the things you wanted, they're not what you have
With all the people talking, it's driving you mad
If I was standing by you, how would you feel
Knowing your love's decided and all love is real? Yeah, baby

Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight


I thought I could live in your world as years all went by
With all the voices I've heard, something has died
And when you're in need of someone, my heart won't deny you
So many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to, baby

And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
Baby, maybe someday
Don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight

And now, I don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye
But then, it seems that I had seen it in her eyes
Though it might not be wise, I'd still have to try
With all the love I have inside, I can't deny
I just can't let it die, 'cause her heart's just like mine
And she holds her pain inside
So, if you ask me why she wouldn't say goodbye
I know somewhere inside
There is a special light, still shining bright
And even on the darkest night, she can't deny

So, if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

No matter how I try, you say it's all a lie
So, what's the use of my confessions to a crime
Of passions that won't die
In my heart?

So, if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes


So, if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

So, now I don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye
It just might be that I had seen it in her eyes
And now, it seems that I gave up my ghost of pride
I'll never say goodbye

Well, well, well, you just can't tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle
Look out

Sowin’ all your wild oats in another's luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday, maybe Thursday you can sleep
But school starts much too early, and this hotel wasn't free
So party till your connection calls, honey, I'll return the key

Well, well, well, you just can't tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle
Well, well, well, you never can tell

Everyone needs love
You know that it's true
Someday you'll find someone that'll fall in love with you
But, oh, the time it takes
When you're all alone
Someday you'll find someone that you can call your own
But till then ya better!


Now you're clean and so discreet, I won't say a word
But most of all, this song is true, case you haven't heard
So c'mon and stop your cryin', we both know money burns
Honey, don't stop tryin', and you'll get what you deserve

I try and feel the sunshine, you bring the rain
You try and hold me down with your complaints
You cry and moan and complain, you whine and tear
Up to my neck in sorrow the touch you bring

You just don't step inside to, to fourteen years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say and you know
I've been the beggar, I've played the thief
I was the dog they all tried to beat

But it's been fourteen years of silence, ιt's been fourteen years of pain
It's been fourteen years that are gone forever and I'll never have again,  well

Your stupid girlfriends tell you, that I'm to blame
Well, they're all used up has-beens out of the game
This time I'll have the last word, you hear what I say?
I tried to see it your way, it won't work today

You just don't step inside to, to fourteen years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say, you know
I've been the dealer hangin' on your street
I was the dog they all tried to beat

But it's been fourteen years of silence, ιt's been 14 years of pain
It's been fourteen years that are gone forever and I'll never have again, well

Yeah, it's been nada

Bullshit and contemplation, gossip's their trade
If they knew half the real truth, what would they say?
Well I'm past the point of concern, it's time to play
These last four years of madness sure put me straight

You don't get back fourteen years in just one day
So hard to keep my own head, just go away, you know

Oh, I tried to see it your way, I tried to see it your way

Ever come back to this world again
Kinda like it in a coma 'cause no one's ever gonna
Oh, make me come back to this world again

I can't feel all the pressure, and I like it this way
But my body's calling, my body's calling:
"Won't you come back to this world again?"
Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end, I've got the bones on the mast
Well, I've gone sailing, I've gone sailing
I could leave so easily, my friends are calling back to me
I said, they're, they're leavin' it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity, and
Someone to tell me what the fuck is goin' on
Goddamn it

Slipping farther and farther away
It's a miracle how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit

Help me
"Okay, let's get this guy in the program please, we're losing him." "Start an IV Please."
Help Me
"Come on... His airways.. someone's got to protect his airways. I want two..."
"Where's the defibrillator?"
"Two IV's over here, please. That's two more now. We're losing him"
"Let's go"
Help Me
"Slow-motion here. This guy's going..."
Bastard
"Let's get him in ER"
"...Going out on us"
"Who's got the defibrillator?"

Please understand me

I'm climbing through the wreckage of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation just can't stifle all my screams
And I'm waiting at the crossroads, waiting for you
Waiting for you, where are you?

No one's going to bother me anymore
No one's going to mess with my head no more
I can't understand what all the fighting's for
But it's so nice here, down off the shore
I wish you could see this, 'cause there's nothing to see
It's peaceful here and it's fine with me
Not like the world where I used to live
I never really wanted to live, ah

I know
"Okay, we're starting to lose this guy. I want that IV and his airway protected!"
"Let's get some people in here!"
"Get the crash cart please, we're losing this guy. He's going..." "Give me an airway please"
"... Going under."
"Clear"
Zap him again
"How about an IV, stat?"
"Okay... you better protect the airway, you're starting to lose him." "clear!"
Zap the son of a bitch again


"Listen to me"
"Axl, are you listening to me?"
"Don't walk away from me!"
'You are such a fucking prick, I am so pissed with you"
"Get back over here!"
"All I hear is bullshit, all the time"
"All you ever wanna do is have sex, sex sex"
"I just don't give a shit anymore"
"I love you"

You live your life like it's a coma, won't you tell me why we'd wanna?
With all the reasons you give, it's, it's kinda hard to believe
But who am I to tell you that I've seen any reason why you should stay?
Maybe we'd be better off without you, anyway
You got a one-way ticket, on your last chance ride
Got a one-way ticket to your suicide
Got a one-way ticket, and there's no way out alive
An' all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is, then there's stories to be told
No, you don't need a doctor, no one else can heal your soul
Got your mind in submission, got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger, they just stepped aside
They be down by the water while you watch 'em waving goodbye
They be calling in the morning, they be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer, but you know nobody's home
When the bell's stopped ringing it was nobody's fault, but your own
There were always ample warnings, there were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it comin' but we gave you too much time
And when you said that no one's listening, why'd your best friend drop a dime?
Sometimes, we get so tired of waiting for a way to spend our time
An' it's so easy to be social, it's so easy to be cool
Yeah, it's easy to be hungry, when you ain't got shit to lose
And I wish that I could help you with what you hope to find
But I'm still out here, waiting, watching reruns of my life
When you reach the point of breaking, know it's gonna take some time
To heal the broken memories that another man would need just to survive

Watch my disenchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong
They've seen the end and you can't hold on, now

'Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To end the fascination
Even with an iron fist
More than you got, to rule the nation
When all I've got is precious time

No, it don't really matter (Matter, matter)

You think you got it all locked up inside
And if you beat 'em enough, they'll die
It's like a walk in the park from a cell
(It don't really matter)
Now you're keeping your own kind in hell

While their arms reach out for your help
And you're out of time

Dizzy little dreamer with your head down in the stars
Fucking little schemer lost yourself inside the art

Parasitic demon sucking acid through your heart

Absurd

No one ever told me when I was alone

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better

The hardest part this troubled heart has never yet been through, now
Was to heal the scars that got their start inside someone like you, now
Boy, had I known or I'd been shown back when how long it'd take me
To break the charms that brought me harm and all but would erase me
I never would hope that I could, no matter what you'd pay me
Replay the part, you stole my heart, I should've known you're crazy
If all I knew was, that with you, I'd want someone to save me
It'd be enough, but just my luck, I fell in love and maybe

All that I wanted was

Now I know you better
You know I know better
Now I know you better

So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution
This melody inside of me still searches for solution
A twist of fate, the change of heart cures my infatuation
And a broken heart, to provide the spark for my determination

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better

All that I wanted was

Now I know you better
You know I know better
Now I know you better


I never wanted you to be so full of anger
I never wanted you to be somebody else
I never wanted you to be someone afraid to know themselves
I only wanted you to see things for yourself

All that I wanted was

Now I know you better
Now we all know better

All that I wanted was


Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

If I were you, I'd manage to avoid the invitation
Of promised love that can't keep up with your adoration
Just use your head and in the end, you'll find your inspiration
To choose your steps and won't regret this kind of aggravation

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better

Bleached blond hair, collagen lip injections
Who are you to criticize my intentions?
Got your subtle, manipulative devices
Just like you, I got my vices
I got a thought that would be nice
I'd like to crush your head, tight in my vice
Pain

And that goes for all you punks in the press, that want to start shit by printing lies instead of the things we said
That means you, Andy Secher at Hit Parader, Circus magazine, Mick Wall at Kerrang!
Bob Guccione Jr. at Spin, what you pissed off 'cause your dad gets more pussy than you?
Fuck you, suck my fucking dick
You be ripping off the fucking kids while they be paying their hard-earned money to read about the bands they want to know about?
Printing lies, starting controversy, you want to antagonize me?
Antagonize me, motherfucker, get in the ring, motherfucker and I'll kick your bitchy little ass, punk


I don't like you, I just hate you
I'm gonna kick your ass
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, ouh
Ahahahaha
Ahahahaha
Ahahahaha

You may not like our integrity, yeah
We built a world out of anarchy, oh yeah

And in this corner, weighing
In at 850 pounds, Guns N' Roses!
Get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring
Get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring (get the fuck in!)
Get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring
Get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring
Yeah

:
This song is dedicated to all the Guns N' Fuckin' Roses fans
Who've stuck with us through all the fucking shit
And to all those opposed - hmm, well...
:
Get in the ring, get in the ring...

Been hidin' out and layin' low
It's nothin' new to me
Well, you can always find a place to go
If you can keep your sanity

They break down the doors and they rape my rights, but
They won't touch me
They scream and yell, and fight all night
You can't tell me
I lose my head, I close my eyes
They won't touch me
'Cause I got somethin' I been buildin' up inside
For so fuckin' long

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm fuckin' innocent
They won't break me

Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'
Sometimes it's harder to leave
And every time you think you know just what you're doin'
That's when your troubles exceed

They push me in a corner just to get me to fight, but
They won't touch me
They preach and yell, and fight all night
You can't tell me
I lose my head, I close my eyes
They won't touch me
'Cause I got somethin' I been buildin' up inside
I'm already gone

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
'Cause I'm innocent
They won't break me

No
No-woah-woah
No-oh
No-no-no
No-no-no
No-oh, woah
No-oh-oh
No-no-no
Lemme see ya try


Some people got a chip on their shoulder
And some would say it was me
But I didn't buy that fifth of whiskey that you gave me
So I'd be quick to disagree

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm fuckin' innocent
They won't break me
They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
'Cause I'm innocent
So you can suck me
Take that one to heart

[Song 29: Hard Skool]
18 ContributorsHard Skool Lyrics
All cautions made, every chance was given
No effort spared to save what we had
All in good faith I would not hesitate
To extend myself and lend you my hand

But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway

As tempers fade and lies forgiven
No cause embraced could break what we had
In its place a storm is liftin'
I would've thought you could be more of a man

But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway


Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy

But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
Had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
Had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway

Ain't it fun when you're always on the run?
Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you've become?
Ain't it fun when you get so high, well, that you, you just can't cum?
Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young?
It's such fun

Good fun, such fun, such fun, ah
Yeah fun, such fun, such fun, ah
Yeah, fun, such fun, such
Ow

Ain't it fun when you're taking care of number one?
Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun?
Ain't it fun when you - just - can't seem to find your tongue?
'Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung
It's such fun

Well, somebody come up to me, and spit right in my face
I didn't even feel it, it was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glass
I didn't even feel it, it happened so fast

Such fun, such fun, such fun
Such fun, such fun, such fun, fun
Such fun, such fun, such fun, yeah
Such fun, such fun, such

Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt?
Ain't it fun when she splits and leaves you on the bum?
Well, ain't it fun when you've broken up every band that you've ever begun?
Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young?
It's such fun (yeah)

We all come in from the cold, we come down from the wire
An' everybody warms themselves to a different fire
An' sometimes we get burned, you'd think sometime we'd learn
The one you love is the one that should take you higher
You ain't got no one, you better go back out and find 'em

Just like children hidin' in a closet, can't tell what's goin' on outside
Sometimes, we're so far off the beaten track, we get taken for a ride
By a parlor trick, or some words of wit, a hidden hand up a sleeve
To think the one you love could hurt you now is a little hard to believe
But everybody, darlin', sometimes bites the hand that feeds

When I look around an' everybody always brings me down
Well, is it them or me? Well, I just can't see but there ain't no peace to found
But if someone really cared, well, they'd take the time to spare
A moment to try and understand another one's despair
Remember, in this game we call life, that no one said it's fair

Breakdown (Let me hear it now)
Breakdown (Let me hear it now, yeah)
Breakdown (Let me hear it now)


I've come to know the cold, I think of it as home
When there ain't enough of me to go around, I'd rather be left alone
But if I call you out of habit, I'm out of love and I gotta have it
Would you give it to me if I fit your needs? Like when we both knew we had it
Now, the damage's done and we're back out on the run
Funny how everything was roses when we held on to the guns
Just because you're winnin' don't mean you're the lucky one

Breakdown (Let me hear it now)
Breakdown (Yeah)
Breakdown (Let me hear it now)

There goes the Challenger, bein' chased by the blue, blue meanies on wheels
The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver
The last American hero, the-the electric sitar
The demi-god, the super driver of the golden west
Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind the beautiful, lone driver
The police cars are getting closer, closer
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile
Yeah, baby, they about to strike
They gonna get him, smash, rape
The last beautiful free soul on this planet

But it is written
If the evil spirit arms the tiger with claws
Brahman provided wings for the dove
Thus spake the super guru
D'you hear that?

Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness
Yeah, I'll find a way to cure the pain
If I said that you're my friend and our love would never end
How long before I had your trust again?
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Hoping that you'd find your own way in
But how can I protect you, or try not to neglect you
When you won't take the love I have to give?

Yeah, I bought me an illusion and I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams and I had to have them all
But, oh, the taste is never so sweet as what you'd believe it is
Well, I guess it never is, it's these prejudiced illusions
That pump the blood to the heart of the biz


You know, I never thought that it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah, I let you shape me, but I feel as though you raped me
'Cause you climbed inside my world and in my song
So now I've closed the door to keep the cold outside
Seems, somehow, I've found the will to live
But how can I forget you, or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive? Yeah, yeah

Sweetness is a virtue and you lost your virtue long ago
You know I'd like to hurt you but my conscience always tells me "No"
You could sell your body on the street to anyone whom you might meet
Who'd love to try and get inside and bust your innocence open wide

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no


Gonna have some fun with my frustration
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour 'cause this road ain't  getting clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again
"Better tame that boy, 'cause he's a wild one
Better tame that boy 'fore he's a man"
Sweetheart, don't make me laugh, you's getting too big for your pants
And I think maybe you should cut out while you can

You can use your illusion, let it take you where it may
We live and learn, and then, sometimes, it's best to walk away
Me, I'm just here hanging on, it's my only place to stay
At least for now, anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions just to throw them all away


I'm taking time for quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy, so why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say?
Callin' off the dogs, a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you, I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page?

Kindness is a treasure and it's one, towards me, you've seldom shown
So, I'll say it, for good measure, to all the ones like you, I've known;
Ya know I'd like to shave your head and all my friends could paint it red
'Cause love to me is a two-way street, an' all I really want is peace

But my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no


Affection is a blessing, can you find it in your sordid heart?
I tried to keep this thing together but the tremor tore my pad apart
Yeah, I know, it's hard to face when all we've worked for's gone to waste
But you're such a stupid woman and I'm such a stupid man
But love, like time, 's got its own plans

But my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no
Yeah, if love is blind, I guess I'll buy myself a cane


Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange

Yesterday, there was so many things I was never told
Now that I'm starting to learn, I feel I'm growing old
'Cause yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Time just fades the pages in my book of memories
Prayers in my pocket, and no hand in destiny
I'll keep on movin' along with no time to plant my feet
'Cause yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Some things could be better if we'd all just let them be

Ooh, yesterday's got nothing for me
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Got nothing for me, ooh, yeah


Yesterday, there were so many things I was never shown
Suddenly, this time I found I'm on the streets and I'm all alone
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
I ain't got time to reminisce old novelties

Ooh, yesterday's got nothing for me
Yesterday's, ooh, got nothing for me
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Yesterday

[Song 34: There Was a Time]
21 ContributorsThere Was a Time LyricsAn incredibly layered and complex song by Guns N' Roses, “There Was a Time” features a mellotron, violins, choirs and multiple synthesizers.
Ooh, broken glass and cigarettes, writin' on the wall
It was a bargain for the summer and I thought I had it all
I was the one who gave you everything, the one who took the fall
You were the one who would do anything, one who can't recall
Where she was while she was sleepin' in another woman's bed
Or the doctor's, or the lawyer's, or a stranger that she met
If there's nothin' I can gain from this or anything at all
It'd be the knowledge that you gave me when I thought I'd heard it all

It was a long time for you (It was a long time)
It was a long time for me (It was a long time)
It'd be a long time for anyone but (It was a long time)
Looks like it's meant to be

Social class and registers, cocaine in the hall
All the way from California on the way to your next call
To those non-negotiations to simulate a cause
For the betterment of evils and your ways around the laws
That keep you up and sitting pretty on a pedestal or bed
And now you're sleepin' like an angel, never mind who you gave head
If there's somethin' I can make of this or anything at all
It'd be the devil hates a loser and you thought you had it all

It was a wrong time for you (It was a wrong time)
It was a wrong time for me (It was a wrong time)
It was the wrong time for everyone, but (It was the wrong time)
Looks like I got to see for myself

If I could go back in time to the place in my soul
There, all alone
Lonely teardrops, ooh, are callin' you
But I don't want to know it, now
'Cause knowin' you, it won't change a damn thing
But there was a time


Yeah, there was a time, I didn't wanna know at all
Didn't wanna know at all and I don't wanna know it now
Yeah, there was a time, didn't wanna know at all
Didn't wanna know at all and I don't wanna know it now (Oh)
Oh, I would do anything for you
There was a time
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
There was a time


There was a time
I would do anything for you
Ooh-oh, I would do anything for you
(Yeah, there was a time, didn't wanna know at all)
(Didn't wanna know at all and I don't wanna know it now)
Oh, I would do anything for you

Just to be a man who stands on his own
But the book always burns as the story takes its turn
And leaves a broken man

How could she be so cool? Ah
How could she be so fine?
I owe a favor to a friend
My friends, they always come through for me

It's a story of a man who works as hard as he can
Just to be a man who stands on his own
But the book always burns as the story takes its turn
And leaves a broken man
If you could only live my life you could see the difference
You make to me, to me

And I'd look right up at night
And all I'd see was darkness
Now, I see the stars, alright
I want to reach right up and grab one for you
When the lights went down in your house
Yeah, that made me happy
The sweat I make for you
Yeah, I think you know where that comes from
Guitar, come on


Yeah, when I look right up at night

Everybody's gone to the garden
As you look into the trees, you can look, but you don't see
Flowers seem to tease you at the garden
Everybody's there, but you don't seem to care
What's it with you man, and this garden? Yeah
Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy man's utopia
If you're lost, no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Only poor boys take a chance
On the garden's song and dance
Feel her flowers, as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without


You can find it all inside, no need to wrestle with your pride
No, you ain't losing your mind, you're just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside for the garden

I wasn't really scared
Lost my virginity there
To a gypsy with blond hair
But now no one seems to care
Like a mouse inside a maze
Wandering 'round for daze
With a smile upon my face
I never want to leave this place
Only poor boys take a chance
On this garden song and dance
Feel her flowers, as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
Turned into my worst phobia
It's a crazy man's utopia
If you're lost no one can show you
But it sure was glad to know you

Sometimes, these things, they are so easy
Sometimes, these things, they are so cold
Sometimes, these things just seem to rip you right in two
Oh no, man, don't let 'em get to you
Oh yeah, ow, yeah

She loved him yesterday
He laid her sister, she said, "Okay, that's alright"
Buried her things today
Way back out, deep behind the driveway and that's alright

Sometimes, these women are so easy
Sometimes, these women are so cold
Sometimes, these women seem to rip you right in two
Only if you let 'em get to you
Oh, oh yeah

Get out on your own
And you take all that you own
And you forget about your home
And then you're just fucking gone


There's no logic here, today
Do as you got to, go your own way, I said, that's right
Time's short, your life's your own
And in the end, we are just

Dust an' bones

To understand this life that we're all going through
"Then when she said she was going to, like, wreck my car
I didn't know what to do"

Oh, sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
And I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny, but you'd think, by now, I'd be smiling
I guess some things never change
Oh, never change

I met an old cowboy, I saw the look in his eyes
Something tells me he's been here before 'cause experience makes you wise
I was only a small child when the thought first came to me
That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son that brought back the devil in me

Oh, but sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny, but you'd think, by now, I'd be smiling
Yeah, I guess some things never change
Ooh, never change

I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul
Still wet behind the ears
I've been around this track a couple of times
But now the dust is starting to clear, oh, yeah


Sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny, but you'd think, by now, I'd be smiling

(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Oh, oh-oh

When all is said and done, we're not the only ones
Who look at life this way, that's what the old folks say
But every time I'd see them makes me wish I had a gun (Ah-ah)
If I thought that I was crazy, well, I guess I'd have more fun
Guess I'd have more fun

La, la, la
La-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Ooh, the Catcher in the Rye again
Ooh, won't let you get away from him
It's just another day like today (Ah-ah, ah) (Oh-woah-woah)

You decide 'cause I don't have to (Ah-ah)
Then they'll find and I won't ask you (Ah-ah)
At any time or long hereafter (Ah-ah)
If the cold outside's as I'm imagining (Ah-ah)
It to be
Oh, oh


La, la-la-la, la, la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la, la-la


La, la-la
La-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

Ooh, the Catcher in the Rye again
Ooh, won't let you get away from him (Woah-oh-oh)
It's just another day like today

When all is said and done, we're not the only ones (Ah-ah)
Who look at life this way, that's what the young folks say (Ooh, oh, ooh)
As if they'd ever change as that were mine to say (Ooh, oh, ooh)
But every time I'd see them makes me wish I had a gun (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
If I thought that I was crazy, well, I guess I'd have more fun (Ah-ah)
'Cause what used to be's not there for me
And ought to for someone that belonged
Insane, like I do

(La, la-la-la, la, la, la-la) Oh, no, oh-oh

(La-la-la, la-la, la-la) Oh, na, na-na, na-na

On an ordinary day, not in an ordinary way
All at once, the song I heard, no longer would it play
For anybody or anyone
That needed comfort from somebody
Needed comfort from someone
Who cared to be not like you and unlike me
And then the voices went away from me
Somehow, you set the wheels in motion, now haunts our memories
You were the instrument, you were the one
How a body, took a body, you gave that boy a gun
Took our innocence beyond our stares
Sometimes, the only thing we counted on when no one else was there
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
Na-na, na-na, na-na

All the love in the world couldn't save you
All the innocence inside
You know, I tried so hard to make you, ooh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, to make you change your mind
And it hurts too much to see you
And how you left yourself behind
You know I wouldn't want to be you
Now there's a hell I can't describe

So now I wander through my days
And try to find my ways
To the feelings that I felt
I saved for you and no one else
And though as long as this road seems
I know it's called the street of dreams
But that's not stardust on my feet
It leaves a taste that's bittersweet
That's called the blues, ooh

I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I'd go, I see you
Though it's what you planned
This much is true, ah-oh
What I thought was beautiful
Don't live inside of you, anymore


I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I'd go, I see you
Though it's what you planned
This much is true, ah-oh
What I thought was beautiful
Don't live inside of you, anymore
Oh-oh-oh

What this means to me is more than I know you believe
What I thought of you, now, has cost more than it should for me
What I thought was true before, were lies I couldn't see
What I thought was beautiful, is only memories
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
"What'd I tell you?"
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
That's what they'll tell ya

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yay

Don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been and I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me

Be it a song or a casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations
Your words, once heard, they can place you in a faction
My words may disturb, but at least there's a reaction
Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah
Sometimes I wanna kill, sometimes I wanna die
Sometimes I wanna destroy, sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I could get even, sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give, sometimes I never give a fuck

It's only for a while, I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen, didn't want to be a man
So I hid inside my world, I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely, I fell down when I was blind

So, don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been and I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me

How can I ever satisfy you?
And how can I ever make you see that
Deep inside, we're all somebody
And it don't matter who you, you wanna be?

But now I gotta smile, I hope you comprehend
For, this man can say it happened 'cause this child has been condemned
So I stepped into your world, I kicked you in the mind
And I'm the only witness to the nature of my crime

But look at what we've done to the innocent and young
Whoa, listen to who's talking 'cause we're not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes and dumped into the brain
Said, it tears into our conscious thoughts, you tell me, who's to blame?

I know you don't wanna hear me cryin'
And I know you don't wanna hear me deny
That your satisfaction lies in your illusion
But your delusions are yours, and not mine
We take for granted, we know the whole story
We judge a book by its cover and read what we want
Between selected lines

Don't hail me and don't idolize the ink
Or I've failed in my intentions, can you find the missing link?
Your only validation is living your own life
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time

So I send this song to the offended
I said what I meant and I've never pretended
As so many others do, intending just to please
If I damned your point of view, could you turn the other cheek?


Oh
Don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I've been and I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me

Don't damn me
I said, don't damn me
I said, don't hail me
Ah, don't damn me
Ouh

Smoke 'em if you got 'em
Alright, that sucked

Can anybody tell me why the pain
It just won't stop?

This pain, it just won't stop

My only regret
Is that I never took the time to forget
All those unspoken feelings
That were never spared

Don't know what to tell you now

[Song 46: Garden of Eden]
24 ContributorsGarden of Eden Lyrics
It's a critical solution, and the east coast got the blues
It's a mass of confusion, like the lies they sell to you

You got a glass-jawed toothache of a mental disease
And they be running 'round back, see them line up on their knees
'Cause the kiss-ass sycophants, throwing penance at your feet
When they got nowhere to go, watch them come in off the streets
While they're banging out front inside they're slamming to the crunch
Go on an throw me to the lions and the whole damn screaming bunch
'Cause the pissed-off rip-offs, they're everywhere you turn
Tell me how a generation's ever supposed to learn

This fire is burning, and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop, it's rock n' roll

I read it on a wall, it went straight to my head
It said, "Dance to the tension of a world on edge"
We got racial violence, and who'll cast the first stone?
And sex is used any way it can be
Sometimes, when I look out, it's hard to see the day
It's a feeling, you can have it, it's not mine to take away

Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden
And there's no one who's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the Garden of Eden

This fire is burning, and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop, it's rock n' roll
Suck on that

Looking through this point of view, there's no way I'm gonna fit in
Don't you tell me what my eyes see, don't you tell me who to believe in
I ain't superstitious, but I know when something's wrong
I've been dragging my heels with a bitch called hope
Let the undercurrent drag me along

Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden
And there's no one who's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the Garden of Eden, come on

Oh yeah

Most organized religions make a mockery of humanity
Our governments are dangerous and out of control
The Garden of Eden is just another graveyard
Said, if they had someone to buy it, said I'm sure they'd sell my soul

This fire is burning, and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop, it's rock n' roll

Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden
(And we ain't talkin' about no poison apple
Or some missin' rib, ya hear?)
Said, there's no one who's gonna believe this
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden

This fire is burning, and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop, it's rock n' roll

The perils of rock n' roll decadence

I know this chick, she lives down on Melrose
She ain't satisfied without some pain
Ooh, Friday night is going up inside her again
Well, crack the whip, 'cause that bitch is just insane
(I'm serious)

She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
She's pretty tied up and you can ride her
She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
Oh, I can't tell you she's the right one
Oh no, oh no, oh no

Once there was this rock and roll band rolling on the streets
Time went by and it became a joke
We just needed more and more fulfilling, uh-huh
Time went by and it all went up in smoke
(But check it out)

She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
She's pretty tied up and you can ride her
She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
Oh, I can't tell you she's the right one
Oh no, oh no, oh no


Once you made that money, it costs more now
It might cost a lot more than you'd think
I just found a million dollars that someone forgot
It's days like this that push me over the brink
(Cool Ranch dressing)

She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
She's pretty tied up and you can ride her
She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
I can't tell you she's the right one

Oh, she's the right one
She's the right one
I can't tell you she's the right one
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh, she's the right one
She's the right one, she's the right one
Oh no, woah, woah, woah

You don't know why I won't act the way you think I should
You thought they'd make me behave and submit, submit
What were you thinking?
'Cause I don't forget
You don't know why I won't give in
Hell with the pressure, I'm not caving in
You know that I got under your skin
You sold your soul but I won't let you win
You talk too much, you say I do
Difference is nobody cares about you

You've got all the answers, you know everything
Why nobody asked you is a mystery to me

I'm sorry for you, not sorry for me
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe
I'm sorry for you, not sorry for me
You don't know who you can trust now or you should believe
You should believe
You don't know who you can trust now or you should believe


You close your eyes, all well and good
I'll kick your ass like I said that I would
You tell them stories they'd rather believe
Use and confuse them, they're numb and naive
Truth is the truth hurts, don't you agree?
It's harder to live with the truth about you
Than to live with the lies about me

Nobody owes you not one god damn thing
You know where to put your, "Just shut up and sing"

I'm sorry for you, not sorry for me
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe
I'm sorry for you, not sorry for me
You chose to hurt those that love you and won't set them free
Won't set them free
You chose to hurt those that love you and won't set them free

You don't need anyone else to be sorry for you
You've got no heart
You can't see all that you've done for me
I know the reasons you tear me apart

You better back off, back off, bitch

Another empty house, another dead-end street
Gonna rest my bones, sit for a spell
This side of heaven is close to hell

Right next door to hell
Why don't you write a letter to me?
I said I'm right next door to hell
And so many eyes are on me
Right next door to hell
Got nowhere else to be
Right next door to hell
Feels like the walls are closin' in on me

My mama never really said much to me
She was much too young and scared to be
Hell, Freud might say that's what I need
But all I really ever get is greed
And most my friends, they feel the same
Hell, we don't even have ourselves to blame
But times are hard and thrills are cheaper
As your arms get shorter, your pockets get deeper

Right next door to hell
Why don't you write a letter to me?
'Cause I'm right next door to hell
And so many eyes are on me
Right next door to hell
I never thought this is where I'd be
But I'm right next door to hell
Thinkin' time will stand still for me

Fuck you

Not bad kids, just stupid ones, yeah
Thought we'd own the world an' getting used was havin' fun
I said we're not sad kids, but lucid ones, yeah
Flowin' through life, not collecting anyone

It drove me up the wall and drove me out of my mind

Oh

Kickin' back in the shadow
Got no need for the light
Who's sorry now, old-timer?
Look at how you've spent your life
Scrounging for change to put some money in your pocket
My, how scratch does burn
Laughing at the suckers as you pissed it away
But I got the time, even I got the muscle
I got the need to lay it all on the line
I ain't afraid of your smokescreen hustle

It's a perfect crime
Goddammit, it's a perfect crime
Motherfucker, it's a perfect crime
I said it's perfect

Keep the demons down and drag the skeletons out
I got a blind man following me in chains
I said, he's fun to watch when the world has stopped
And I think he's got something to say

You wanna fuck with me?
Don't fuck with me
'Cause I'm what you'll be
So don't fuck with me
If you had a better sense
You'd just step aside from the bad side of me
Don't fuck with the bad side of me
Stay away from the bad side of me
Don't fuck with the bad side

(T minus 1:09 and counting)
Ostracized, but that's alright
I was thinking about something myself
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight


Call on everybody who's got last rites
Said it's better if you locked them away
Running through the visions at the speed of light
Won't you let me be?
Motherfucker, just let me be
Goddammit, better let me be
Don't you know you better let me, aah

Perfect crime
Goddammit, it's a perfect crime
Motherfucker, it's a perfect crime
Don't you know, it's a perfect crime?

Ooh, and left so far out from the shore
Oh, that I can't find my way back, my way anymore, no

Forgive them that tear down my soul
And bless them that they might grow old
And free them so that they may know
That it's never too late
For the many times, what seemed like a memory
I searched and found the ways you used to lure me in
Oh, I found the ways
Ooh, why it had to be mired in denial, and so afraid

That we have the strength to choose
Oh, freedom, or the chains
We have together

But ya haven't seen the worst yet

Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
I had a woman who had said it was all alright
Now I'm back, the only one

And I ain't standin'
Never standin' in the shadow of your love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shadow of your love
Oh no

Stole my changes helplessly
I said yeah, but I got no regrets
Money, it was on the table
So I booked with all the bets
Livin' like you're livin' ain't so hot
And you ain't my idea
Of a high-rollin' shot

So I ain't standin'
I'm never standin' in the shadow of your love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shadow of your love
Oh no
Mh


High-price callin', hangin' over your head
I hope you've heard, baby, all I've said
You've gone cold or even misread
No use cryin', you're as good as dead

Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
I had a woman who had said it was all alright
Now I'm back, the only one

And I ain't standin'
Never standin' in the shadow of your love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Shadow, shadow
Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Oh no

Diamonds and fast cars, money to burn
I got my head in the clouds, I got these thoughts to churn
Got my feet in the sand, I got a house on the hill
I got a headache like a mother twice the price of my thrills

And it's a cold day in the continental drift
I said this traffic is hell, can you give me a lift?
And I'll try to paint a story, got your pictures to tell
Yeah, you got to make a livin' with what you bring yourself to sell

I got some genuine, imitation bad apples
Free sample for your peace of mind, only $9.95

I got my camera back from customs, got my law fees up to date
Hell, they must've seen me comin', ain't this life so fuckin' great?

When the shit hit the fan, it was all I could stand, yeah
Well, I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathin' while it can but what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter
If I could touch the sky, well, I would float on by
While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy
If it were up to me, I'd say, just leave me be
Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch?

Gold and caviar
Now, won't you pour my apathy?
I'd have all the bases covered
If I could teach my hands to see

Now, we're down in the deep end where they'd love to watch you drown
I said, your laundry could use washing, we'll hang it up all over town
I said, Hollywood's like a dryer an' we're down on Sunset Strip
An' you'll be suckin' down the Clorox 'til your life's all nice and crisp

When the shit hits the fan, it was all I could stand, yeah
I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathin' while it can but what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter
If I could touch the sky, I would float on by
While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy
If it were up to me, I'd say, just leave me be
Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch?


When the shit hits the fan, it was all I could stand, yeah
I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathin' while it can but what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter
If I could touch the sky, I would float on by
While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy

Why let that one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch?

I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I said, I don't know what I did, but I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I can't wait here forever, I got too much here to lose

An' now you are blowing smoke, I think you're one big joke
Me? I got to lot to learn an' I am still waiting for the heads to turn
You say I walk a line, fuck, they move it every time
You walk a mile in my shoes and then you tell me 'bout singin' the blues
Ah, well, you get what you pay for and freedom's real high priced
And while your ripping off childrens, somebody's fuckin' your wife
It's never made a difference, it's only how you survive

I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I said, I don't know what I did, but I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I can't wait here forever, I got too much here to lose

An' now you ask me why, I said, "It's do or die"
I'll stick it right in your face and then I'll put you in your motherfuckin' place
And you, you can suck my ass an' I think it is so low class
Me? I'm just so concerned, I'm still waitin' for your ass to burn
Oh, you want a confrontation? I'll give you every fuckin' chance
With your verbal masturbation, me? I just like to dance
How's that for provocation? I'm just making a stance

And I'm tired of the frustration of living inside of your lies
And I am wired on indignation, I said, somebody's got to die
Oh


I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I said, I don't know what I did, but I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I can't wait here forever, I got too much here to lose
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
Listen motherfucker, you're about to pay your dues
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
If you're goin' up against me then you know you're gonna lose

You think anyone with an I.Q. over 15
Would believe your shit, fuckhead?
Nothing but a fucking pussy

[Song 58: Nice Boys]
19 ContributorsNice Boys Lyrics
She hit town like a rose in bloom
Smelling sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried

In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big, you know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home

I said, "Nice boys don't play rock and roll"
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy

Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price laying flat on her back

Wanted so bad just to please the boys
They ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made

You know, nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy and I never was


Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get her ass around
But now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with a flick and a spoon

And in the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
You know the roaches so big, you know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home

Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll

Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Na, na, na na, na, na, baby
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'll bet your mamma said
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys

One, two
One, two

All I need is some inspiration
Before I do somebody some harm
I feel just like a vegetable
Down here on the farm
Nobody comes to see me
Nobody here to turn me on
I ain't even got a lover
Down here on the farm

They told me to get healthy
They told me to get some sun
But boredom eats me like cancer
Down here on the farm
Drinkin' lemonade shandy
Ain't nobody here to do me harm
For I'm like a fish out of water
Down here on the farm


I wrote a thousand letters
Till my fingers all gone numb
But I never see no postman
Down here on the farm
I call my baby on the telephone, I say
"Come down and have some fun"
But she knows what the score is
Down here on the farm

I can't fall in love with a wheat field
I can't fall in love with a barn
When everything smells like horse shit
Down here on the farm
Blue skies and swimming pools
Add so much charm
But I'd rather be back in Soho
Than down here on the farm
On the fucking farm

Are you born in a fucking barn or what?
Baaa, hold still

No, oh-oh
Is it true
What they say of you?

Gonna call the president
Gonna call a private eye
Gonna get the IRS
Gonna need the FBI

There's not anymore that I can do

All the reasons that you gave, I'd follow you
To when you'd lead and if that'd be the end of time, it's true
Wouldn't be the first time I been wrong
Wouldn't be the last I'm sure I've known
Through all the rumors, I could tell
Some things didn't work so well
Well, anyway, it feels the same

When you first told me you were gone
So long ago, but I still held on
Through all the motions, the love, and the sex
And that's the truth and here's the worst yet
Wouldn't even matter the things that I'd say
You made your mind up and gone, anyway
And there's no use now in draggin' it on
Shoulda seen it comin' all along


Well, it's true
Oh, I had my doubts of you, oh-oh

Gonna call the president
Gonna call myself a private eye
Gonna need the IRS
Gonna get the FBI
Gonna make this a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it, baby, with your morning news
With a sweet hangover and the headlines, too, now

Ah, ah

I bet you think I'm doin' this all for my health
I shoulda looked again, dated somebody else
Feelin' like I've done way more than wrong
Feelin' like I'm livin' inside of this song
Feelin' like I'm just too tired to care
Feelin' like I've done more than my share
Couldn't be the way that I've carried on
Like a broken record for so long
And I do, ooh-ooh

Gonna call the president
Gonna call a private eye
Gonna get the IRS
Gonna need myself the FBI

Ooh, what shall I do
If I gave my heart to you? Oh
It's such a crime, you know it's true

Oh

Gonna call the president
Gonna get myself a private eye
Ooh, gonna need the IRS
Gonna get the FBI
Gonna make it a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it, baby, with your morning news
With a sweet hangover and the headlines, too

There's not any more that I can do

Seems like forever and a day

If my intentions are misunderstood
Please be kind, I've done all I should
I won't ask of you what I would not do

Oh-oh-oh, I saw the damage in you, ooh-ooh
My fortunate one, the envy of youth

Why would they tell me to please those that laugh in my face?
When all of the reasons they've taught us fall over themselves to give way, oh yeah

It's not a question of whether my heart is true
Streamlined, I had to pull through
Look for a new beginning on you
Oh, I, I got a message for you, ooh
Up and away, it's what I got to do, ooh
Forgive what you have for what you might lose
What would you say if I told you that I'm to blame?
And what would you do if I had to deny your name?
Where would you go if I told you I love you and then walked away? Oh, yeah
And who should I turn to if not for the ones that you could not save? Oh, now

I told you when I found you
If there were doubts, you should be careful and unafraid
Now they surround you
And all that amounts to is love that you fed by perversion and pain


So, if my affections are misunderstood
And you decide I'm up to no good
Don't ask me to enjoy them just for you

Ask yourself why I would choose to prostitute myself
To live with fortune and shame? Oh, yeah
When you should have turned to the hearts
Of the ones that you would not save

I told you when I found you
All that amounts to is love that you fed by perversion and pain

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was around when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
I killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, haha

I watched with glee as your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the Gods they made
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all, it was you and me
So let me, please, introduce myself
I'm the man of the wealth and taste (Oh yeah)
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, yeah


Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah

Just as every cop's a criminal
And all the sinners' saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politics
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, oh

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah

Woo, who
Oh yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Oh yeah!
Tell me, baby, what's my name, oh
Tell me, honey, guess my name
Tell me, baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooo, who
Ooo, who
Ooo, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who

Look at your game, girl
Look at your game, girl

What a mad delusion
Living in that confusion
Frustration and doubt
Can you ever live without the game?
The sad, sad game
Mad game
Just to say love's not enough
If it can't be true
Oh, you can tell those lies, baby
But you're only fooling you

Can you feel
Are those feelings real?
Look at your game, girl
Go on, look at your game, girl

If'n you can't feel
And those feelings ain't real

Or you're gonna play crying
Stop trying
Or you're gonna play crying
Stop trying

That's the game

Yes, I imitate myself all of the time
Living like this never ever tore my life apart

Losin' touch with all that's real

Whole lotta lover, keepin' undercover
Never knowin' where you been, ooh, yeah

It ain't easy living like you wanna
And so hard to find piece of mind, yes it is
The way I see it, you got to say, "Shit," but
Don't forget to drop me a line

Bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for your daddy's just a drag
You still stuff your mouth with his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You're gonna climb back on the wagon

Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy

Sleepin' late and suckin' me, oh-oh, no


It ain't easy living like you wanna
And so hard to find piece of mind, yes it is
The way I see it, you got to say, "Shit," but
Don't forget to drop me a line

Bald as an egg at eighteen
And workin' for your daddy's just a drag
You still stuff your mouth with his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You're gonna climb back on the wagon

Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and suckin' me, oh-oh
Ow, ow, ow, yeah
Ow

If you're lookin' for a fight, then we'll have some fun
Stupid motherfuckers shouldn't have ragged on me
They can't see what I can see

Kickin' shit all over this town

Sweet, sweet taste of victory

If the world would end today
And all the dreams we had would all just drift away, ooh
You know, there's nothing more to say
If the world would end and our love slipped away, ooh

I never knew the way that you look at me
Would ever mean so much to me
But in my heart, I found the feelings that I've never shown
And now they've got the best of me

If the world would end today
And all the dreams we had would all just drift away, ooh
You know, there's nothing more to say
If the world would end and our love slipped away, ooh

Could ever be so close to me
But you're the only one I have ever loved that has ever loved me
And now you've got the best of me

If the world would end today
And all the dreams we had would all just drift away, ooh
You know, there's nothing more to say

And all the dreams we had would all just drift away, ooh
You know, there's nothing more to say

The monsters can't get me
The monsters can't get me
The monsters can't get me
The monsters can't get me

A tour de force of an evil old passion
A broken heart that was out of fashion
Dynamic duo keep your figure crashin'
My early warning was your Satan laughin'

I was there for you, it's all I could do
Oh, but it's all burnt down, oh but it's over now
I was there for you, it's all I could do
Oh, but it's all burnt down, oh but it's over now

The monsters can't kill me
The monsters can't kill me
The monsters can't help me

You stole my soul with the devil's romancin'
All alone in your bedroom, dancin'
Thought I could feel somebody worth havin'
But in the end, I guess you're good for the damage

I was there for you, it's all I could do
Oh, but it's all burnt down, oh but it's over now


The monsters can't kill me
The monsters can't kill me
The monsters can't get me
The monsters can't–

The more I did, what I did, I did for you
There's no excuses for the hell on Earth you put me through
I never cared how much I cared when I cared for you
To make you better, there was nothin' that I wouldn't do
I doubt there's anybody left that wants to know the truth
The dirty secret that you hid away inside of you
Who ever thought I'd be around to shed a light on you?
Well, here's the story, baby; I got nothin' else to do

I was there for you, it's all I could do
Oh, but it's all burnt down, oh but it's over now
I was there for you, it's all I could do
Oh, but it's all burnt down, oh but it's over now

I was there for you, it's all I could do
I was there for you, it's all I could do

The Ashtray's full and the coffee's cold
And the things you say... make you look so old

You've got nothing good to say
Keep your mouth shut
Nothing good to do
Mirror talks to you
Nothing's ever good enough for you

Sick of everything you say as you're goin' down
Sorry for everything
Sick of everything that you do as your going down
Look like a fool
Never meant to hurt no one
Just happened to be there next to you
As you were going down

I know this dark place
I heard these words
I've heard them before a million times
I've heard them yelled I've even heard them sung
Get into your car and drive just as fast as you can
You had your 15 minutes you tried to take an hour
Now No one needs your call

You've got nothing good to say
Keep your mouth shut
Nothing good to do
Mirror talks to you
Nothing's ever good enough for you

Sick of everything you say as you're goin' down

To live in the shade of beliefs that were fashioned
To leave you in slavery and drain out your soul
But what can I do when there's so many liars
That crawl through your veins like millions of spiders
That seek out their victims and who is the wiser?
Watch out
Gotcha

Oh my god, I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
Like nobody wanted to know

So give it away like they're not gonna fuck you
How much can you beg them to come back and haunt you
To broadcast your feelings and cause you to suffer
You're starting to bleed
They don't discover before it's too late
What will you offer
In ways of healing, oh, I'm so confused
Abused
Misused

Oh my god, I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
'Cause nobody wanted to know

Ooh, if it opens your eyes
Well, then it's better than a strong compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
Well, then it's better than the last compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shadows
If only you had let me know


And they won't give in 'cause they know what they're after
A kick in the face, like it's all that would matter
Oh

I've been taught just to murder and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
'Cause nobody wanted to know

Ooh, if it opens your eyes
Well, then it's better than a good compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know
Ooh, well then it's on with the show
Like the tides out on the ocean
The wave's already set in motion
The only one in the game who's lost is you

(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) I just refuse
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) 'Cause I just won't let you

Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me
Breaking me down with an endless monotony
Sometimes I feel like there's nothing that's stopping me
All things are possible, I am unstoppable

Some may convince you, no one can break through
I'm here to tell you you're worth more than they tell you

Can't understand why it seems like it has to be
Sometimes I feel like it's all opened up for me
Nothing's impossible, I am unconquerable

No one can make you do what they want to
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you

15 ContributorsHuman Being Lyrics
Ready
Whole different beast
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
Oh-oh yeah, oh yeah

Well if you don't like it
Go ahead find yourself a saint
Go ahead now try to find a boy
Who's gonna be what I ain't
What you need is
A plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint
Who's gonna sit through the madness
And always act so quaint
Well, maybe, yeah
Oh yeah, well, a
It's your new friend
You're really making a scene
And I've seen you
Bouncing around from machine to machine
But you know that they're never real
Never really what they seem
And you can count on
Generate some warmth
Then you'll see just what I mean
Oh, baby, baby, baby, yeah

And if I'm acting like a king
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And when it gets a bit obscene
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
I don't gotta walk 'round with my head on down
Just like a human, oh no, a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, a real proud human being

Won't you give me a little sip?
Why don't you give me a drag of that cigarette?
Why don't you try to give me something
That I'll never ever forget?
But now, could you blow it all on a million-dollar bet
Because you're liable to lose it
On the best loving, you've never had yet
Oh, baby, baby, oh yeah

And if I'm acting like a king
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And when it gets a bit obscene
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
I don't gotta walk 'round with my head on down
Just like a human, oh no, a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, a real proud human being

It's like I'm talking about the human race
You're trying to cover up a big disgrace
Oh, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on


Well, I may think that this whole scene is just a
Too appalling for me
Well, I may be the type who's just mad about
Every little thing that I see, but I can

Color that with history, and make it
Just what I want it to be, well I'm
Blowing my change on the fan magazines
With all the Hollywood refugees
Oh, baby, baby, oh yeah

And if I'm acting like a king
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And when it gets a bit obscene
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
I don't gotta walk 'round with my head on down
Just like a human, whoa no, a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, a real, real human being

I'm a human being
I'm a human being
I'm a human being
Ha hahaha haha ha
I'm a human being
Oh yeah
I'm a human being yeah

[Song 90: Every Rose Has Its Thorn]
2 ContributorsEvery Rose Has Its Thorn LyricsWe both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah, it does
I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say, loves a game
Of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah, it does
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains
I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways
But now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah, it does

[Song 91: Sex, Drugs, and Rock N’ Roll]
3 ContributorsSex, Drugs, and Rock N’ Roll LyricsIt was long ago
Seems like a dream
The day I sucked the air
From a bottle of whipped cream
And I got real high
And things got real slow
And I started talking like this
What's going on?
I don’t know
And then I sold my car
For a Greatful Dead ticket
My dad yelled at me
And he grounded me
And he said I was a dick
It was the worst day of my life
And I'll never forget
But the very next day
I was doing bong hits
In the back of my friend's chevy
So don’t tell me
We're winning the war on drugs
Cause drugs are like a big ol' can of raid
And you're all little bugs
And don't tell me
To not get high
'Cause I'm as low as I can get
Without kissing your ass
And blowing you at the same time

Man, don't tell me about love and peace
When one of the Joneses have a handgun
Pointed at me
Don’t tell me to just say no
I’m an addict, I say don't let me go
Whatever happened to sex drugs ’n' rock 'n' roll?
Now we just have AIDS crack and techno
So they busted me
So I say "fuck them up"
For selling dope
And I went to jail
And I wasn’t forgiven
Like that little fucker who shot the pope

And he said I had the right to remain silent
And they couldn't explain
But I didn't resist
And I was invited
'Cause all I ever wanted was the right to remain
And they questioned me
Yeah, they asked me "why?"
And I said "fuck off"
I don't think I should be shot
For selling pot
It's just my little way of saying "high"
Now my record's all fucked up
Now two times a week
They make me piss in a cup
Well what I want to do
Is piss down their throats

Okay, here's the sensitive part
They told me
That times have changed
Cause our parents had
Hendrix, Janice and Jim
But what about
River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain
And they told me
To praise the lord
But I've been waiting for so long
For him to call me back
I think I'm gonna go pray
At Betty Ford
And they told me
That life was fair
I can't smoke a plant that was made by God
But I can kill my wife if I'm a football player
And they told me
They told me to just ignore
But I'd rather smoke crack
Outta Nancy Reagan's skull
While gettin' a blowjob
From Tipper Gore

Yo, Iggy check it out
Huh

Dance to the beat of the living dead
Lose sleep, baby, stay away from bed
Raw power is sure to come running to you
If you're alone and you got the fear
So am I, baby, let's move out of here
Raw power is sure to come running to you

Raw power's got a magic touch
Raw power is much too much
Happiness is a-guaranteed
It was made for you and me
Raw power, honey, just won't quit
Raw power, I can feel it
Raw power, hear it, can't be spared
Popping eyes and a flashing feet
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
And you know that ain't right

Look in the eyes of the southern girl
Fall deep in love in the underworld
Raw power is sure to come running to you
If you're alone and you got the shakes
So am I, baby, I got what it takes
Raw power is sure to come running to you

Raw power's got a healing hand
Raw power can destroy a man
Raw power is so more than soul
Got a son called rock and roll
Raw power, honey, just won't quit
Raw power, I can feel it
Raw power honey, give me a spin
Get up, baby, and kiss my feet
Everybody always tryna tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Everybody always tryna tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Raw power it's got no place to go
Raw power, honey, it don't want to know
Raw power is a guaranteed O.D
Raw power is a laughing at you and me

I want to know
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Raw power
Raw power
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

In your silk upholstered chair
Talking to some rich folks that you know
Well I hope you won't see me
In my ragged company
You know I could never be alone
Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the US mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
Well, when you're sitting back
In your rose pink Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
I'll be in my basement room
With a needle and a spoon
And another girl to take my pain away
Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the US mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the US mail
Say it with dead flowers at my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
No I won't forget to put roses on your grave--

Instigate a simple life
And who's to say what's black or white?
Just because, you're curious

[Song 97: Cats in the Cradle]
4 ContributorsCats in the Cradle LyricsMy child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew he said
I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home?'
'Son, I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then.'
My son turned ten just the other day
He said, 'Thanks for the ball, Dad. Come on, let's play
Can you teach me to throw?'
I said, 'Not today. I got a lot to do.'
He said, 'That's okay.'
And then he walked away but the smile never dimmed and he said
'You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him.'
Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
'Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while?'
He shook his head and he said with a smile
'What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?'

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, 'I'd like to see you, if you don't mind.'
He said, 'I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talkin' to you.'
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

That it's alright, it's alright

Where to go? Where to see?
It's always been that way and it can never be

But it's alright, yeah, it's alright

Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn

That it's alright, it's alright

Don't you know that it's so good for you
You can be making love and see it all go through

But it's alright, it's alright

Told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find

That it's alright, it's alright

She's got a smile it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine


She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by

Oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh

5 ContributorsThe Seeker LyricsI've looked under chairs
I've looked under tables
I've tried to find the key
To fifty million fables
They call me 'The Seeker'
I've been searching low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
I asked Bobby Dylan
I asked The Beatles
I asked Timothy Leary
But he couldn't help me either
They call me 'The Seeker'
I've been searching low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
People tend to hate me
'Cause I never smile
As I ransack their homes
They wanna shake my hand
Focusing on nowhere
Investigating miles
I'm a seeker
I'm a really desperate man
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?
I'm happy when life's good and when it's bad I cry
I've got values but I don't know how or why
I'm looking for me
You're looking for you
We're looking in at each other
And we don't know what to do
They call me 'The Seeker'
I've been searching low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

[Song 103: Sail Sway Sweet Sister]
3 ContributorsSail Sway Sweet Sister Lyrics
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
That will love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
So sail away sweet sister
Because I'll always be in love with you

But let her be somebody else's queen
I don't want to know about you
Because too many others know what I mean
And that's why I got to live without you

I'm in love with a girl
Been talking about
I'm in love with a girl
That I can't live without
I'm in love but it feels like
I'm living it out
I'm in love but I think I picked a Bad Time
To be in love

[Song 104: Dust in the Wind]
2 ContributorsDust in the Wind LyricsA cover of the Todd Rundgren song “Dust in the Wind”, Performed live by Guns N' Roses several times.
Tell everybody that I am sorry, truly sorry
For all the wrong I've done
I never meant to hurt nobody, no, no
Lord, I never want to do no wrong

And I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated
And I know my ship, it won't be comin' in
And as I lay me down to take my rest
I can see that it's just dust in the wind

Take hold my hand, and hold it tighter, ever tighter
You must believe that I love you still
But my strength, it grows weaker and weaker
And my body has lost its will

And I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated
And I know my ship, it won't be comin' in
And as I lay me down to take my rest
I can see that it's just dust in the wind

Oh, Lord, I have lost once again
And there's no one to help me find my way home
Lord and I, Lord, I never want to hurt nobody
And I, Lord, I never want to do no wrong

And I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated
And I know my ship, it won't be comin' in
And as I lay me down to take my rest
I can see that it's just dust in the wind

[Song 105: Black Hole Sun]
4 ContributorsBlack Hole Sun Lyrics
In my eyes, indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
The sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?

Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore

Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun


Hang my head, drown my fear
Till you all just disappear

Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?

4 ContributorsJust Another Sunday LyricsThis is an unreleased song from the ‘Use Your Illusion’ sessions. Recorded at R.S. Studios, Canoga Park, LA 1990.
I know you've been dreaming about the times in our lives
But I've been screaming in my bed late at night
A space a little, little and your stack of pain
Makes it grip that skull, to me child that you'll stay
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch your eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay

Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday
Oh yeah, just another Sunday
Just another Sunday, oh yeah

There's too many games in a day for a simple man to face
That desperate moment in your life where you can't be afraid
Don't think your second chance will break around the bend
Because hearts don't always share love or the person on the other end
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch your eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay ya

Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday
Oh yeah, just another Sunday
Just another Sunday, oh yeah

Those are tickets for the same plane, bring it back to me
Because felling the same pain makes half the luxury
Take a walk away won't end the carousel
But if walking away can bring you back, then I wish you well
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay

Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday
Oh yeah, just another Sunday
Just another Sunday, oh yeah

4 ContributorsBring It Back Home Lyrics
Sweet little lady, don't you get crazy
Bring it back home to me
Woman little standing, dreaming to forget him
Bring it back home to me
When? Why wonder?
Brown-eyed stunner, come on
Bring it home to me
Kiss a little, fishing for your lover
Won't you bring it down home to me
See a sky lit on fire, seen the dog in here
She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her thing
You can see the love, like check an ounce for pain
Darling won't you wanna;
Sorry to resent, you said; gimme back
Keep your teeth
Never want to hold you
Never want to kiss you
I bet she's taking away from me
Never will repeat it, or never reprimand it
Will you bring it back home to me

Take care before my baby
When your baby gives it up for free
She just puts around, being lazy
But since she brings her lover to me
Don't need nothing to save me, say for a piece of your luxury
Like the doorfoot, you'll never gage it
I'll tell you just how it's going to be

I call your lover in the morning
When you have your cup of tea
You never give me your warning
So you better give her right up for me
Guess who's coming over, on your thinks;
That's such a surprise
If you're saying you never known her

Honey, you better open your eyes
Look out

See a real long fire, she's the dog in here
She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin
Break a back for her daddy, when she does her thing


I call your lover in the morning
When you have your cup of tea
You never give me a warning
So get yourself a letter from me
Ohhhh, where're you going, tell me; who're you to see?
I've been sleeping on your doorstep
Baby, won't you bring it back home to me

Get me something for my jealous mind
You don't get something for free
You just bring it down home to me

3 ContributorsNovember Rain (2022 Version) Lyrics

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah

'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were minе, all mine

So, if you want to love me
Thеn, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah


Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?


And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain


Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?

Since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
Down at the end of the lonely street
It's called Heartbreak Hotel

And you know
I get so lonely
So cold and lonely
I get so lonely I could die

Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
Where broken hearted lovers
Just a' cry'n their whole day through

And you know
It get's so lonely
I said they still get lonely
So cold and lonely, they could die

Take it!


Well, the bell hop's tears keep fallin'
And the night clerks dressed in black
They been so long on the lonely street
You know they're
Never ever comin' back

But you know that
They get lonely
I said they get so lonely
So fucking lonely, they could die

If your baby leaves you
You gotta' tell the tale
Just take a walk down on lonely street
To The Heartbreak Hotel


And you know
That you'll get so lonely
So dog-gone lonely
So cold and lonely
You wanna' die
One more time!


Since my baby left me
I've found a new place to dwell
Down at the end of a lonely street
It's called Heartbreak Hotel

And you know
I get so lonely
So cold and lonely
So fucking lonely
I could die


Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
You can do whatever you want tonight
But don't say goodbye
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't say goodbye now
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry

Mmmm-oooh, yeahhhh

Time keeps on flying
Think you're loving baby
But all your doing is crying

Can you feel
Are those feelings real
Look at your game, girl
Look at your game, girl
What a mad delusion
Living in that confusion
Frustration and doubt
Can you ever live without the game
The sad, sad game
Mad game
Just to say loves' not enough
If it can't be true
Oh, you can tell those lies baby but you're only fooling you

Can you feel
I know those feelings ain't real
Then you better stop trying
Or you're gonna play crying
Stop trying
Or you're gonna play crying
Stop trying
That's the game
Sad sad game
Mad game
Sad game

And take me for another ride


Put a path on to your veins
And antique and old whore's our new pain, yeah
The tears you cried

But you can't get out of sight

It's a gas, gas, gas
Ooh, yeah
Shuh-nah-nah-nah-now, honey

It's a gas, gas, gas
Ooh, yeah

Slash was drowned, he was washed up, left for dead
I looked round (... ? loaf) of bread
I looked down at my feet and saw they bled
Izzy was crowned with a spike right through his vein
But it's alright, now, in fact it's a gas

[Song 124: Civil War (2022 Remaster)]
2 ContributorsCivil War (2022 Remaster) Lyrics
What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you men

Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights

And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars


D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said: "Peace could last forever"?
And in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
You're power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no

Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before

Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more

My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still, the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
And all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars


We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example, to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
You're power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no no no
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
You're power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no, no, no
I don't need one more war
Ooh, I don't need one more war
No no no, no woah, no woah

What's so civil 'bout war anyway?

3 ContributorsDuplicate page* LyricsAll cautions made
Every chance was given
No effort spared
To save what we had
All in good faith
I would not hesitate
To extend myself
And lend you my hand
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
As tempers fade
And lies forgiven
No cause embraced
Could break what we had
In its place
A storm is lifting
I would've thought you could be more of a man
But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that wеre true, it wouldn't matter anyway

But you had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to bе a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
You had to play it cool, had to do it your way
Had to be a fool, had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true, it wouldn't matter anyway
You had to play it cool, had to do it your way

4 ContributorsEstranged (2022 Remaster) Lyrics
When you're talkin' to yourself and nobody's home
You can fool yourself, you came in this world alone (Alone)

So nobody ever told you, baby, how it was gonna be?
What'll happen to you, baby? Guess we'll have to wait and see
One, two

Old at heart, but I'm only 28
And I'm much too young to let love break my heart
Young at heart, but it's gettin' much too late
To find ourselves so far apart

I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately
An' what more could you ask from me?
How could you say that I never needed you?
When you took everythin', said, you took everythin' from me
Hey, yeah

Young at heart, an' it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out

Still, talkin' to myself and nobody's home (Alone)

So nobody ever told us, baby, how it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us, baby? Guess we'll have to wait and see


When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way, find another day
With all the changin' seasons
Of my life, maybe I'll get it right next time
An' now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds, back down on the ground
An' you don't talk so loud an' you don't walk so proud
Anymore and what for?


Well, I jumped into the river too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own an' driftin' all alone
If it doesn't show, give it time to read between the lines
'Cause I see the storm is gettin' closer
An' the waves, they get so high
Seems everythin' we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die?


I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through this time, woah, this time
Without you
I knew the storm was gettin' closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everythin' we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die

9 ContributorsNovember Rain (Acoustic Version / 1986 Sound City Session) Lyrics
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
(Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh)
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
(Ahhh ahhh, ahhh)
But nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
(Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh)
Cause it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
(Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh)

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just try'na to kill the pain

But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who is lettin' go today

Walking away
Cause when you take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head just knowin' that you were mine
(Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh)
All mine
So, if you wawna' love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
(Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh)
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Again, and again, and again, and again, and again
(Again, and again, and again, and again, and again ...)
And I know, that I'll just keep on walkin'

2 Contributors14 Years (2022 Remaster) Lyrics
I try and feel the sunshine, you bring the rain
You try and hold me down with your complaints
You cry and moan and complain, you whine an tear
Up to my neck in sorrow the touch you bring

You just don't step inside to, to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say and you know
I've been the beggar, I've played the thief
I was the dog they all tried to beat

But it's been 14 years of silence
It's been 14 years of pain
It's been 14 years that are gone forever and I'll never have again

Your stupid girlfriends tell you, that I'm to blame
Well, they're all used up has-beens out of the game
This time I'll have the last word, you hear what I say?
I tried to see it your way, it won't work today

You just don't step inside to, to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say, you know
I've been the dealer hangin' on your street
I was the dog they all tried to beat

But it's been 14 years of silence
It's been 14 years of pain
It's been 14 years that are gone forever and I'll never have again

Bullshit and contemplation, gossip's their trade
If they knew half the real truth, what would they say?
Well I'm past the point of concern, it's time to play
These last four years of madness sure put me straight

You don't get back 14 years in just one day
So hard to keep my own head, just go away, you know
Just like a hooker, she said, "Nothin's for free"
Oh, I tried to see it your way
I tried to see it your way

C'mon, we'll buy a bottle
Alright, I'm headin' to the store and I'm gonna buy smokes
Hot damn
Every night, I go out and get in my car, oh yeah
I push on the peddle but you know I go too far
There're parties everywhere that I can see
Usin' myself will be the death of me
Ya see every night I get a call on the telephone
My sweet little baby beggin' me just to come home
But I know that everyday I gotta have me some fun
With Suzy to the left and Sally to my right
I know that I need just more than one
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Let's go

When the night goes on and I seem to see some friends
Now a buck for the car for the gas goes so fast
With friends like that tell me who's gonna last
Well the city's hot but tonight I'm not
I want everything that everybody's got
Not a badge in the pan or a legend hand
Just give me one more, one last dance
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Let's go
Take the car, take the keys
Said my money don't grow on trees
You make me stumble and fall
'Til I'm bloody at my knees
I climbed back up to find that all my money's gone
Too much too soon not know since it's been so long
You can drive me to the edge but I really don't mind
Ya see when I'm in my car I leave you behind
There's another girl that's waitin' down the road
When I'm out the door you know that's just where I'll go

Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon
I don't care, get outta my room
Said it's too much too fast
I don't care if I won't last
Said it's too much too soon

Flyin' like an airplane
Feelin' like a space brain
One more time, tonight

Well, I'm-a west coast struttin'
One bad mother
Got a rattlesnake suitcase
Under my arm
Said I'm a mean machine
Been drinkin' gasoline
And, honey, you can make my motor hum
I got one chance left in a nine-live cat
I got a, a dog-eat-dog sly smile
I got a Molotov cocktail with a match to go
I smoke my cigarette with style
An' I can tell you honey
You can make my money, tonight
Wake up late
Honey, put on your clothes
Take your credit card to the liquor store
Well, that's one for you, and for me by tonight

I'll be loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane
Feelin' like a space brain
One more time, tonight

I'm on the nightrain
Bottoms up
I'm on the nightrain
Fill my cup
I'm on the nightrain
Ready to crash and burn
I never learn
I'm on the nightrain

Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted
I bought them for you graceless lady
You know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hand

Wild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses
Couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer
A dull aching pain
Now you're decided
To show me the same
No sweeping exits
Or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter
Or treat you unkind

I know I've dreamed you
A sin and a lie
I have my freedom
But I don't have much time
Faith has been broken
Tears must be cried
Let's do some living
After we die

Your daddy works in porno
Now that mommy's not around
She used to love her heroin
But now she’s underground
So you stay out late at night
And you do your coke for free
And you drive all your friends crazy
With your life's insanity

Well, well, well
You just can't tell
Well, well, well

Sowin’ all your wild oats
In another's luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday
Maybe Thursday you can sleep
But school starts much too early
And this hotel wasn't free
So you can run party errand
And I'll return the key

Well, well, well
You just can't tell
Well, well, well

You never can tell
Well, well, well

Everyone needs love
You know that it's true
Someday somebody's gonna
Fall in love with you
Whoa the time it takes
When you're all alone
Someday you’ll find someone
That you can call your own
’Til then ya better–
Ow!


Now you're clean and so discreet
And I won’t say a word
Most of all, this song is true
In case you haven't heard
But if you keep tryin'
We both know money burns
Don't stop your cryin’ and you'll get what you deserve

[Song 139: Atlas Shrugged]
2 ContributorsAtlas Shrugged Lyrics
Why should I try and judge the things they say
That just won’t budge, I’m letting go
And sheltered from the blind
So you managed to be kind
But still enough to show me how to keep it together
When I’m crying out in vain
No matter who’s to blame
There’s still a ways to go
So, if you ask me to believe your heart won’t follow you
It’s got a mind of its own

When it says “Run” and the road gets rough
And you’re the one
Whose shoulders just ain’t wide enough
Whose shoulders shrug when they’ve had enough

I’d be the last to say, "don’t follow your heart"
But there’s more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you've known
What you’ve shown
Than that we know you understand

It's not the thing, if I were you
I would say all that I do
To be half as strong, or still belong
If you should take the time
To look back at what you find
Your heart misadventures

When it says “Run” and the road gets rough
And you’re the one
Whose shoulders just ain’t wide enough
Whose shoulders shrug when they’ve had enough

I’d be the last to say, "don’t follow your heart"
But there’s more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you've known
What you’ve shown
Than that we know you understand
In fact, I never said, "don’t follow your heart"
If I thought that's what it takes to make a man
From what you've known
All that you’ve been shown
Gee, even now I'd hope you'd understand


I’d be the last to say, "don’t follow your heart"
But there’s more to what it takes to be a man
Than what you've known
And what you’ve shown
Than what we know you understand
In fact, I'd never say, "don’t follow your heart"
If I thought that's what it'd take to make a man
From what you've known
All that you’ve been shown
Gee, even now I'd hope you'd understand

[Song 140: The Blues]
4 ContributorsThe Blues LyricsThe early version of Street of Dreams was known as “The Blues”
All the love in the world couldn't save you
All the innocence inside
You know I tried so hard to make you
To make you change your mind

And it hurts too much to see you
And how you left yourself behind
You know I didn't want to be you
Now there's a hell I can't describe

So now I wander through my day
Trying to find my way
Still these feelings that I felt
I said to you and no one else

And though as long as this road seems
I know it's called the street of dreams
But that's not stardust on my feet
It leaves a taste that's bittersweet
That's called the blues

Don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you
You know it's what you planned, this much is true
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you anymore

What this means to me
The more I know you believe
What I thought was you now
Has got more that it changed on you

What I thought was true
The more that I might know is you
What I thought was you
Is only memories, distant

[Song 141: You Could Be Mine (2022 Remaster)]
4 ContributorsYou Could Be Mine (2022 Remaster) Lyrics

I'm a cold heartbreaker, fit to burn and I'll rip your heart in two
And I'll leave you lyin' on the bed
I'll be out the door before you wake 'em, it's nothin' new to you
'Cause I think we've seen that movie, too

'Cause you could be mine, but you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done, I said, you could be mine, aw

Now, holidays come and then they go, it's nothin' new today
Collect another memory
When I come home, late at night, don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars I'm home again

'Cause you could be mine, but you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done, I said, you could be mine

You could be mine, you could be mine
You could be mine, you could be mine
You could be mine, mine, mine, mine
You've gone sketching too many times
Ooh, why don't you give it a rest?
Why must you find another reason to cry?


Well, you're breakin' down my back and I've been rackin' out my brain
It don't matter how we make it, 'cause it always ends the same
You can push it for more mileage, but your flaps are wearing thin
And I could sleep on it until mornin', but this nightmare never ends
Don't forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands
An' you can take the pity so far, but it's more than I can stand
'Cause this couch-trip's gettin' older, tell me how long has it been?
'Cause five years is forever, and you haven't grown up yet

Oh, you could be mine, but you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done, I said, you could, you should be

You could be mine
Oh, you could be mine
You could be mine
Aw, you could be mine
You could be mine

Aw, You could be mine
Aw, You could be mine
Aw, You could be mine
You could be mine, yeah

[Song 142: Move to the City (1988 Acoustic Version)]
7 ContributorsMove to the City (1988 Acoustic Version) Lyrics
You pack your bags And you move to the city
There's somethin' missin' here at home
You fix your hair and you're lookin' real pretty
It's time to get it out on your own
You're always fightin' with your mama and you papa
Your family life is one big pain!
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began

You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move

You stole your mama's car
And your daddy's plastic credit card
You're sixteen and you can't get a job
You're not goin' very far
You're always ridin' with the teachers and the police
This life is much too insane
When you, you gonna move to the city?
Into the city where it all began

You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move

Right to the city Where the real men get it
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty
Come on and hit me

You're on the streets And it ain't so pretty
You need to get a new what you please
You do what you gotta do for the money
At times you end up on your knees

I'm always buyin' With the local and the junkies
This city life is one big pain!
But you, you had to move to the city
Into the city where it all began

You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Time you gotta move

Oh right to the city With the real nitty gritty
Aw, child, ain't it a pity?
Sometimes it gets too shitty
Come on and hit me

[Song 143: Rocket Queen (1986 Sound City Session)]
7 ContributorsRocket Queen (1986 Sound City Session) Lyrics
If I can say I don't need anyone
I can say these things to you, 'cause
I can turn on anyone
Just like I turned on you
I've got a tongue like a razor
A sweet switchblade knife
An' I can do you favors
But then you'll do whatever I like

'Cause here I am
And you're a rocket queen, oh yeah
I might be a little young but, baby, I ain't naive
Here I am and you're a rocket queen, uh-huh
I might be too much
But, honey, you're a bit obscene, oh
Ow!

I've had everything imaginable
Pass before these eyes
I've had everything that's tangible
Honey, you'd be surprised
I'm a sexual innuendo
In this burned-out paradise
If you turn me on to anything
You better turn me on tonight

Because here I am
And you're a rocket queen
I might be a little young but, baby, I ain't naive
Here I am, you're a rocket queen, uh-huh
I might be too much
But, honey, you're a bit obscene
Ow
Ow, sha


Here I am
And you're a rocket queen, uh-huh
I might be a little young but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, you're a rocket queen, oh no
I might be too much
But, baby, you're a bit obscene
Ow, sha


I see you standin'
Standin' on your own
It's such a lonely place for you
For you ta be
So if you need a shoulder
Or if you need a friend
I'll be here standin'
Until the bitter end
No one needs the sorrow
No one needs the pain
I hate to see you
Walkin' out there
In the rain
So, don't chastise me
Or think I mean you harm
Or those that take you, leave you strung out
Much too far, baby, yeah

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No-no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, no no no no
Oh yeah


Don't leave me
And say you'll always be there
All I ever wanted
Was for you
To know that I care

[Song 144: Don’t Cry [Alt. Lyrics] (2022 Remaster)]
2 ContributorsDon’t Cry  (2022 Remaster) Lyrics
If we could see tomorrow, what of your plans?
No one can live in sorrow, ask all your friends
Times that you took in stride, they're back in demand
I was the one who was washing blood off your hands

Don't you cry tonight, I still love you, baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

I know the things you wanted, they're not what you have
With all the people talking, it's driving you mad
If I was standing by you, how would you feel
Knowing your love's decided, and all love is real? Yeah, baby

Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight


I thought I could live in your world as years all went by
With all the voices I've hеard, something has died
And when you'rе in need of someone, my heart won't deny you
So many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to, baby

And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight, baby, maybe someday
Don't you cry, don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight

[Song 145: Locomotive (Complicity) [2022 Remaster]]
4 ContributorsLocomotive (Complicity)  Lyrics
Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness
Yeah, I'll find a way to cure the pain
If I said that you're my friend and our love would never end
How long before I had your trust again?
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Hoping that you'd find your own way in
But how can I protect you, or try not to neglect you
When you won't take the love I have to give?

Yeah, I bought me an illusion and I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams and I had to have them all
But, oh, the taste is never so sweet as what you'd believe it is
Well, I guess it never is, it's these prejudiced illusions
That pump the blood to the heart of the biz


You know, I never thought that it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah, I let you shape me, but I feel as though you raped me
'Cause you climbed inside my world and in my song
So now I've closed the door to keep the cold outside
Seems, somehow, I've found the will to live
But how can I forget you, or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive? Yeah, yeah

Sweetness is a virtue and you lost your virtue long ago
You know I'd like to hurt you but my conscience always tells me "No"
You could sell your body on the street to anyone whom you might meet
Who'd love to try and get inside and bust your innocence open wide

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no


Gonna have some fun with my frustration
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour 'cause this road ain't getting clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again
"Better tame that boy, 'cause he's a wild one
Better tame that boy 'fore he's a man"
Sweetheart, don't make me laugh, you's getting too big for your pants
And I think maybe you should cut out while you can

You can use your illusion, let it take you where it may
We live and learn, and then, sometimes, it's best to walk away
Me, I'm just here hanging on, it's my only place to stay
At least for now, anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions just to throw them all away


I'm taking time for quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy, so why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say?
Callin' off the dogs, a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you, I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page?

Kindness is a treasure and it's one, towards me, you've seldom shown
So, I'll say it, for good measure, to all the ones like you, I've known;
Ya know I'd like to shave your head and all my friends could paint it red
'Cause love to me is a two-way street, an' all I really want is peace

But my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no


Affection is a blessing, can you find it in your sordid heart?
I tried to keep this thing together but the tremor tore my pad apart
Yeah, I know, it's hard to face when all we've worked for's gone to waste
But you're such a stupid woman and I'm such a stupid man
But love, like time, 's got its own plans

But my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no
Yeah, if love is blind, I guess I'll buy myself a cane


Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange

And no religion too

And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions

No need for greed or hunger

Sharing all the world...

And the world will live as one

2 ContributorsGet In The Ring (2022 Remaster) Lyrics
Yeah, c'mon

Why do you look at me, when you hate me?
Why should I look at you, when you make me hate you too?
I sense a smell of retribution in the air
I don't even understand why the fuck you even care

And I don't need your jealousy, yeah
Why drag me down in your misery? (Yeah)

And when you stare, you don't think I feel it
But I'm gonna deal it back to you in spades
When I'm having fun, you know I can't conceal it
'Cause I know you'd never cut it in my game, oh, no

And when you're talking about a vasectomy, yeah
I'll be writing down your obituary, history, ouh

You got your bitches with the silicone injections
Crystal meth and yeast infections
Bleached blond hair, collagen lip injections
Who are you to criticize my intentions?
Got your subtle, manipulative devices
Just like you, I got my vices
I got a thought that would be nice
I'd like to crush your head, tight in my vice
Pain

And that goes for all you punks in the press, that want to start shit by printing lies instead of the things we said
That means you, Andy Secher at Hit Parader, Circus magazine, Mick Wall at Kerrang!
Bob Guccione Jr. at Spin, what you pissed off 'cause your dad gets more pussy than you?
Fuck you, suck my fucking dick
You be ripping off the fucking kids while they be paying their hard-earned money to read about the bands they want to know about?
Printing lies, starting controversy, you want to antagonize me?
Antagonize me, motherfucker, get in the ring, motherfucker and I'll kick your bitchy little ass, punk


I don't like you, I just hate you
I'm gonna kick your ass
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, ouh
Ahahahaha
Ahahahaha
Ahahahaha

You may not like our integrity, yeah
We built a world out of anarchy, oh yeah

And in this corner, weighing
In at 850 pounds, Guns N' Roses!
Get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring
Get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring (get the fuck in!)
Get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring
Get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring, get in the ring
Yeah

This song is dedicated to all the Guns N' Fuckin' Roses fans
Who've stuck with us through all the fucking shit
And to all those opposed - hmm, well...

3 ContributorsDust N’ Bones (2022 Remaster) Lyrics
He lost his mind today
He left it out back on the highway
I-65

She loved him yesterday
Yesterday's over, I said, "Okay, that’s alright"
Time moves on, that's the way
We live in hope to see the next day, but that's alright

Sometimes, these things, they are so easy
Sometimes, these things, they are so cold
Sometimes, these things just seem to rip you right in two
Oh no, man, don’t let 'em get to you
Oh yeah, ow, yeah

She loved him yesterday
He laid her sister, she said, "Okay, that's alright"
Buried her things today
Way back out, deep behind the driveway and that's alright

Sometimes, these women are so easy
Sometimes, these women are so cold
Sometimes, these women seem to rip you right in two
Only if you let 'em get to you
Oh, oh yeah

Get out on your own
And you take all that you own
And you forget about your home
And then you're just fucking gone


There's no logic here, today
Do as you got to, go your own way, I said, that's right
Time’s short, your life’s your own
And in the end, we are just

Dust an' bones
Dust an’ bones
Dust an' bones
An' that's all right, dust an’ bone
An' that's all right, dust an' bone
An' that's all right, dust an' bone
An' that's all right, dust an' bone

That's all right, dust an' bone
That's all right
Just dust an' bones, yeah

Since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
Down at the end of a lonely street
It's called Heartbreak Hotel

And you know
I get so lonely
So cold and lonely
I get so lonely, I could die

Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
Where broken-hearted lovers
Just a' cry their whole day through

And you know
They get so lonely
I said, they still get lonely
So cold and lonely, they could die
Take it!


Well, the bell hop's tears keep fallin'
And the night clerk's dressed in black
They been so long on the lonely street
You know they're never ever comin' back

But you know that
They get lonely
I said, they get so lonely
So fuckin' lonely, they could die

If your baby leaves you
You gotta tell the tale
Just take a walk down on lonely street
To the Heartbreak Hotel

And you know
That you'll get so lonely
So God-awful lonely
So cold and lonely, you wanna die

One more time!


Since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
Down at the end of a lonely street
It's called Heartbreak Hotel

And you know
I get so lonely
So cold and lonely
So fuckin' lonely, I could die

Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry

Don't say goodbye

Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't say goodbye, now
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
