Once upon a time, not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer


Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear

Woah, we're halfway there

Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Woah, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Yeah, you give love a bad name

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

Woah, you're a loaded gun
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame

This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for faith-departed

I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive

Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

Yeah, this is for ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down

Tomorrow's gettin' harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, gotta make your own breaks

It's my life, and  it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway

Better stand tall when they're callin' you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

This Romeo is bleedin', but you can't see his blood
It's nothin' but some feelin's that this old dog kicked up
It's been rainin' since you left me, now I'm drownin' in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter, but without you, I give up

I can't sing a love song like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore, but baby, that's just me

Yeah, I will love you, baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day
Always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I love you
Always

Now your pictures that you left behind are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry, one that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair, to touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needin' to hear
I'll wish I was him, 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'til the end of time

And I will love you, baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day
Always

If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face, there's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you


Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice
But, baby, if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

Yeah, I will love you, baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day
Always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you
Always

Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take's on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

Well, this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah


Now as you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as

Well, as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I pray to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
And baby, you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your Valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine, woah

Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you


I wasn't there when you were happy
I wasn't there to make you happy
And I wasn't there when you were down, child
Didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out
Oh-oh

I'll be there for you, these five words I'd swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you

On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
(All your life) All your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you
But you were livin' in another world, tryna get a message through

No one heard a single word you said
They shoulda seen it in your eyes
What was goin' around your head (ooh-ooh)

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

Take a line every night, guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, callin' for a wild time
So you sit home alone, 'cause there's nothin' left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you

You know she likes the lights at night on the neon Broadway sign
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find (ooh-ooh)

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway


No one heard a single word you said
They shoulda have seen it in your eyes (seen it in your eyes)
What was goin' around your head

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
Now she works the night away
Oh, she's a little runaway
Run, run, run, run, run, a little runaway
(Daddy's girl learned fast)
(All those things she couldn't say)
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Run, run, run, run, run, a little runaway

Now she works the night away)

I should have seen it coming when the roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are "know-it-alls" and I played that fool for you

I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)

I ain't got a fever, got a permanent disease
And it'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money, but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms, count 'em, one, two, three

First, you need (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little, and it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug

Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine

I don't need no needle to be givin' me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction that doesn't leave a track
I gotta jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

When you need (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little, but it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Now, this boy is addicted for your kiss is the drug

Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine

Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine
Is what I want
Bad, bad medicine
Oh, it's what I need


I need a respirator 'cause I'm runnin' out of breath
You're an all-night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine, you take what you can get
'Cause if there's somethin' better, baby, well, they haven't found it yet

Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine
Is what I want
Bad, bad medicine
Who's bad? Who's bad?
(Bad, bad medicine) I gotta know, I gotta, I gotta go, I gotta

I gotta, I gotta
I gotta do it again, wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on
I'm not done
One more time, with feelin'
Come on

I was walking around, just a face in the crowd
Trying to keep myself out of the rain
Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown
Wondered if I might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner
Singing old songs about change
Everybody got their cross to bare these days

She came looking for some shelter
With a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
I guess she's trying to be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples
And all the wannabes
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days

These days, the stars seem out of reach
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast, nothing lasts in this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

Jimmy Shoes, he busted both his legs
Trying to learn to fly
From a second story window
He just jumped and closed his eyes
His momma said he was crazy
He said, "Momma, i've got to try
Don't you know that all my heroes died?
And I guess I'd rather die than f-f-fade away", yeah

These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, nothing lasts, it's a graceless age

These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, love don't last, it's a graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train
These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, nothing lasts, there ain't no time to waste
There ain't nobody left to take the blame
Oh no no no, ain't nobody left but us these days

Tell me, baby, when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside?
Do you tell me all's forgiven
Just hide behind your pride?
Yeah

(Everybody needs somebody to love)
Mother, father (Everybody needs somebody to hate)
Please don't leave me
(Everybody's bleedin' 'cause the times are tough)
Well, it's hard to be strong when there's no one to dream on

I've been walkin' in the footsteps
Of society's lies
I don't like what I see no more
Sometimes I wish that I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever
To stand out in the rain
So no one sees me cryin'
Tryna wash away this pain

Mother, father (Everybody needs somebody to love)
There's things I've done I can't erase
(Everybody needs somebody to hate) And every night we fall from grace
(Everybody's bitchin' 'cause they can't get enough) It's hard with the world in your face
(Everybody bleeds, everybody, keep the faith) Tryna hold on, tryna hold on

Lord, you gotta keep the faith

[Song 15: Have a Nice Day]
19 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsHave a Nice Day Lyrics
Why you wanna tell me how to live my life?
And who are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference 'tween a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away

Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shinin' like a diamond, rollin' with the dice
Standin' on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say have a nice day
Have a nice day

Take a look around you, nothin's what it seems
We're livin' in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helpin' hand
Of anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Lookin' for forgiveness and what's left to believe

Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shinin' like a diamond, rollin' with the dice
Standin' on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say have a nice day
Have a nice day

Oh

Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shinin' like a diamond, rollin' with the dice
Standin' on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

(Have a nice day) When the world keeps tryin' to drag me down
(Have a nice day) Gotta raise my hands, gonna stand my ground
(Have a nice day) Well, I say, hey, have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Shot through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call love

Would you be content to see me cryin'?
After all those little games you put me through
After all I've done for you, you're lyin'
Wouldn't it be nice to tell the truth?

Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're gonna take a fall?
I gave you everything
Now here's the curtain call

And I'm shot through the heart
As I lay there alone in the dark
Through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call love

Now you've come back here to say you're sorry, hah!
I just don't know who you're talkin' to
It could be the man I used to be, girl
I've grown up and now I'm over you

Standing there, just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn
You were gonna set the world on fire
But you never learn

Now you're shot through the heart
As I lay there alone in the dark
Through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call love


Standing there, just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn
You were gonna set the world on fire
But you never learn?
Now you're shot (shot, shot, shot)

Baby does what Baby please
Baby must have what she sees
But not this time, the table's turned
And Baby just got burned

Shot through the heart
As I lay there alone in the dark
Through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call

Shot (Shot) through the heart
As I lay (Shot) there alone in the dark
Through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call
Shot (Shot) through the heart (Shot)
As I lay (Shot) there alone in the dark (Shot)
Through the heart (Shot)
It's all part (Shot) of the game (Shot) that we call
Shot (Shot) through the heart (Shot)
As I lay (Shot) there alone in the dark (Shot)
Through the heart (Shot)
It's all part (Shot) of the game (Shot) that we call
Shot (Shot) through the heart (Shot)
As I lay there alone in the dark (Shot)

It's all part (Shot) of the game that we call love

If you could see inside my heart
Then you would understand
I'd never mean to hurt you
Baby, I'm not that kind of man
I might not say I'm sorry
Yeah, I might talk tough sometimes
And I might forget the little things
Or keep you hangin' on the line

In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget (Can't forget)
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
Into the fire, we cry

I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
I'd do anything
I'd lie for you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
If it came right down to me and you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you

I might not be a savior
And I'll never be a king
I might not send you roses
Or buy you diamond rings
But if I could see inside you
Maybe I'd know just who we are
'Cause our love is like a hunger
Without it, we would starve

In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget (Can't forget)
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
Into the fire, we cry

I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
I'd do anything
I'd lie for you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
If it came right down to me and you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you


I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
I'd do anything
I'd lie for you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
If it came right down to me and you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs 'cause there's bills to pay
But we got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothin' when I'm by your side
We got somethin' that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride

My heart beats like a drum (All night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (And it's alright)
And I'll never let go 'cause there's somethin' I know deep inside

You were born to be my baby
Baby, I was made to be your man
We got somethin' to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet He must've had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby, that's okay
Our time, our way
So hold me close, better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
Two kids hitchin' down the road of life
Our world, our fight

If we stand side by side (All night)
There's a chance we'll get by (And it's alright)
And I'll know that you'll live in my heart 'til the day that I die

As I walk her down the aisle
Wish it were a thousand miles
My beautiful baby, so beautiful
These tears fallin' from my eyes
They're taking me by surprise
My beautiful baby, a beautiful bride

It's time for me to step aside
Lift your veil and let you fly
Let the preacher say love's favorite line
"You may kiss the bride"

"I do"'s and a band of gold
A promise to have and hold
My beautiful baby, so beautiful
A sight that I won't forget
White rice on thе old church steps
My beautiful baby, a beautiful bridе

"Just Married" sign, you drive away
First dance, then you cut the cake
We'll say each word and hold a glass up high
"You may kiss the bride"

A father's prayer only angels hear
May your days be many, the way be clear
May the road be kind, your eyes stay bright
May your life be as beautiful
As you look tonight


I used to be your Superman
My whole world in your little hand
Now he's your world, that's right, I'll step aside
Now she's your world, alright, I'll step aside
"You may kiss the bride"

Who are you and who am I
To think that we could ever fly?
It don't pay to even try
Work, get paid, and just get by
Sons of sons, bricks on bricks
What's broken you don't try to fix
'Round here, there ain't no whys and ifs
You don't pick up what you can't lift

I raise my hands up to the sky
Don't need more to tell me I'm alive

Got what I want 'cause I got what I need
Got a fistful of friends that'll stand up for me
Right where I am is where I wanna be
Friday night comes around like a song
"Sweet Caroline," and we all sing along
Got my brown-eyed girl, and she believes in me
Legendary

I know this town like the back of my hand
Every crack in the sidewalk tells me who I am
"Live and you love" is the law of the land
These are our dreams, that's where we stand

Raise my hands up to the sky
Don't need more to tell me I'm alive

Got what I want 'cause I got what I need
Got a fistful of friends that'll stand up for me

We need the spark to light the fire
Show me the promise, give me some feelin'
There's too much hurtin', we need some healin'

Take a look into these eyes

And I would do anything

To have you in these arms tonight

Baby I want you
Like the roses want the rain
You know I need you
Like a poet needs the pain
And I would give anything
My blood, my love, my life
If you were in these arms tonight

I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms

And love you till the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight

Tonight they're shutting down the borders
And they boarded up the schools
Small towns are rollin’ up their sidewalks
One less paycheck comin' through
I know you're feelin’ kinda nervous
We're all a little bit confused
Nothing's the same, this ain't a game
We gotta make it through

As we wave outside the window
Older loved ones stay inside
Moms and babies blowin' kisses
May be saving someone's life
They had to cancel graduation
It ain't fair to Skype the prom
Our kids sit homе in isolation
TV news is always on

When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This ain’t my prayer, it’s just a thought I'm wanting to sеnd
’Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

The chicken farm from Arkansas bought workers PPE
Not before five hundred more had succumbed to this disease
Honest men and honest women workin' for an honest wage
I got a hundred point one fever, and we still got bills to pay

When you can’t do what you do
You do what you can
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

They built a hospital on East Meadow in Central Park last night
Doctors, nurses, truckers, grocery store clerks manning the front lines
I saw a Red Cross on the Hudson
They turned off the Broadway lights
Another ambulance screams by
There by the grace of God go I

Although I'll keep my social distance
What this world needs is a hug
Until we find the vaccination
There's no substitute for love
So love yourself and love your family
Love your neighbor and your friend
Ain't it time we loved a stranger?
They're just a friend you ain't met yet

When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
When you can't do what you do

I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

Now I ain't looking back
It's been a long, long road
Feels like I never left, that's how the story goes

I was born to be of service
Camp Lejeune just felt like home
I had honor, I found purpose
"Sir, yes, sir," that's what I know
They sent us to a place
I never heard of weeks before
When you're nineteen it ain't hard to sleep
In the desert on God's floor
Close your eyes, stop counting sheep
You ain't in boot camp anymore

We were taught to shoot our rifles
Men and women side by side
Thought we'd be met as liberators
In a thousand-year-old fight
I got this painful ringing in my ear
From an IED last night
But no lead-lined Humvee war machine
Could save my sergeant's life
Three more soldiers, six civilians
Need these words to come out right

God of mercy, God of light
Save your children from this life
Hear these words, this humble plea
For I, have seen the suffering
And with this prayer, I'm hopin'
That we can be unbroken

It's eighteen months now, I’ve been stateside
With this medal on my chest
But there are things I can't remember
And there are things I won't forget
I lie awake at night
With dreams the Devil shouldn't see
I wanna scream, but I can't breathe
And Christ, I'm sweatin' through these sheets
Where's my brothers? Where's my country?
Where's my "how things used to be"?

God of mercy, God of light
Save your children from this life
Hear these words, this humble plea
For I, have seen the suffering
And with this prayer, I'm hopin'
That we can be unbroken

My service dog's done more for me
Than the medication would
There ain't no angel that's comin' to save me
But even if they could

Today, twenty-two will die from suicide
Just like yesterday, they're gone
I live my life for each tomorrow
So their memories will live on
Once we were boys, and we were strangers
Now we're brothers and we're men
Someday, you'll ask me, "Was it worth it
To be of service in the end?"
Well, the blessing and the curses
Yeah, I'd do it all again

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Song 27: Story of Love]
11 ContributorsStory of Love Lyrics
Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive, 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love

They can offer advice that you don't wanna hear
Words that cut like a knife and still ring in your ear
You think of them ignorant, they think of you arrogant
If you need evidence, who gave you confidence?

A snap of the finger and you're not a child
But you're still holdin' on as you walk down the aisle
When they give you away to hear someone else say
That someone will love you 'til their dyin' day

Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love
And that's the story of love

You can choose to remember or choose to forget
If they took you to school or they tucked you in bed
You can say it don't matter, you won't do the same
You'd think no one noticed when you looked away

Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love

Now they're getting older, and you ain't so young
So you take care of them like your daughters and sons
You can ask for forgiveness, they could ask for the same
Forget all the anguish, the heartache, the pain

Wherever you go or wherever you've been
It's them that is with you, and that's you that's with them
Fathers and daughters and mothers and sons
As one story ends, another's begun

Oh, fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive 'til you walk, 'til you run
There is nothin' but pride, there is nothin' but love
From hello to goodbye, that's the story of love
That's the story of love

[Song 28: Living Proof]
11 ContributorsLiving Proof Lyrics
Does the sun still shine on a dead-end street?
Will a rose still grow out of broken concrete?
Is there anything left for a sinner like me?

I'm tired of talking 'bout someday
All that we've been given are the dog days
Nothing is forgiven, it's the hard way
Right or wrong
I'm tired of talking 'bout somehow
Wake up and it's welcome to your breakdown
This family's tree got nothing left to prove now
Me and you, we're the living proof

Close your eyes and tell me what you think you see
Is faith and hope enough to make a fool believe
Is there anything left for a sinner like me?

I'm tired of talking 'bout someday
All that we've been given are the dog days
Nothing is forgiven, it's the hard way
Right or wrong
I'm tired of talking 'bout somehow
Wake up and it's welcome to your breakdown
This family's tree got nothing left to prove now
Me and you, we're the living proof


First the son becomes a father
Then the father is a son
It's a never-ending circle
And the circle's never done
This love will last forever
We're not footprints in the sand
It's time to understand

I'm tired of talking 'bout someday
All that we've been given are the dog days
Nothing is forgiven, it's the hard way
Right or wrong
I'm tired of talking 'bout somehow
Wake up and it's welcome to your breakdown
This family's tree got nothing left to prove now
Me and you, we're the living proof

These four walls have got a story to tell
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
The door is off the hinges, there's no wish in the well
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Outside the sky is coal black, the streets are on fire
The picture window's cracked and there's nowhere to run
I know, I know
This house is not for sale

I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale

Comin' home
I'm comin' home

Drove a spike into the ground and I staked my claim
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Standin' on the dirt where they'll dig my grave
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Now what built these walls is in my veins
No time for lookin' back, the wolf is at the door
This heart, this soul
This house is not for sale

I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale

Comin' home
I'm comin' home

This house (House) was built on trust (Trust)
That's what it is, and always was
No wreckin' ball (Wreckin' ball) could knock it down (Down)
This house was built on higher ground


I set each stone and I hammered each nail
This house is not for sale
Where memories live and the dream don't fail
This house is not for sale

Comin' home
I'm comin' home

Comin' home
(I'm comin' home) This house is not for sale
(Comin' home)
I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home

Sippin' wine, killin' time
Tryna to solve life's mysteries
How's your life? It's been a while
God, it's good to see you smile
I see you reachin' for your keys
Lookin' for a reason not to leave

If you don't know if you should stay
If you don't say what's on your mind
Baby, just breathe
There's no where else tonight we should be
You wanna make a memory?

I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
It's bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringin', I don't wanna ask

If you go now, I'll understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan

You wanna make a memory?
You wanna steal a piece of time?
You can sing a melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory?

I see you thinkin' twice
Wish I could read your mind
Move up or out of line
Too late for prayin', I
Know we might lose our breath
We might be scared to death
This chance is like a step
Just gotta take it

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Countdown to here we go-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Hold on tight, slide a little closer
Up so high stars are on our shoulders
Time flies by, don't close your eyes
Kiss by kiss, love is like a thrill ride
What goes up might take us upside down
Life ain't a merry-go-round

It's a roller coaster
It's a roller coaster

Can't lie and won't pretend
I know what's 'round the bend
Too late to start again
Won't take it slower
Let's slip right off these tracks
We'll fly or we might crash
Don't look down, don't look back
'Cause it ain't over

Hold on tight, slide a little closer
Up so high stars are on our shoulders
Time flies by, don't close your eyes
Kiss by kiss, love is like a thrill ride
What goes up might take us upside down

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Yeah, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on that marble arch
Your love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What was going on below
Now you don't never show that to me, do you?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, now maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not your cry that I hear at night, no
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Stay alive, stay alive
Shine a light, stay alive
Use your voice and you remember me
American reckoning

I'll never know what it's like
To walk a mile in his shoes
And I'll never have to have the talk
So it don't happen to you
Three little words written 'cross the chest
Of a twelve year old who hasn't lived life yet
"Am I next? Am I next?"

Stay alive, stay alive
Shine a light, stay alive
Use your voice and you remember me
American reckoning


Is this a moment or movement?
Is this the tide or a flood?
Is our American reckoning?
Our story written in blood
Or in love
Or in peace

Stay alive, stay alive
Shine a light, stay alive
Use your voice and you remember me
Stay alive, stay alive
Shine a light, stay alive
Use your voice and you remember me

You sell yourself on hopes and dreams
That leaves you feeling sideways
Tripping over my own feet
Trying to walk to my own beat
Another car out on the street trying to find the Highway
Yeah, Are you going my way?

This is the story of my life
And I write it everyday
I know it isn't black and white
And it's anything but grey
I know that no I'm not alright, but I feel ok cos
Anything can, everything can happen
That's the story of my life

I gonna write the melody
That's gonna make history
And when I paint my masterpiece I swear I'll show you first
There just ain't a way to see who and why or what will be
Till now is then
It's a mystery, it's a blessing and a curse
Or something worse

This is the story of my life
And I write it everyday
I know it isn't black and white
And it's anything but grey
I know that no I'm not alright, but I feel ok cos
Anything can, everything can happen
That's the story of my life

This is the story of my life
And I write it everyday
And I hope you're by my side when I'm writing the last page

This is the story of my life
And I write it everyday
I know it isn't black and white
And it's anything but grey
I know that no I'm not alright, but I feel ok cos
Anything can, everything can happen

Ever since there was thunder
There's been shelter from the storm
A place to run for cover
'Til the rain clouds had moved on
Now when I get that feelin'
Before the first drop hits the ground
I'm askin', "Who's gonna stop the rain from fallin' down?"

Wherever there's a soldier
Who won't give up the fight
Wherever there's a darkness
That's tryin' to find the light
Wherever there is hurtin'
There's healing on the way
Like sunshine breakin' through a cloudy day

Let it rain, let it rain
Let the rain fall all around
Who's gonna stop the rain from fallin' down?

Maybe someday, eyes won't judge you
By the bed you're sleepin' in
The God you wanna pray to
Or the color of your skin
When priests and politicians
Tell the truth and nothin' more
That day, we'll know what all of this was for

Let it rain, let it rain
Let the rain fall all around
Who's gonna stop the rain from fallin' down?

These ain't pretty pictures that we're keepin in the cloud
Outside, a storm is raging
Just take a look around

Somewhere, there's forgiveness
For the broken ones like me
Who once stared down mighty mountains
And now sit beneath the trees
And somewhere, there's a church bell
That's summoning the choir
Somewhere, there's a dreamer
Who would walk a thousand miles
Somewhere, there's a dreamer
Who would walk a thousand miles

Let it rain, let it rain
Let the rain fall all around
Who's gonna stop the rain from fallin'?
If you're out there, Christ, I'm calling
Who's gonna stop the rain from fallin' down?

9 ContributorsMisunderstood Lyrics
Should I?
Could I have said the wrong things right a thousand times?
If I could just rewind, I see it in my mind
If I could turn back time, you'd still be mine

You cried, I died
I should have shut my mouth, things headed south
As the words slipped off my tongue, they sounded dumb
If this old heart could talk, it'd say you're the one
I'm wasting time when I think about it

I should have drove all night
I would have run all the lights
I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words
Did the best I could
Damn, misunderstood

Could I?
Should I apologize for sleeping on the couch that night?
Staying out too late with all my friends
You found me passed out in the yard again
You cried, I tried
To stretch the truth, but didn't lie
It's not so bad when you think about it

I should have drove all night
I would have run all the lights
I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words
Did the best I could
Damn, misunderstood
Intentions good


It's you and I, just think about it

I should have drove all night
I would have run all the lights
I was misunderstood
I stumbled like my words
Did the best I could
I'm hanging outside your door
I've been here before
Misunderstood
I stumbled like my words
Did the best I could
Damn, misunderstood
Intentions good

Across the border they turn
Water into wine
Some say it's the devil's blood
They're squeezing from the vine
Some say it's a savior
In these hard and desperate times
You see it helps me to forget
That we're just born to die

I came here like so many did
To find a better life
To find my piece of easy street
And finally be alive
I knew nothing good comes easy
All good things take some time
I made my bed, I'll lie in it
To die in it's the crime
You can't help but prosper
Where the streets are paved with gold
They say the oil wells ran deeper here
Than anybody's known
Now I packed up on my wife and kid
And left them both back home
See, there's nothing in this pay dirt
The ghosts are all I know

Now the oil's gone
And the money's gone
All the jobs are gone
Still we're hanging on

Down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one is getting out of here alive
(Not this time)

"In the blessed name of Jesus"
I heard a preacher say
"We are all God's children
And he'd be back, back someday"
I hoped that he knew
Something as he drank that cup of wine
I didn't have too good of a feeling
As I head out to the night

I cursed the sky to open
I begged the clouds for rain
I prayed all night for water
For this burning in my veins (Every night's the same)
It was like my soul's on fire
And I had to watch the flames
All my dreams went up in ashes
And my future blew away

Now the oil's gone
And the money's gone
All the jobs are gone
Still we're hanging on

Down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash theese sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one's getting out of here alive


A man spends his whole life
Waiting praying for some big reward
But it seems sometimes
That payoff leaves you feeling
Like a dirty whore
If I could choose the way I'd die
Make it by the gun or knife
Because the other way there's too much pain
Night after night after night after night

Oh, down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one's getting out of here
Dry County
No one is getting out of here
Dry County
No

[Song 43: Social Disease]
10 ContributorsSocial Disease Lyrics
You can read it in the papers
In some places, it comes in thirty-two flavors
But you wouldn't tell no one your favorite
If you could
From the White House to the alleys
From the president down to Long Tall Sally
Can't live with it, but you'd die without it
Yes, you would

Señorita's in the kitchen, she's a fistful of dynamite
You call 911, but you can't stop the fun tonight, it's alright

You can't start a fire without a spark
But there's somethin' that I guarantee
You can't hide when infection starts
Because love is a social disease
Love is a social disease

Where you look, you can find it
Try to run, but you're always behind it
So you play hide-and-seek like a blind kid
'Til you're caught, yeah, you're caught
So you'll say, hey, that you had some
But they took it and held it for ransom
Were they tall, dark, skinny, or handsome?
You won't talk, nah

So you telephone your doctor just to see what pill to take
You know there's no prescription gonna wipe this one away, oh

You can't start a fire without a spark
But there's somethin' that I guarantee
You can't hide when infection starts
Because love is a social disease
Love is a social disease
Love is a social disease
Let the boys show you, baby


She's so full of high-grade octane
She could run the bullet train on 38 double-D's
Now you know for sure, she knows the cure
To make any blind man see

You can't start a fire without a spark
But there's somethin' that I guarantee, yeah
You can't hide when infection starts
Because love is a social disease
Love is a social disease

You can't start a fire without a spark
But there's somethin' that I guarantee
You can't hide when infection starts
Because love is a social disease
Love is a social disease, baby
Love is a social disease

You're right
Nothing a shot can't cure

Hey

Well, I can still remember
When I was just a kid
When friends were friends forever
And what you said was what you did
Well, it was me and Danny and Bobby
We cut each other's hands
Held tight to a promise
Only brothers understand

Oh, we were so young (So young) (So young)
One for all and all for one (All for one)
Just as sure that the river's gonna run

Blood on blood
One on one
We'd still be standin' when all was said and done
Blood on blood
One on one
And I'll be there for you 'til Kingdom come
Blood on blood

Well, Bobby was our hero
'Cause he had this fake ID
When I got busted stealin' cigarettes
And Bobby took the rap for me
Well, Danny knew this white trash girl
We each threw in a ten
She took us to this cheap motel
And turned us into men

Oh, we were so young (So young) (So young)
One for all and all for one (All for one)
Just as sure that the river's gonna run

Blood on blood
One on one
We'd still be standin' when all was said and done
Blood on blood
One on one
And I'll be there for you 'til Kingdom come
Like blood on blood
Yeah


Now Bobby, he's an uptown lawyer
And Danny, he's a medicine man
Well me, I'm just the singer
In a long haired rock and roll band
Through the years and miles between us
It's been a long and lonely ride
But if I got that call in the dead of the night
I'd be right by your side
Blood on blood
Like blood on blood
Yeah
Just like blood (Blood on blood)
Blood on blood (Blood on blood)
Like blood (Just like blood)
New brothers, yeah

Like blood on blood
One on one
We'd still be standin' when all was said and done
Blood on blood
One on one
And I'll be there for you 'til Kingdom come
Like blood on blood

3 ContributorsWhen We Were Us Lyrics
We were young, unafraid
We were findin' our own way
There's no wind, there's no rain
In the eye of a hurricane

Every time you climb that mountain
There's another one left to climb
Don't go lookin' for tomorrow
Leavin' yesterday behind

Writin' every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us

We were one, born and raised
More than blood runs through these veins
Cuts can heal, scars will fade
What we had will never change

Seasons pass and time will move on
You don't ever have to let it go
You can only go so far now
'Til you're on your way back home

Writin' every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us

Memories are nothin' more than ghosts that we let in
Don't be afraid of them
Do you remember when?
Huh!


Writin' every page together

A storm is comin'
Let me be clear
Your days are numbered
The end is near
The walls around ya
Are closin' in
It's too late for prayin'
Sinner, meet sin

Once, I came across your border
Now they come to take me back
I sleep with one eye open
I don't make waves, I don't leave tracks
For my daughter and my three sons
It's the only life they've known
To me, it's my asylum
These stars and stripes, my home

Blood in the water
Who's jumpin' in?
The devil's made his final offer
Now the sharks are circlin'
Blood in the water
Our fates are sealed
The devil's greatest trick
Was just to say he wasn't real
Satan always used to love to say he wasn't real

Lies are in the forecast
The truth left with the tide
I hear your shadow sold your secrets
And he's gonna do some time
They say the noose fits like a necktie
Sir, you're gonna fit right in
With some old familiar faces
Sinner, meet sin

Blood in the water
Who's jumpin' in?
The devil's made his final offer
Now the sharks are circlin'
Blood in the water
Our fates are sealed
The devil's greatest trick
Was just to say he wasn't real
Satan always used to love to say he wasn't real

I'm no cable news reporter
They got nothin' new to say
I'm the voice of the new order
The star of Anarchy Today
I'm the comments you keep readin'
At the bottom of the page
I'm real power, I'm a patriot
I'm a Russian hack by trade
A Russian hack by trade

Blood in the water
Who's jumpin' in
The devil's made his final offer
Now the sharks are circlin'
Blood in the water

The devil's greatest trick
Was just to say he wasn't real

Now there's blood in the water

Seven days too soon
For the ones who have to make up
What we break up of their rules

Well, I saw Captain Kidd on Sunset
Tell his boys they're in command
While Chino danced a tango
With a broomstick in his hand
He said, "It's alright (Alright)
If you have a good time
It's alright (Alright)
If you wanna cross that line
Break on through to the other side"

(Let it rock) Let it rock (Let it go) let it go

With the night we're on the loose

We go down to the Broadway
Where everybody goes
To get up on their rockin' horse
Blast that radio

Yeah, I saw Roxie on the table

They'll give it up to the king of swing
Before it's time to go

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock, not just another grain of sand (That's what I am)
Wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier, but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

She's in the kitchen starin' out the window
So tired of livin' life in black and white
Right now, she's missin' those Technicolor kisses
When he turns down the lights

Lately, feelin' like a broken promise
In the middle, starin' down his doubt
There's only one thing in this world that he knows
He said forever and he'll never let her down

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock, not just another grain of sand (That's what I am)
Wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but I'm here to take a stand
Because we can

TV and takeout on a coffee table
Paper dishes, pour a glass of wine
Turn down the sound and move a little closer
And for the moment, everything is alright

I don't wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock, not just another grain of sand (That's what I am)
Wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier, but I'm here to take a stand
Because

We can, our love can move a mountain
We can, if you believe in we
We can, just wrap your arms around me
Can, we can

7 ContributorsHollow Man Lyrics
What do you sing when the song's been sung?
Who do you fight when the war is won?
What do you write when the book is done?
What do you sing when the song's been sung?

How do you pray until you find your prayer?
How can you care so much you just don't care?
How do you feel until the feelin' comes?
Until you love yourself, how can you love someone?

Here I am, a hollow man
Tellin' stories 'bout the promise of a promised land
Feel like a cheap bouquet of flowers, an' a one-man band
With my heart in hand, the hollow man

How does it work when the words don't come?
It's like pullin' the trigger on an empty gun
You can't makе it rain starin' at the sun
So you work at your work, until the work gets donе

Here I am, a hollow man
Tellin' stories 'bout the promise of a promised land
Feel like a holy roller's rosary on a one-night stand
With my heart in hand, the hollow man

I'm a blank page, clean slate
At night, I'll give my soul away
When nothin's left, I'll give you a smile
I got these chords that won't wait
I'm much too vain to masturbate
No sacrificin' substance for style
Awe, anyway, ha, I got you to smile

What do you see that your eyes don't see?
And what do you dream, now that you've sold your dreams?
And what do you sing when the song's been sung?
What do you sing when the song's been sung?

Here I am, the hollow man
Sellin' stories 'bout the promise of a promised land
I feel like a cheap bouquet of flowers, an' a one-man band
I'm just a holy roller's rosary on a one-night stand
With my heart in hand
I am
The hollow man

5 ContributorsComo Yo Nadie Te Ha Amado (This Ain’t A Love Song) Lyrics
Yo no vi las flores marchitar
Ni ese frío en tus ojos al mirar
No, no vi la realidad
Me ibas a dejar
Dicen que la vida, baby, no es como la ves
Para aprender hay que caer
Para ganar hay que perder
Lo di todo por ti

Lloré y lloré y juré que no iba a perderte
Traté y traté de negar este amor tantas veces, baby

Si mis lágrimas fueron en vano
Si al final yo te amé demasiado
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado

Cada hora, una eternidad
Cada amanecer, un comenzar;
Ilusiones nada más
Qué fácil fue soñar
Tantas noches de intimidad
Parecían no acabar
Nos dejamos desafiar
Y hoy nada es igual

Se que en verdad el amor al final siempre duele
No lo pude salvar y hoy voy a pagarlo con creces, baby

Si mis lágrimas fueron en vano
Si al final yo te amé demasiado
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado
Esta vez la pasión ha ganado
Y por eso sigo esperando
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado

Lloré y lloré y juré que no iba a perderte
Traté y traté de negar este amor tantas veces, baby

Si mis lágrimas fueron en vano
Si al final yo te amé demasiado
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado
Esta vez la pasión ha ganado
Y por eso sigo esperando
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado

Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado...
Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado...

Rumour has it that your daddy's coming down
He's gonna pay the rent
Tell me baby, is this as good as life is gonna get
It feels like there's a stranger who's standing in these shoes
But I know I can't lose me, cause then I'd be losing you
I know I promised baby
I would be the one to make our dreams come true
I ain't too proud of all the struggles
And the hard times we've been through
When this cold world comes between us
Please tell me you'll be brave
Because I can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away

If you don't love me - lie to me
Because baby you're the one thing I'll believe
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be
Right now if you don't love me baby - lie to me

Pour another cup of coffee
Babe i got something to say to you (I don't wanna die no more)
I ain't got the winning ticket
Not the one that's gonna pull us through (I don't wanna die no more)
No one said that it'd be easy
Let your old man take you home
But know that if you walk out on me that darling
I'd be gone

If you don't love me - lie to me
Because baby you're the one thing I'll believe
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be
Right now if you can't love me baby - lie to me
Baby, I can take it

It's a bitch, yeah life's a roller coaster ride
The ups and downs will make you scream sometimes
It's hard believing that the thrill is gone
But we got to go around again, so let's hold on

If you don't love me - lie to me
Because baby you're the one thing I'll believe
Let it all fall down around us
If that's what's meant to be
Right now if you can't love me baby - lie to me
Go on, lie to me
Baby, I can take it
Come on lie to me

Go on, lie to me
Go on, lie to me

Go on, lie to me

Tell me everything's gonna be alright
Come on, get me through the night

Waves
They take me down, no one here gonna save me now
Waves
They knock me off my feet

Now I understand, I see her face, I see her hand
And she waves, then fades away from me

We madе love and war
Got too far from the shore
Thought you wеre wavin', you were drownin'
Our footprints in the sand
Water through my hand
I just can't wrap my arms around you

They take me down, no one here gonna save me now

They knock me off my feet

Now I understand, I see her face, I see her hand
And she waves, then fades away from me

Put our boat out on the river
Never made it to the sea
I thought we were bein' reckless
You thought we were bein' free
Now I dream we're in the ocean
And I'm sinkin' as you drift away from me
Tide is risin', and I'm ridin'

Word just came from upstate, Joe
Lower the flag again
This time, it's Dayton, southwest Ohio
Last night, El Paso, Texas counted 22 dead

Soon, the brass will offer up their thoughts and prayers
Soon, there'll be protests in the street
And the media from out of town will chew it up and spit it out
And move on to the next one before we even grieve
Yeah, they'll move on to the next one before we even grieve

Some say we start to die on the day that we're born
But no one wants to live life on their knees
Maybe we start to die on the day that we're born
But we deserve to live life in-between

A husband kissed the cross that bears his Margie's name
And promises he'll see her once again
Won't see her children grow, won't see their love grow old
Last night, their dream became a nightmare and their nightmare has no end
Last night, their dream became a nightmare and their nightmare has no end

Some say we start to die on the day that we're born
But no one wants to live life on their knees
Maybe we start to die on the day that we're born
But we deserve to live life in-between

These days, it's hard to sleep when I lay my head down
What if it was your loved one layin' on the ground?
I'm left to think about, "What if, what now?"
Dear God, I wanna pray, but tonight, I have my doubts
When I think about those families now

If there's somethin' we can talk about, let's talk about it
If there's somethin' we can figure out, let's figure it out
If there's somethin' we can talk about, let's talk about it
If there's somethin' we can figure out, let's figure it out

Mistakes you know I've made a few
I took some shots and fell from time to time
Baby, you were there to pull me through
We've been around the block a time or two

Every time I look at you, baby, I see something new
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more
I don't want to sleep tonight, dreaming's just a waste of time
When I look at what my life's been coming to
I'm all about lovin' you

I've lived, I've loved, I've lost, I've paid some dues, baby

How do we win these losing
Games we play, words we say?
Cutting wounds, we know, they run so deep

Leave it all behind you
Or someday love will find you

(Only lonely, oh)
I can't stop hurting you
(Only lonely, oh)
But I can't stop loving you
(Only lonely, oh)
How much pain does it take?

It's getting sometimes I don't know
When to stop, when to go
Sometimes we're so afraid to let it show
A stolen kiss so out of place
It wipes the smile right off your face
And when those feelings start
We let them go, let them go

Games we play, words we say
Cutting wounds that run so deep
Leave it all behind you
Or someday love will find you

(Only lonely, oh)
I can't stop hurting you
(Only lonely, oh)
But I can't stop loving you
(Only lonely, oh)
So tell me, babe
How much pain can you take
Before your heart breaks?
Before your heart breaks, yeah

I got this time bomb ticking, in my head
This time I think she's gonna blow
How can I say get away
When I just can't let go?

Games we play, words we say
Cutting wounds that run so
Leave it all behind you
Or someday love will find you

(Only lonely, oh)
I can't stop hurting you
(Only lonely, oh)
But I can't stop loving you
(Only lonely, oh)
So tell me, babe, how much pain can you take
Before your heart breaks?

[Song 58: Do What You Can (Single Edit)]
8 ContributorsDo What You Can (Single Edit) Lyrics
Tonight they're shutting down the borders
And they boarded up the schools
Small towns are rollin' up their sidewalks
One less paycheck comin' through
I know you're feelin' kinda nervous
We're all a little bit confused
Nothing's the same, this ain't a game
We gotta make it through

When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

The chicken farm from Arkansas brought workers PPE
Not before five hundred more had succumbed to this disease
Honest men and honest women workin' for an honest wage
I got a hundred point one fever, and we still got bills to pay

When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

They built a hospital on East Meadow in Central Park last night
Doctors, nurses, truckers, grocery store clerks manning the front lines
I saw a Red Cross on the Hudson
They turned off the Broadway lights
Another ambulance screams by
There by the grace of God go I

Although I'll keep my social distance
What this world needs is a hug
Until we find the vaccination
There's no substitute for love
So love yourself and love your family
Love your neighbor and your friend
Ain't it time we loved a stranger?
They're just a friend you ain't met yet

When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

[Song 59: Beautiful Drug]
9 ContributorsBeautiful Drug Lyrics
Tear off your mask, no need to hide
There's a prescription that no doctor can prescribe
Can’t walk on water, down on your knees
You enter numbers, step right up, the stuff is guaranteed

Ain't got the fever, fever got me
No need to call an ambulance, you got the remedy

Love is a beautiful drug
Love is a beautiful
A mystery that sets you free, it's what you want, it’s all we need
Love is a beautiful drug
A beautiful drug

The poets verse can not describe
This kind of wonder that mystifies
Love is the drink to healing thirst
Hear my confession, I don't even need a church

Love is a beautiful drug
I'm talking 'bout, love is a beautiful
A mystery that sets you free, it's what you want, it's all we need
Love is a beautiful drug
A beautiful drug

It pulls you in just like a tide
The deeper deep, a higher high
The taste, the touch, the stuff of dreams
The paradise that's in between
Sweet honey of another hit
You'd almost bite through your own lip
The thorny rose that makes you bleed
A kind of hurt that makes you scream

Love is a beautiful drug
I’m talking ’bout, love is a beautiful
A mystery that sets you free, it's what you want, it’s all we need
Love is a beautiful drug
A beautiful drug

A beautiful drug
A beautiful drug

Hey, hey
Hey, hey

In my rear view mirror
My life is gettin' clearer
The sunset sighs and slowly disappears
These trinkets once were treasure
Life changes like the weather
You grow up, grow old, or you hit the road 'round here

So I drive (Drive, drive)
Watchin' white lines passin' by
With my plastic dashboard Jesus
Waitin' there to greet us

Hey, hey
I finally found my way
Say goodbye to yesterday
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on the lost highway
Yeah, I'm bustin' loose, I'm lettin' go
Out on this open road
It's Independence Day on this lost highway

Hey, hey
Hey, hey

I don't know where I'm goin'
But I know where I've been
I'm afraid of goin' back again

So I drive (Drive, drive)
Years and miles are flyin' by
And waitin' there to great us
Is my plastic dashboard Jesus

Hey, hey

Say goodbye to yesterday
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on the lost highway
Yeah, I'm bustin' loose, I'm lettin' go
Out on this open road
It's Independence Day on this lost highway

Hey, hey

Oh, patron saint of lonely souls, tell this boy which way to go
Guide the car, you got the keys, farewell to mediocrity
Kickin' off the cruise-control and turnin' up the radio
Got just enough religion and a half tank of gas, come on
Let's go (Go, go, go)

I finally found my way
Say goodbye to yesterday
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on the lost highway
I'm bustin' loose, I'm lettin' go
When I'm out on this open road
It's Independence Day on this lost highway

Hey, hey

Okay, we ready?
Just about
Let's go

Hey God, I'm just a little man, I got a wife and family
I almost lost the house, I bought into the dream
We're barely holdin' on when I'm in way too deep
We're two paychecks away from living out on the streets

She's a workin' single mom, like a saint, she don't complain
She never says a word, but she thinks that she's to blame
Her son just got convicted, he blew some cop away
She did her best to raise him, but the world got in the way

Hey God
Tell me what the hell is goin' on
It seems like all the good shit's gone
It keeps on gettin' harder hangin' on
But hey, hey, hey, hey God
There's nights, you know, I wanna scream
These days, you're even harder to believe
I know how busy you must be
But hey, hey, hey, hey God
Do you ever think about me?

Born into the ghetto in 1991
Just a happy child playing 'neath the summer sun
A vacant lots' his playground, by twelve he's got a gun
The odds are bet against him, Junior don't make twenty-one

Hey God
Tell me what the hell is goin' on
It seems like all the good shit's gone
It keeps on gettin' harder hangin' on
But hey, hey, hey, hey God
There's nights, you know, I wanna scream
These days, you're even harder to believe
I know how busy you must be
But hey, hey, hey, hey God
Do you ever think about me?


I get down on my knees
I'm gonna try this thing your way
I've seen a dyin' man too proud to beg
Spit on his own grave
Was he too gone to save?
Oh, did you even know his name?
Are you the one to blame?
Ha, I got something to say

Hey God
Tell me what the hell is goin' on
It seems like all the good shit's gone
It keeps on gettin' harder hangin' on

There's nights, you know, I wanna scream

I don't need no license
To sign on no line
And I don't need no preacher
To tell me you're mine
I don't need no diamonds
Don't need no new bride
I just need you, baby
To look me in the eye
Well, I know they have a hard time
Your daddy don't approve
But I don't need your daddy
Tellin' us what we should do

Now there's a million questions
I could ask about our lives
But I only need one answer
To get me through the night

And I say, baby, can you tell me just where we fit in?
I call it love, they call it livin' in sin
(Livin' in sin)
Is it you and me or just this world we live in?
We're livin' on love, they say we're livin' in sin

Oh woah, oh

Is it right for both our parents
Who fight it out most nights
Then pray for God's forgiveness
When they both turn out the lights
Or wear that ring of diamonds
When your heart is made of stone
You can talk but still say nothing
You stay together but alone

Or is it right to hold you
And kiss your lips goodnight
But I promise it forever
If you sign it on the dotted line

Oh, baby, can you tell me just where we fit in?
I call it love they call it livin' in sin
(Livin' in sin)
Oh, is it you and me or just this world we live in?
We're livin' on love, they say we're livin' in sin

Woah oh, woah
Come on


Hey, baby, can you tell me just where we fit in?
I call it love, they call it livin' in sin
Oh, is it you and me or just this world we live in?
We're livin' on love, or are we livin' in sin?
I don't know just where
Sometimes it scares me


I don't know where to begin
(Livin' in sin)
I don't know where we fit in
Livin' in sin, oh

Fahrenheit risin' up, higher than high
Pressure's buildin' up, sparks are gonna fly
I know where this is goin' when I look into your eyes
I know where this is goin' when I look into your eyes

Sweet sweat's rollin' down the middle of your spine
Bodies move together, perfect rhythm and time
Baby say my name, I'll write yours in the sky
Higher than a rocket on the Fourth of July
Higher than a rocket on the Fourth of July

It's good, it's good, it's good to be alive

It's a full-time job, the work's never done
24/7, it's a labor of love
Yeah, everything I got, it's all about us
Baby, this ain't workin', it's a labor of love
Baby, this ain't workin', it's a labor of love

Only fools count treasure in silver and gold
I don't want for nothin' that these hands can't hold
If you need somethin' done, put it on the list
And if I need some sugar, I'll get it from your lips

I know every curve, but it's never the same
If love is a fire, I'd go down in those flames
I wanna die in your arms, hearin' you say my name
I wanna die in your arms, hearin' you say my name
I wanna die in your arms, hearin' you say my name

When these hands won't strum and I can't find the chords
And my voice don't wanna sing
When my feet say dance, but I can't find the floor
Will you just lie here with me?

Will your eyes catch mine, then linger too long?
Will you still let me bring you your tea?
When your mind starts to wander, can I come along?
Is there someplace that you'd rather be?

I wrote you a song, almost afraid to sing it
How could it ever be beautiful enough?
I can't give you the ocean or the sky so blue
The wonders of thе world, they don't compare to you
I did the only thing I know how to do

I wrotе you a song
I wrote you a song

If I brought you flowers, in a couple of days
The petals would all fall away
To give you forever, for worse or for better
Something that won't ever fade

I wrote you a song, now that it's done
It's simple what I wanna say
This scribbled love letter
We wrote it together
I promise my heart's on the page

I wrote you a song, almost afraid to sing it
How could it ever be beautiful enough?
I can't give you the ocean or the sky so blue
The wonders of the world, they don't compare to you
I did the only thing I know how to do

I wrote you a song

Come in and leave your mind open
It's time we let love in
Mother, Father, I am broken
Barely breathin', but I'm hopin'
There's forgiveness for my sins

I had a dream last night
And in that dream, I lost my sight
Life left me deaf, dumb, and blind, woke up to realize
We're still asleep with open eyes

We are buildin' this house of love
Buildin' this house, buildin' this house

This is the people's house
From sea to shinin' sеa

Thеse halls are our city streets
No wreckin' ball is gonna knock it down
Nobody's gonna come to steal the keys
This is the people's house
The house of you and me

Time for the turnin' of the page
It's time to say goodbye
Old ways have changed
No crime to look out for each other
Father, mother, sister, brother
Can't keep fightin' one another

We are buildin' this house of love
Buildin' this house, buildin' this house

This is the people's house
From sea to shinin' sea

Nobody's gonna come to steal the keys

I wasn't born a man of privilege
But I'm privileged just the same
No rain will wash away the stain
No truth can hide us from the shame
Until we all believe in change

Buildin' this house, buildin' this house

This is the people's house
From sea to shinin' sea
The Rocky Mountain built these walls

There ain't nothin' gonna get in my way

In a time, in a place
In a world they forgot
Lives the heart of me
A part that just won't die
Just a boy, not a man
Sent to war in a land
They said we'd fight for their freedom
But I felt like a hired hand

Sometimes I have to find my way
Sometimes I have to get away

Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road

Working hard, for a pass
Got the night, make it last
It was a night to remember
All my life, I would never forget
In a bar, breathing smoke
Snorting whiskey, drinking coke
It was a time when no one would die
And there wasn't a care

Sometimes I wish it was that way
'Cause sometimes I have to get away

Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road


This guy turns me around, and he's pointing up the stairs
I found myself in her doorway, but there wasn't anybody there
She walked in the room with nothing on but a red light, aw-huh
And with a smile she got so close to me
She whispered something 'bout midnight
I didn't understand a word she said
But it felt so good
She knew that I didn't have any money
But baby I knew she would

Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road

Happiness, it's been no friend to me
But forever after ain't what it's all cracked up to be
Yeah, I had a taste, you were my fantasy
But I almost lost my faith when I hit reality

I don't need no guru to tell me what to do
When you're feeling like a headline on
Yesterday's news
Come on, come on, come on

Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel I've been dangling from a hang-man's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right
Something like you

Loneliness has found a home in me
My suitcase and guitar are my only family
I've tried to need someone, like they needed me
Well I opened up my heart, but all i did was bleed

I don't need no lover, just to get screwed
They don't make a bandage, that's going to cover my bruise
Come on, come on, come on

Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel I've been dangling from a hang-man's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right
Something like you
Come on, come on, come on

Pull me under (help I'm falling)
Through my veins
To a place
Where i feel no pain
Be the pillow under my head (night is calling)
Cover me when I'm in your bed
Take me higher than I've ever been(feels like I'm flying)
Take me down and back again
Come to me, be my disguise (Christ, I'm dying)
Open your coat, let me crawl inside
Come on, come on, come on

Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel I've been dangling from a hang-man's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use

And the sidewalk soldiers sing the midnight blues
While the old men recite their storylines
'Bout when I was young like you

We were cruisin' to the backbeat

Had a date with the girl next door
You know it made her daddy crazy
It only made her want him more
But they weren't looking for trouble
That boy didn't want a fight, not tonight
So she headed out through her bathroom window
What her daddy didn't know was gonna be alright

She said (Oh yeah)
We're cruisin' to the backbeat

And ooh, we were wild, wild in the streets

But you know it ain't so bad
Just like a girl who looks so happy
When inside she's so, so sad
In here, we got this code of honor

(Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na)

Drop your shield and lay your sword down
Your weapons are your voices
You will know the war is over
When the weary soul rejoices

You've come too far to turn back now
Let me show ya how the walls come crumblin' down

Make some noise, strike up the band
Pull the paint off of the ceilin'
Sing down the walls of Jericho
One more time, with feelin’

(Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na)

Wake the echo, call the thunder
Tell them we’ve only just begun
No amen, no hallelujah
This is a song for everyone

Make some noise, strike up the band
Pull the paint off of the ceilin'
Sing down the walls of Jericho
One more time, with feelin’
One more time, with feelin', boys
Long as we're still breathin'
Sing down the walls of Jericho
One more time, with feelin’

[Song 73: Captain Crash and the Beauty Queen from Mars]
13 ContributorsCaptain Crash and the Beauty Queen from Mars Lyrics
Dressed up for a big date
Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July, now
A car crash with a suitcase and a painted face
She was one of a kind
She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella
And roller skates in bed

He rides the greyhound from his hometown
When he comes around, 'cause they don't let him drive, now
Mixed up as a milkshake
But make no mistake
Crash is looking like a star

You and me
We're invincible together
We can be oh so tragical, whatever

Dressed up just like Ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars

Share a toothpick, trading lipstick
Watching traffic for days at the diner
Holding hands, making big plans
Playing Superman, he was wearing eyeliner
Another local legend and his longtime lucky charm

You and me
We're invincible together
We can be oh so tragical, whatever

All dressed up like Ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars

They're drunk on love as you can get
Getting high on lust and cigarettes
Living life with no regrets
At least they're gonna try to fly


You and me
We're invincible together
We can be oh so tragical, whatever

We're Sid and Nancy
Fred and Ginger
Clyde and Bonnie
Liz and Richard
Kurt and Courtney
Bacall and Bogie
Joltin' Joe and Ms. Monroe
Here's Captain Crash and the beauty queen from Mars (Yeah, that's you and me)

Still, it's so hard for her to notice
That I've tried hard to be straight
There's nothing left I can say
If only she would look my way, hey-hey, but

I dream of when she'll be mine
I dream of crossing that line
And holding her so tender
Dreamin' it could come true
So many things I would do
If only you'd give me a chance, oh

She wears on her chest
When Daddy comes home

'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
Well, the kids don't eat
And the dog can't sleep
There's no escape from the music
In the whole damn street
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
'Cause she's playing all night

Come on and squeeze me
Come on and tease me like you do
I'm so in love with you"

10 ContributorsJust Older Lyrics
Hey, man, it's been a while
Do you remember me?
When I hit these streets I was seventeen
A little wild, a little green
Been up and down and in between
After all these years and miles of memories
I'm still chasin' dreams

But I ain't lookin' over my shoulder

I like the bed I'm sleepin' in
And just like me, it's broken in
It's not old, just older
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
The skin I'm in is alright with me
It's not old, just older

It's good to see your face
You ain't no worse for wear
Breathin' that California air
When we took on the world
We were young and brave
We got secrets that we'll take to the grave

Standin' here shoulder to shoulder

I like the bed I'm sleepin' in
And just like me, it's broken in
It's not old, just older
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
The skin I'm in is alright with me
It's not old, just older

I'm not old enough to sing the blues
But I've worn a hole in the soles of these shoes
You can roll the dice 'til they call your bluff
But you can't win until you're not afraid to lose
Yeah


Well, I look in the mirror
I don't hate what I see
There's a few more lines starin' back at me
Now the night has grown a little bit colder
Hey man, I gotta run
Now you take care
If you see Coach T, tell him I've cut my hair
I've kept my faith
I still believe I'm just
Ha

I like the bed I'm sleepin' in
And just like me, it's broken in
It's not old, just older
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
The skin I'm in's alright with me
It's not old, just older

Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Song 78: (It’s Hard) Letting You Go]
5 Contributors(It’s Hard) Letting You Go Lyrics
It ain't no fun lying down to sleep
And there ain't no secrets left for me to keep
I wish the stars up in the sky
Would all just call in sick
And the clouds would take the moon out
On some one-way trip
I drove all night down streets that wouldn't bend
But somehow they drove me back here once again
To the place I lost at love - the place I lost my soul
I wish I'd just burned down this place that we called home
It would all have been so easy
If you'd only made me cry
And told me how you're leaving me
To some organ grinder's lullaby

It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart
It's hard letting you go

Now the sky, it shines a different kind of blue
And the neighbor's dog don't bark like he used to
Well - me, these days
I just miss you - it's the nights that i go insane
Unless you're coming back for me
That's one thing i know that won't change


Now some tarot card shark said i'll draw you a heart
And we'll find you somebody else new
But I made my last trip to those carnival lips
When I bet all that I had on you
 x2

It's been 4,000 hours
200 days
I curse every minute
Since you ran away
It's hard
Letting you go
It's hard, so hard, it's hard, so hard
It's hard letting you go
Letting you go

[Song 79: Seeds]
7 ContributorsSeeds Lyrics
There's a deep crack in the sidewalk
Near the park bench on my street
If you don't trip, you'll walk by it
There's a whole world we don't see

You don't have to fix what is broken
You only get better at copin'
The road don't always know where it's goin'
We keep rollin' and rollin' and rollin'

We're seeds tryin' to find our place in the weeds
Bustin' through the cracks in the street
We keep reachin' for light, reachin' for light
We're seeds, even if we fall like the leaves
Bustin' through the cracks in the street
We keep reachin' for light, reachin' for light

There's a sadness in the seasons
Like the friends who come and go
The heartbreak, the glory
Each writin' their story
We'll never get to know

Be happy for the tears that you're cryin'
The cracks are where we let all the light in
Put yourself out there in the open
Just keep growin' and growin' and growin'

We're seeds tryin' to find our place in the weeds
Bustin' through the cracks in the street
We keep reachin' for light, reachin' for light
We're seeds, even if we fall like the leaves
Bustin' through the cracks in the street
We keep reachin' for light, reachin' for light


Be happy for the tears that you're cryin'
Cracks are where we let all the light in
Put yourself out there in the open
Just keep growin' and growin' and growin'

We're seeds tryin' to find our place in the weeds
Bustin' through the cracks in the street
We keep reachin' for light, reachin' for light
We're seeds, even if we fall like the leaves
Bustin' through the cracks in the street
We keep reachin' for light, reachin' for light

[Song 80: Real Love]
4 ContributorsReal Love Lyrics
They're puttin' up the chairs to close, she let me settle up my tab
I told her, "Button up, it's cold, I ain't too drunk to hail us a cab
We can get a cup of coffee but unless you gotta get back home"

Sittin' 'cross the table, a gypsy couldn't read her mind
I took her hand and told her I just wanna crawl into her eyes
She shook her head and said, "It's cruel," cool is just a cheap disguise

Have you ever known a real love?
The kinda love that makes you feel love?
No, this ain't let's-make-a-deal, love
Make an angel give his wings up
It makes you guilty 'cause you want more
If it's a kiss that you would die for
Feels like you're fallin' through the stars
If it can break your heart
It's real love

We drank that muddy pot of coffee, it was mornin' when I walked her home
I never been this lonely, lyin' in this bed alone
Her words still ringin' in my head, her sad eyes sunk me like a stone

Have you ever known a real love?
The kind of love that makes you feel love?
No, this ain't let's-make-a-deal love
Make an angel give his wings up
It makes you guilty 'cause you want more
If it's a kiss that you would die for
Feels like you're fallin' through the stars
If it can break your heart
It's real love

I put on the same shirt and I ran out the door
Stole a fistful of roses from the sidewalk store
Just my heart in my hand, I had nothin' to prove
Standin' up on her front step, calling to her window

Have you ever known a real love?
The kinda love that makes you feel love?
No, this ain't let's-make-a-deal, love
Make an angel give his wings up
It makes you guilty 'cause you want more
If it's a kiss that you would die for
Feels like you're fallin' through the stars
If it can break your heart
It's real love

Feels like you're falling through the stars
If it can break your heart
It's real love

Ain't nobody riding shotgun
In the world tonight
And when you spit, you better mean it
You better make 'em all believe it
If you're gonna be the one, woah-oh

But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will curse you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to

So you wanna be the big time
Some people gonna drag you down
There's no living in the backseat (Backseat)
If you're gonna drive through town
And when you pray for independence
Boy, you better stand your ground
You gotta give it all you got now
Or you might get shot down
You fight hard until the battle is won, woah-oh

Stick to your guns
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
You can go for the trigger
But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will curse you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, you know that I been through it
I got the scars to prove it
You fight hard and the battle is yours, woah-oh

Stick to your guns
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
You can go for the trigger
But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will curse you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to
It's only if you have to

But stick to your guns, woah-oh-oh-oh

So you wanna be a cowboy
Well, you know it's more than just a ride

It's a hot night, the natives are restless
We're sweatin' by the light of the moon
There's a voodoo mojo brewin' at the go-go
That could knock a witch off her broom

Make our way into the bump and the grind

So I stop to give her a light

Margarita had me feelin' alright
Just might be that I found religion

Wish I could fill your empty
Right that wrong, make it fair

Wish I could steal your heart
Breach the sky with your prayer

Heal where hands can't reach
Hold what no one can touch

Love can ease your burden

Be the rest for your tired

Love can forgive the hurt
Hear what can't be heard
Raise what you can't lift up

9 ContributorsWithout Love Lyrics
She wasn't young, but still a child
There was still innocence in faded smiles
She called to me as I passed her by
Lady of the night looked in my eyes

She said, "I've been through some changes
But one thing always stayed the same"

Without love, there's nothing without love
And nothing else can get you through the night
'Cause nothing else feels right without love, woah

I saw a man down on Lonely Street
A broken man who looked like me
And no one knows the pain that he's been livin'
He lost his love and still hasn't forgiven

He said, "I've been through some changes
But one thing always stays the same"

Without love, there's nothing without love
And nothing else can get you through the night
'Cause nothing else feels right without love
There's nothing without love
Nothing else but love can burn as bright
'Cause nothing would mean nothing without love, woah

I see my life
Some things I took for granted
Love's passed me by
So many second chances
I was afraid
I won't be afraid no more

Without love, there's nothing without love
Nothing else can get you through the night
Nothing else feels right without love
There's nothing without love
And nothing else but love can burn as bright
'Cause nothing would mean nothing without love

There's nothing without love
And nothing without love
Nothing without love

13 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsWhat Do You Got? Lyrics
Everybody wants somethin', just a little more
We're makin' a livin', and what we're livin' for
A rich man or a poor man, a pawn or a king
You can live on the street, you can rule the whole world
But it don't mean one damn thing

What do you got if you ain't got love?
Whatever you got, it just ain't enough
You're walkin' the road, but you're goin' nowhere
You're trying to find your way home, but there's no one there
Who do you hold in the dark of night?
You wanna give up, but it's worth the fight
Can have all the things that you've been dreamin' of

If you ain't got someone, you're afraid to lose
Everybody needs just one, someone to tell them the truth
Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I still believe
I believe in hope
I believe the change can get us up off our knees

What do you got if you ain't got love?
Whatever you got, it just ain't enough
You're walkin' the road, but you're goin' nowhere
You're trying to find your way home, but there's no one there
Who do you hold in the dark of night?
You wanna give up, but it's worth the fight
Can have all the things that you've been dreamin' of

If you ain't got love
It's all just keepin' score
If you ain't got love
What the hell we doin' it for?

I don't wanna have to talk about it
How many songs you gotta sing about it?
How long you gonna live without it?
Why does someone somewhere have to doubt it?
Someday you'll figure it out


What do you got if you ain't got love?
Whatever you got, it just ain't enough
You're walkin' the road, but you're goin' nowhere
You're trying to find your way home, but there's no one there
Who do you hold in the dark of night?
You wanna give up, but it's worth the fight
Can have all the things that you've been dreamin' of

If you ain't got love
It's all just keepin' score
If you ain't got love
What the hell we doin' it for?

Ah, take a look around you, yeah, the sky is fallin'
Sinners, say your prayers, this train is off the tracks
Nothin' is forever when tomorrow's callin'
Dancin' with the devil to get one day back, I'm

(Hey) Not afraid of burnin' bridges
(Hey) 'Cause I know they're gonna light my way
(Hey) Like a phoenix, from the ashes
Welcome to the future, it's a new day

We don't run
I'm standin' my ground
We don't run

There's fire in the sky, there's thunder on the mountain
Bless each tear and this dirt I was born in
Run
We don't run, we don't run

Aw, take me to the banks of your muddy water
Where the flesh and blood and the spirit meet
Only takes your touch for me to find salvation
You're the only reason that I still believe, I'm

[Song 88: Hearts Breaking Even]
4 ContributorsHearts Breaking Even Lyrics
It's a cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold night tonight
And I can't get you off of my mind
God knows I've tried
Did I throw away the best part of my life
When I cut you off
Did I cut myself with the same damn knife
Hide my tears in the pouring rain
Had my share of hurt and pain
Don't say my name, run away, cause it's all in vain

My heart's breaking even, now there's no use we even try
Hey I cried, yeah I lied, hell I almost died
We've both got our reasons
Let's just fold the cards and say good-bye
It's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight

It's been a long, long, long, long, long time
Since I've had your love here in my hands
We didn't understand it, we couldn't understand it
But, nothing's fair in love and hate
You lay it all down and walk away, before it's too late
We danced all night as the music played
The sheets got tangled in the mess we made
There in the stains, we remain
No one left to blame


Go on, get on with your life
Yeah and I'll get on with mine
Broken hearts can't call the cops
Yeah - it's the perfect crime
Twisting and turning the night keeps me yearning
I'm burning alive
I'm paying the price again
But I'll see the light again


Go on, get up
Go on, walk out the door
Say you don't care about me anymore
That's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight
I don't love you like
Not like we used to do
Tell me I would hold on to get better than you
You, hah
Two hearts breaking even tonight

If you were born again tomorrow
(Born again tomorrow)

This ain't a test, no, it's a warnin'
Ain't gonna say the sky is fallin'
You gotta read between the lines
Stop waitin' for a sign
Who's gonna live your life?

Yeah, you don't have to look back to see where we are
The future's lookin' brighter than a handful of stars
You gotta hold on, hold on
Be strong

If you were born again tomorrow (Woah-oh)
Would you live your life like yesterday?
If you were born again tomorrow (Woah-oh)
I wouldn't live my life any other way

Don't have to end up where you started
Heaven loves the broken-hearted
You learn from your mistakes
Bones grow stronger where they break
Who says that scars don't fade?

Well you don't have to look back to see where we are
The future's lookin' brighter than a handful of stars
You gotta hold on, hold on
You gotta be strong

If you were born again tomorrow (Woah-oh)

I wouldn't live my life any other way

Any other way (Woah-oh)
Born again tomorrow (Woah-oh)
If you were born again tomorrow (Woah-oh)
Born again tomorrow (Woah-oh)

[Song 90: Say It Isn’t So]
11 ContributorsSay It Isn’t So Lyrics
I just can't believe it was all a lie
No man in the moon, just a big light in the sky
I hear Disneyland might lose Mickey Mouse
In some giant hostile corporate shake up
Tell me, it's a nightmare, please wake me up
Say it isn't so

I found a book of matches to some place we've never been
How come you hang the phone up the minute I walk in?
Last night I had this dream that I was losin' you
I woke up in a cold sweat shakin'
Rescue me, my heart is breakin'

Say it isn't so (Tell me it's not true)
Say it isn't so (I believe in you)
Tell me it's a lie (I don't need no proof)
Say everything's alright (Couldn't be, not you)
Say it isn't so

Superman don't fly, they did all with strings
Elvis Presley died, they deep-fried the King
Like some tacky cheesy bathin' beauty
Dancin' on the beach in a bad B-movie

Say it isn't so (Tell me it's not true)
Say it isn't so (I believe in you)
Tell me it's a lie (I don't need no proof)
Say everything's alright (Couldn't be, not you)
Say it isn't so (Don't give up on me)
Say it isn't so (Don't give up on you)
Get me through the night (We'll make it through)
Make everything alright (Couldn't be, not you)
Say it isn't so


Say it isn't so (Tell me it's not true)
Say it isn't so (I believe in you)
Tell me it's a lie (I don't need no proof)
Say everything's alright (Couldn't be, not you)
Say it isn't so (Don't give up on me)
Say it isn't so (Don't give up on you)
Get me through the night (We'll make it through)
Make everything alright (Couldn't be, not you)
Say it isn't so

[Song 91: Shine]
5 ContributorsShine Lyrics
Here in the dark
Alone with the stars
Just the man in the moon
And the beat of my heart
The curl of your lip
The soft of your skin
The silence that sings
Your song on the wind

The wildest dream can not compare
To the simple truth of you standing there

There ain't no sight nor sound
That makes my world go round
I come alive
With you by my side
I can't get close enough
Whenever I feel your touch
Nothin' lights up my sky
Like watchin' you shine
Watchin' you shine

A box for your dreams
A book for your heart
Take a stick and a stone
And we'll make a spark
In your eyes I can see
A thousand forevers
We started this fire
We're buildin' together

Tomorrow seems so far from here
Take my hand, I'll take you there

There ain't no sight nor sound
That makes my world go round
I come alive with you by my side
I can't get close enough
Whenever I feel your touch
Nothing lights up my sky
Like watchin' you shine
I'm watchin' you shine
Watchin' you shine


The wildest dreams cannot compare
To the simple truth of you standing there

There ain't no sight nor sound
That makes my world go round
I come alive with you by my side
I can't get close enough
Whenever I feel your touch
Nothing lights up my sky
Like watchin' you shine
I'm watchin' you shine
Watchin' you shine
Watchin' you shine

[Song 92: I Want You]
7 ContributorsI Want You Lyrics
The last time that I saw her
Was the night she said goodbye
She said that love's a stranger
And it's sure to pass you by, yes she did
As she packed up her belongings
Baby wouldn't look me in the eye
But I could see a tear roll
Off her face
As we both tried so hard
Not to cry she said

I never wanted the stars
I never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
Cause I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you

I tried so hard to remember
Where when how why love went away
I tried to drown myself in pity
But your memory kept calling your name, yes it did
I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings
All the things that my money brings
And the servants to paint the skies blue
And I worked so hard seven days a week
Built a fortress for your heart to keep
If I could I'd wrap these words up for you

I never wanted the stars
I never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
Because I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you

I may have built for you a dream house
But never thought you were alone
I filled the party up with company
But never made our house a home
All I got is my guitar these chords and the truth
All I got is my guitar, but all I want is you

[Song 93: Living in Paradise]
6 ContributorsLiving in Paradise Lyrics
You and me been on some ride
Held off the night 'til the sunrise
Saw the world through a child's eyes
Been in love for a long time
You and me tore the walls down
And built them up in a new town
I used to sing for the whole crowd
Now, every song is for you, now

Castles may crumble
And fall to the sea

Yeah, we're livin' in paradise
Yeah, we're livin' in paradise

Seasons come and the seasons go
We planted seeds and we watched them grow
We wrote the book on the highs and lows
We figured out what we didn't know
You give me faith when I'm losing hope
We may have bent but we never broke
The rain can fall and the wind will blow
The sun'll shine anywhere we go

I can't remember
Before you and me

Yeah, we're livin' in paradise
Yeah, we're livin' in paradise
Summer's gone, it's been a long September
Nothin' matters, long as we're together
Yeah, we're livin' in paradise

Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
From the embers, we will rise
And we'll light up the sky

Yeah, we're livin' in paradise
Yeah, we're livin' in paradise
Summer's gone, it's been a long September
Nothin' matters, long as we're together
Yeah, we're livin' in paradise

Livin' in paradise
Livin' in paradise

We will not back down (No Apology)
We are not afraid (No Apology)

Let's start this from the happy ending
Just another white trash train-track kid
Fighting for survival
Trying not to do like his daddy did
Double down the devil at three-card Monte
No apology, he just knew when to quit
Push your luck, say your prayers
Make believe you don't care
Take a chance, sometimes it's all you need

You wanna start a personal revolution
Think of living somebody else’s life
You can lie about retribution
But there ain’t no fire in your lover’s eyes
Seems like everybody’s selling you dreams ‘round here
But no one’s buying and it’s closing time
Light the fuse, make your break, there’s no time left to waste
Baby just like freedom, nothin’s free

[Song 95: Brothers in Arms]
7 ContributorsBrothers in Arms Lyrics
Ever since I was a young boy
Before I'd ever know who I am
My father said, "You gotta walk before you can crawl
So you can run as soon as you can stand
So you can run as soon as you can"

Now if every breathin' day is a lesson
I been writin' this before I could read
When mama said, "Son, don't let this hard world
Do what it's doin' to me
Don't let it do what it's done to me"

It's a hard rain that's gonna fall on the city
Still a hard rain that's gonna fall on the farm

There's no seventh day in a world without pity
There's no ball and chain, but the change didn't come
Where's my better days? Where's my Jesus saves?
Where's someone to say
"We gotta hang on"?
We're brothers in arms

Down in southern Alabama
It's "yes sir", "no ma'am", "thank you", and "please"
But don't you step outta line, don't rewrite or define
What it means to see a man take a knee
Okay, oh, say can you see

It's a hard rain that's gonna fall on the city
Still a hard rain that's gonna fall on the farm

There's no seventh day in a world without pity
There's no ball and chain, but the change didn't come
Where's my better days? Where's my Jesus saves?
Where's someone to say
"We gotta hang on"?
We're brothers in arms
We're brothers in arms

It's a hard rain that's gonna fall on the city
Still a hard rain that's gonna fall on the farm
It's a hard rain that's gonna fall on the city
Still a hard rain, don't give a damn who you are

There's no seventh day in a world without pity
There's no ball and chain, but the change didn't come
Where's my better days? Where's my Jesus saves?
Where's someone to say
"We gotta hang on"?
We're brothers in arms
We're brothers in arms

[Song 96: Two Story Town]
8 ContributorsTwo Story Town Lyrics
One, two
One, two

I couldn't sleep, took a walk down Second Avenue
Sick of dreamin' dreams that never come true
On a one-way street and I know where its leadin' to

There's a for sale sign on the front door of the city hall
The subway line got graffiti crawlin' off the wall
I could take a hit but I ain't gonna take the fall

Woah-oh (Do, do, do-do-do)
That's just one side of the story
Woah-oh no (Do, do, do-do-do)
In this two story town

It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I'm gonna take my car and drive out of this two story town
The same old shit is goin' 'round
I'm going down (Down), down, down, down, down
In a two story town

There's a girl that I sleep with, got ecstasy eyes
He promised her roses and American pie
I called her and my demons
I kissed them both goodbye
(Bye-bye)

Oh-oh (Do, do, do-do-do)
Seven days of Monday mornin'
Woah-oh-oh (Do, do, do-do-do)
In a two story town

It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I'm gonna take my car and drive out of this two story town
The same old shit is goin' 'round
I'm going down (Down), down, down, down, down
In a two story town

One shot to make a move now
The ghosts are callin' me out


And me, I'm just one story
In a two story town
But you're never gonna find me in the lost and found

It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I'm gonna take my car and drive out of this two story town
The same old shit is goin' 'round
I'm going down (Down), down, down, down, down
It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I'm gonna take my horse and ride off of this merry-go-round
I won't give in and I won't back down
Ain't going down (Down), down, down, down, down
Never going down (Down), down, down, down, down
I ain't going down (Down), down, down, down, down
In a two-story town
In this two story town

Watch me
Huh
(Ooh)
(Do, do, do-do-do)

Bounce, bounce nothing's going to keep me down
Bounce, bounce stand up, shout it out
Bounce, bounce I play hard, I play to win
Count me out, count me in
I'll be bouncing back again

This is no game, I play it hard
Kicked around, cut, stitched and scarred
I'll take the hit but not the fall
I know no fear, still standing tall
You can call it karma, call it luck
Me, I just don't give a fu-fu-fu-fu—

Bounce, bounce nothing's going to keep me down

Bounce, bounce I play hard, I play to win
Count me out, count me in

In your face, I call your bluff
It ain't karma, it ain't luck

This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
A silent prayer for faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like the open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for ones who stood their ground
It's for Tommy and Gina, who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
Luck, it ain't enough, you've gotta make your own breaks

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live when I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like the open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby
Don't back down

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live when I'm alive
My heart is like the open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive

This isn't how the story ends
My friends, it's just a fork along the road
Don't say your prayers, save your amens
You've come this far, but you're still far from home
Don't say goodbye, just say farewell
Write every line you'll live to tell
Hold your head high, like Harry, give 'em hell

As the night ignites the day
Make some memories along the way
Hey

Write your song, sing along, love your life
Learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of the rest of your days
Start your revolution
And I'll see you at the reunion

Some friends will go and some will stay
Okay, some last a chapter, some a page
For some, love comes disguised as lust
But you'll find love when you find trust one day
Do better than our parents did
Imperfect husband, wife, and kids
Go chart your course, then turn it upside down

Go live your life, eyes open wide
Who's to say what's wrong or right?
Right?

Write your song, sing along, love your life
Learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of the rest of your days
Start your revolution
And I'll see you at the reunion
Oh-oh


As the night ignites the day
Go make some memories along the way

Write your song, sing along, love your life
Yeah, learn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky
Take pictures each step of the way
Make this the best of the rest of your days
I say
"Go start your own revolution
And I'll see you at the reunion"

I'll see you at the reunion
Oh, I'll see you at the reunion


This isn't how the story ends
My friends, it's just a fork along the road

6 ContributorsWelcome To Wherever You Are Lyrics
Maybe we're all different, but we're still the same
We all got the blood of Eden, running through our veins
I know sometimes it's hard for you to see
You're caught between just who you are and who you wanna be
If you feel alone, and lost, and need a friend
Remember every new beginning is some beginning's end

Welcome to wherever you are
This is your life, you made it this far
Welcome, you gotta believe
That right here right now you're exactly where you're supposed to be
Welcome, to wherever you are

When everybody's in, and you're left out
And you feel you're drowning in the shadow of a doubt
Everyone's a miracle in their own way
Just listen to yourself, not what other people say
When it seems you're lost, alone, and feeling down
Remember everybody's different
Just take a look around

Welcome to wherever you are
This is your life, you made it this far
Welcome, you gotta believe
That right here right now you're exactly where you're supposed to be

Be who you want to be, be who you are
Everyone's a hero, everyone's a star
When you wanna give up, and your hear'ts about to break
Remember that you're perfect, God makes no mistakes

Welcome to wherever you are
This is your life, you made it this far
Welcome, you gotta believe
That right here right now you're exactly where you're supposed to be
(Welcome to wherever you are
This is your life, you made it this far)
And I said, "Welcome..." (to wherever you are
This is your life, you made it this far)
And I said, "Welcome..." (you gotta believe)
Welcome!

6 ContributorsLiving with the Ghost Lyrics
Marry me to the blue sky
Bury me in that long last drop of hard rain
Meet me where they stop time
That's you to me on the shovel that's diggin' this grave
'Til I can waltz on a moonbeam
'Til I can find a way to turn all tears into wine
I'll hitch my ride to a daydream
You can't unkiss the lips that love is leavin' behind

I ain't livin' with the ghost
No future livin' in the past
I've seen what hate has done to hope
Tomorrow wasn't built to last
I ain't livin' with the ghost
How can I scream? I'm scared to breathe
I wrote each word, you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain't livin' with the ghost

I set my sail over wheat fields
Rode waves of amber, let a new sun shine on my face
I dropped the sword, put down my shield
I left your scars for the stars guidin' my way
I traded hurtin' for healin'
I must admit that I was reelin', now I'm feelin' just fine
Traded nightmares for dreamin'
Go tell your shadows that I got out alive

I ain't livin' with the ghost
No future livin' in the past
I've seen what hate has done to hope
I found the tree, I cut the rope
Tomorrow wasn't built to last
I ain't livin' with the ghost
How can I scream? I'm scared to breathe
I wrote each word, you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain't livin' with the ghost
Aw


Last night I had this dream
I saw a man wash his feet in the church holy water
He worked up to his knees
From his arms to his neck, said, "I'm in over my head"
He was cryin' tryin' to get some relief
Lord, I'm just tryin' to get some relief
I had this dream
That man was me


I ain't livin' with the ghost
No future livin' in the past
I've seen what hate has done to hope
I found the tree, I cut the rope
Tomorrow wasn't built to last
I ain't livin' with the ghost
How can I scream? I'm scared to breathe
I wrote each word, you gave the toast
But we were fire and gasoline
I ain't livin' with the ghost

[Song 102: I Believe]
6 ContributorsI Believe Lyrics
All I know is what I've been sold
You can read my life like a fortune told
I've seen the dream, there's no land of Oz
But I got my brain and I got a heart
And courage built I won't let go
What we need right now is soul
I can't do this, you can't do that
They feed us lines but I won't act
And all good things will come to pass
But the truth is all you have to have
And would you lie for it?
(Do you) cry for it?
(Would you) die for it?
Would you?

I believe, I believe
With every breath that I breathe
You and me can turn a whisper to a scream
I believe, I believe

You gave it all, then you gave more
You know what you came here for
You'll pay the cost
Like it's your cross to bear
Are we the ones that put it there
Would you scheme for it
Scream for it, bleed for it
Would you

I believe, I believe
Believe we're still worth
The fight you'll see
There's no hope for this world tonight
I believe, I believe

Don't look up on your movie screens
In record stores or magazines
Close your eyes and you will see

[Song 103: Love Lies]
6 ContributorsLove Lies Lyrics
I was lost, then I found you
Never thought it would be this way
I showed you my heart, I left it unguarded
Like a thief in the night, you stole it away
Now you're gone
The pain goes on and on
I still hear you whispering to me through the shadows
Of the night

Love lies
You're just a victim of the headlines
You're runnin' on into the cold night
You're just a number through the love lies (Love lies)

All alone, you call it survival
He lost at love to a stranger's lines
Walking the streets, he's searching with vengeance
For a face that he dreams of, night after night
Time goes on, all signs of life stolen
Simple dreams were all broken
Best of times become desperation
But how many tears must you cry to survive?

Love lies
You're just a victim of the headlines
You're runnin' on into the cold night
Just a number through the love lies
(Love lies)
Love lies
You're just another victim of the headlines
You're runnin' on into the cold night
Just a number through the love lies (Love lies)

They met late one night in the city
Both men knew only one would stay
He scratched a picture of a heart on a bullet
And took his life away


Love lies
You're just another victim of the headlines
You're runnin' on into the cold night
Just a number of the love lies (Love lies)

Love lies
(You're just another victim) You're just victim of the headlines
You're runnin' on into the cold night
You're just a number through the love lies (Love lies)

(Love lies)
(Headlines)
You're runnin' on into the cold night
Just a number to the love lies

[Song 104: Till We Ain’t Strangers Anymore]
6 ContributorsTill We Ain’t Strangers Anymore Lyrics
It might be hard to be lovers
But it's harder to be friends
Baby, pull down the covers
It's time you let me in
Maybe light a couple candles
And I'll just go ahead and lock the door
If you just talk to me baby
'Til we ain't strangers anymore

Lay your head on my pillow
I sit beside you on the bed
Don't you think it's time we say
Some things we haven't said?
It ain't too late to get back to that place
Back to where we thought it was before
Why don't you look at me, yeah
'Til we ain't strangers anymore?

Sometimes it's hard to love me
Sometimes it's hard to love you, too
I know it's hard believin'
That love can pull us through
It would be so easy
To live your life with one foot out the door
Just hold me, baby
'Til we ain't strangers anymore


It's hard to find forgiveness
When we just turn out the lights
It's hard to say you're sorry
When you can't tell wrong from right
It would be so easy to spend your whole damn life
Just keepin' score

So let's get down to it, baby
There ain't no need to lie
Tell me who you think you see
When you look into my eyes
Let' put our two hearts back together
And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor
Make love with me baby
'Til we ain't strangers anymore

Mh-mh, yeah
We're not strangers anymore (Ooh, yeah)
(Ooh ooh ooh) We're not strangers anymore
We're not strangers anymore

10 Contributors99 in the Shade Lyrics
I feel I'm burning up with fever
But the fire's feeling really good tonight
And it's alright
I'm going to see Sahara Jack and Suntan Sally
Somebody tells me even Tommy's coming down tonight
If Gina says it's alright
I'm going to see those Senoritas
Lying under the sun
They're greasing it up
With the stereos on
You know I want to be their blanket
Going to tell every girl
Hey, baby... You're the one

Oh tell the boys I'm on my way
I got the radio blasting in my old man's Chevrolet
I got a party in my pocket because you know I just got paid
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade
Oh yeah!

When the sun goes down that's when the street heats up
Senorita Margarita fills your empty cup tonight
She make you feel alright
A good time here don't cost much money
Just a little sweet talking and a pretty native honey
And you're set for life
Or one hell of a night
I'm going see those sons of beaches
Out there living it up the surf
And the sand
Man that life ain't so tough
So get me in the action so I can tell
Every girl she's the one

Oh tell the boys I'm on my way
I got the radio blasting in my old man's Chevrolet
I got a party in my pocket cause you know I just got paid
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade
I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade


99, 99, 99, 99 in the shade
99, 99, 99, 99 in the shade

Oh tell the boys I'm on my way
I got the radio blasting in my old man's Chevrolet
I got a party in my pocket cause you know I just got paid
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade
I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade
I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade

[Song 106: Something To Believe In]
4 ContributorsSomething To Believe In Lyrics
I lost all faith in my God, in his religion too
I told the angels they could sing their songs to someone new
I lost all trust in my friends
I watched my heart turn to stone
I thought that I was left to walk this wicked world alone

Tonight I'll dust myself off
Tonight I'll suck my gut in
I'll face the night and I'll pretend
I got something to believe in

And I had lost touch with reason
I watched life criticize the truth
Been waiting for a miracle
I know you have too

Though I know I won't win
I'll take this one on the chin
We'll raise a toast and I'll pretend
I got something to believe in

If I don't believe in Jesus, how can I believe the Pope
If I don't believe in heroin, how can I believe in dope
If there's nothing but survival, how can I believe in sin
In a world that gives you nothing
I need something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in

[Song 107: Scars on This Guitar]
4 ContributorsScars on This Guitar Lyrics
Another Friday night, I'm somewhere
A little drunk and worn out from the show
It's a hallway to a hotel room
The truck's already rollin' down the road
I find the lights, take off my coat
I see her there, just lyin' on the bed
She's seen me through my yesterdays
God knows, tonight, I'm needin' her again

She's the place I go
When there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold
When there's no one to hold on to
She's been with me late at night when I was drownin' in the dark
She heard my every word when I was pourin' out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch, and scar on this guitar

She's given me her best when I am at my worst
When I can't find the pieces, fingers scratchin' in the dirt
And she offers no forgiveness 'cause she likes to make it hurt

She's the place I go
When there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold
When there's no one to hold on to
She's been with me late at night when I was drownin' in the dark
And she heard my every word when I was pourin' out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch, and scar on this guitar

Mornin' like a freight train
Last night still ringin' in my head
Before today becomes tomorrow
Tonight, I know I'll do it all again

She's the place I go
When there's nowhere left to run to
She's the one I hold
When there's no one to hold on to
She's been with me late at night when I was drownin' in the dark
And she heard my every word when I was pourin' out my heart
So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch, and scar on this guitar

And so I thank my lucky stars
For every crack, scratch, and scar on this guitar

7 ContributorsWild Is the Wind Lyrics
I tried to make you happy
Lord knows I tried so hard to be
What you hoped that I would be
I gave you what you wanted
God couldn't give you what you need

You wanted more from me
Than I could ever be
You wanted heart and soul
But you didn't know, baby

Wild, wild is the wind
That takes me away from you
Cold is the night without your love
To see me through
And baby, wild, wild is the wind
That blows through my heart, oh

Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
You got to understand, baby
Wild is the wind

You need someone to hold you
Somebody to be there night and day
Someone to kiss your fears away
I just went on pretending
Too weak, too proud, too tough to say

I couldn't be the one
To make your dreams come true
That's why I had to run
Though I needed you, baby

Wild, wild is the wind
That takes me away from you
Cold is the night without your love
To see me through
Baby, wild, wild is the wind
That blows through my heart tonight
And tears us apart

Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
You got to understand, baby
Wild is the wind


Maybe a better man
Would live and die for you
Baby, a better man would
Never say goodbye to you

Baby, wild, wild is the wind
That takes me away from you
Cold is the night without your love
To see me through
And baby, wild, wild is the wind
That blows through my heart tonight
That tears us apart

Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
You got to understand, baby
Wild, wild, wild, wild is the wind

Wild is the wind
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I gotta run
Just let me go
I gotta ride
Just let me go

8 ContributorsRoulette Lyrics
Bet the black comes in red
Crimes of passion rule my head
I need you, you want him
Dressed to kill, we live in sin

I know the game you play, I know it well
You just keep on playing when all the bets are down

Roulette, you're going 'round in a spin
Caught up in a game you can't win
Roulette, you're just a fantasy
It's everything that you want it to be

Play the numbers one by one
Fire the shot and the damage is done
Restless lovers pay the price
Cheating hearts don't think twice

When you make the rules no one can slow you down
You just keep 'em waiting when you're on the prowl

Roulette, you're going 'round in a spin
Caught up in a game you can't win
Roulette, you're just a fantasy
It's everything that you want it to be
Roulette, you're going 'round in a spin
Caught up in a game you can't win
Roulette, you're just a fantasy
It's everything that you want it to be

Backdoor runner got away this time
Leaves her mark at the scene of the crime
Nothing matters, no faces, no names
You're just a number, it's all the same
You just love to play the game, yeah

I know the game you play, I know it well
You just keep on playing when all the bets are down

Roulette, you're going 'round in a spin
Caught up in a game you can't win
Roulette, you're just a fantasy
It's everything that you want it to be
Roulette, you're going 'round in a spin
Caught up in a game you can't win
Roulette, you're just a fantasy
It's everything that you want it to be

I was livin' my life like a long-lost weekend
Never felt nothin', jumpin' right into deep end
I wasn't missin' nothin' that was ever worth gettin'
Never hung around enough to regret it

Came walkin' in late but just in time
You ended my excuses with a ten-cent rhyme
Your shoes and attitude were stacked way up high
I knew right then you were the story of my life

Oh, Saturday night gave me Sunday morning
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawnin'
Think I might've pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringin'
I never learned the song this heart was singin'
No regrets, I took that step, and I'm still fallin'
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah

When you're drivin' down a street that's only goin' one way
Every day starts feelin' like a month of Mondays
You should know I still got somethin' left to prove
Know what it takes to get back to you

Oh, Saturday night gave me Sunday morning
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawnin'
Think I might've pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringin'
I never learned the song this heart was singin'
No regrets, I took that step, and I'm still fallin'
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah

Remember those nights, starin' out at the lights
Makin' time with our feet in the sand
Makin' up words to our favorite songs
Laughin' loud with those drinks in our hands
And as that boy put his head on her shoulder
She pulled him tight to get a bit closer
And as the world just disappeared
You whispered in my ear

Oh, those Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning
Opened my eyes, now it's a new day dawnin'
Think I might've pushed my luck a time or two
Everything about us is what gets me through
I never thought I'd hear the church bells ringin'
I never learned the song this heart was singin'
No regrets, I took that step, and I'm still fallin'
Saturday nights gave me Sunday morning, yeah

[Song 112: Cama De Rosas]
6 ContributorsCama De Rosas LyricsSolo y tan triste estoy, como un viejo piano
Tarde ya, sin saber donde, despierto sin rumbo
Porque un litro de vodka he bebido a ayer
Y una rubia en mi cama siempre me espera tal vez
Pesadillas de cine que te hacen morir sin nacer
La mañana es tan gris, como esos besos de nadie
La canción al revés sin cabeza ni pies
Me recuerda
Cuando hablamos por fin de luchar y vivir
Del amor que tú sientes por mí
La verdad es
Yo no soy nadie sin ti
Quiero tener tu Amor entre vino y rosas
Y olvidar por fin el dolor de ayer
Cerca de ti, ser tu hombre, ser tu sombra
Tener tu amor, en tu cama de rosas
Aunque quiero correr
De casa nunca me alejo
El amor de verdad no se puede lograr con dinero
Pues tan lejos estas hacia el norte o el sur
Intento soñarte entre la multitud
Mis ojos cerrar y decirte:
Solo tu amor es la luz

Quiero tener tu Amor entre vino y rosas
Y olvidar por fin el dolor de ayer
Cerca de ti, ser tu nombre, ser tu sombra
Tener tu amor, en tu cama de rosas
Miro al mundo girar
Hacia un futuro desierto
Y mi amante me pide
Que sea su payaso otra vez
Yo, le digo, no
Si tengo tu amor no estoy solo
Ella es soledad y tú
La verdad y la fe
Quiero tener tu Amor entre vino y rosas
Y olvidar por fin el dolor de ayer
Cerca de ti, ser tu hombre, ser tu sombra
Tener tu amor, en tu cama de rosas

Baby looks the way she feels, aw
And it almost seems surreal, aw
She'll make you glad that you're alive
When she kicks into overdrive, aw

I'm in love with my first guitar

Misery likes company, I like the way that sounds
I've been trying to find the meaning, so I can write it down
Staring out the window, it's such a long way down
I'd like to jump, but I'm afraid to hit the ground

I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope, I've got nothing to say
Life is feeling kind of strange since you went away
I sing this song to you wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms

I'm tired of watching tv, it makes me want to scream
Outside the world is burning, man that's so hard to believe
Each day you know you're dying from the cradle to the grave
I get so numb sometimes, that I just feel the pain

I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope, I've got nothing to say
Life is feeling kind of strange, it's strange enough these days
I send this song to you wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms

Staring at the paper, I don't know what to write
I'll have my last cigarette-well, turn out the lights
Maybe tomorrow I'll feel a different way
But here in my delusion, I don't know what to say

I can't write a love song the way i feel today
I can't sing no song of hope - I've got nothing to say
And I can't fight the feelings that are buried in my veins
I send this song to you, whoever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding
I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope, there's no one left to save
And I can't fight the feelings that are buried in my veins
I send this song to you wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms

Ah, is it just me or does anybody see?
The new improved tomorrow isn't what it used to be
Yesterday keeps coming 'round, it's just reality
It's the same damn song with a different melody
The market keeps on crashing
Tattered jeans are back in fashion, 'stead of records, now it's MP3s
I tell you one more time with feeling
Even though this world is reeling
You're still you and I'm still me
I didn't mean to cause a scene
But I guess it's time to roll up our sleeves

The more things change the more they stay the same
The same sunrise, it's just another day
If you hang in long enough they say you're coming back
Just take a look, we're living proof and baby that's a fact
You know the more things change the more they stay the same
The more things change the more they stay the same

You're either running round in circles or you're running out of time
Everybody somewhere either 12, 3, 6 or 9
The times they are a-changing
We're here to turn the page
It's the same old story but it's told a different way

The more things change the more they stay the same
The same sunrise, it's just another day
If you hang in long enough they say you're coming back
Just take a look, we're living proof and baby that's a fact
You know the more things change the more they stay the same
The more things change the more they stay the same
The more things change the more they stay the same

Here comes a na na na na na na na
These days it's the raise the roof instead of sha la la
Here come the rockers, the dancers and the remixed drum machine
This one is for the CEOs and record companies
And if you're waiting on a happy ending
We're gonna hit the hook one more time

The more things change the more they stay the same
The more things change the more they stay the same
The more things change the more they stay the same
The more things change the more they stay the same

The more things change the more they stay the same
The same sunrise, it's just another day
If you hang in long enough they say you're coming back

Mistakes you know I've made a few
I took some shots and fell from time to time
Baby, you were there to pull me through
We've been around the block a time or two
I'm going to lay it on the line
Ask me how we've come this far
The answer's written in my eyes

Every time I look at you, baby, I see something new
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more
I don't want to sleep tonight, dreaming's just a waste of time
When I look at what my life's been coming to
I'm all about loving you

Through it all, you're always my best friend
For all the words I didn't say and all the things I didn't do

"For all of our tomorrows
And what was yesterday"
Come on

I'm singin', "Carpe diem"
I'm sayin', "Seize the day"
Come on, let's live forever
It's New Year's Day

Where does the time go?
Just watch the wind blow
Sha-la-la-la
It's New Year's Day
Green does the grass grow
Outside my window
Sha-la-la-la
It's New Year's Day

This message in a bottle
The wisdom of the wine
It's just a rainy Monday
This isn't "Auld Lang Syne"

And I'm singin', "Halleluja"
"Amen," the angels say
Let's hope tomorrow finds us
It's New Year's Day

[Song 120: Bells Of Freedom]
9 ContributorsBells Of Freedom Lyrics
I have walked all alone
On these streets, I call home
Streets of hope, streets of fear
Through the sidewalk cracks
Time disappears
I was lost, on my knees
On the eve of defeat
As I choked back the tears
There's a silent scream no one could hear
So far away from everything, you know it's true
Something inside that makes you do
What you've got to do

Ring the bells, ring them loud
Let them ring here and now
Just reach out and ring the bells of freedom
When your world's crashing down like you've lost every round
Stand your ground
And ring the bells of freedom

Up the steps of the church
Through the fields in the dirt
In the dark, I have seen
That the sun still shines for the one who believed
So far away
So full of doubt, you needed proof
Just close your eyes and hear the sound inside of you

Ring them bells, ring them loud
Let them ring here and now
Just reach out and ring the Bells of Freedom
Yeah, when your world comes crashing down
Like you've lost every round
Stand your ground
And ring the Bells of Freedom

Ring them bells, ring them loud
Let them ring here and now
Just reach out and ring the Bells of Freedom
Yeah, when your world comes crashing down
Like you've lost every round
Stand your ground
And ring the Bells of Freedom
Ring them bells, ring them loud
Let them ring here and now
Just reach out and ring the Bells of Freedom

[Song 121: Do What You Can (Duet Version)]
9 ContributorsDo What You Can (Duet Version) Lyrics
Tonight they're shuttin' down the borders
And they boarded up the schools
Small towns are rollin' up their sidewalks
One less paycheck comin' through
I know you're feelin' kinda nervous
We're all a little bit confused
Nothin's the same, this ain't a game
We gotta make it through

As we wave outside the window
Older loved ones stay inside
Moms and babies blowin' kisses
May be saving someone's life
They had to cancel graduation
It ain't fair to Skype the prom
Our kids sit home in isolation
TV news is always on

When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

The chicken farm from Arkansas
Brought workers PPE
Not before, five hundred more
Had succumbed to this disease
Honest men and honest women
Workin' for an honest wage
I got a hundred point one fever,
And we still got bills to pay

When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

They built a hospital on East Meadow
In Central Park last night
Doctors, nurses, truckers, grocery store clerks
Mannin' the front lines
I saw a Red Cross on the Hudson
They turned off the Broadway lights
Another ambulance screams by (Screams by)
There by the grace of God, go I

Although I'll keep my social distance
What this world needs is a hug
Until we find the vaccination
There's no substitute for love
So love yourself and love your family
Love your neighbor and your friend
Ain't it time we loved a stranger?
They're just a friend you ain't met yet
Oh

When you can't do what you do
You do what you can (Do what you can)
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

[Song 122: The Devil’s in the Temple]
9 ContributorsThe Devil’s in the Temple Lyrics
This was a church
A house full of prayer, it ain't that now
I could tear it down
There's thieves at the altar
A snake wears the crown, handin' you coal
Swearin' it's gold

Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn the river to blood
The savior's come and gone, we're all out of time
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine

I'd turn things around
I would if I could, crash through the gates
Break every chain
Jail for the jailers
Sing freedom's song, amazing grace
Burn down this place

Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn the river to blood
The savior's come and gone, we're all out of time
The devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine

(Ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah)

Look what they've done to this house of love
Look what they've done to this house of love
The devil's in the temple and he's making a mess
Got the Mona Lisa, got his hands up her dress
The gun is in his hand, but he ain't gonna confess
He lies

Look what they've done to this house of love
It's too late to turn river to blood
The savior's come and gone, we're all out of time
Ah, the devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
Oh, the devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine
Oh, the devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine

Ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah

[Song 123: Last Man Standing]
7 ContributorsLast Man Standing Lyrics
Come see a living, breathing spectacle
Only seen right here
It's your last chance in this lifetime
The line forms at the rear
You won't believe your eyes
Your eyes will not believe your ears
Get your money out, get ready
Step right up, yeah you, come here

You ain't seen nothing like him
He's the last one of the breed
You better hold on to your honey
Honeys, don't forget to breathe
Enter at your own risk, mister
It might change the way you think
There's no dancers, there's no diamonds
No this boy don't lip synch

Here's the last man standing
Step right up, he's the real thing
The last chance of a lifetime
To come and see, hear, feel, the real thing

See those real live calloused fingers
Wrapped around those guitar strings
Kiss the lips where hurt has lingered
It breaks the heart to hear him sing
The songs were more than music, they were pictures from the soul
So keep your pseudo-punk, hip-hop, pop-rock junk
And your digital downloads

Here's the last man standing
Step right up, he's the real thing
The last chance of a lifetime
To come and see, hear, feel, the real thing

Take your seats now, folks, it's show time
Hey, Patrick hit the lights
There's something in the air
There's magic in the night
Now here's the band, they really play
I'll count the first one in
I don't know where it's going
We all know where it's been

Here's the last man standing
Step right up, he's the real thing
The last chance of a lifetime
To come and see, hear, feel, the real thing

Here's the last man standing
Step right up, he's the real thing
The last chance of a lifetime
To come and see, hear, feel, the real thing

Real thing
Real thing

[Song 124: If That’s What It Takes]
3 ContributorsIf That’s What It Takes Lyrics
I played the part of a broken heart upon a shelf
I played that part so lonely and so well
Thought that love belonged to someone else, not me and you
Yeah, I know that you've been shattered
You been bruised
And we both know what it feels like when you lose
But I'd bet my life on a roll of the dice for you

If that's what it takes, that's what I'll do
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through
If that's what it takes, that's what I'll do
If that's what it takes...

I bet you counted all the tears up that you've cried
I bet you swore you'd never let love back inside
Because it hurt you way too bad to say good-bye
Now, there'll be times when I might put us to the test
And it's hard for broken hearts to just forget
But I'm driving blind, I'd lay it all on the line for you

If that's what it takes, that's what I'll do
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through
If that's what it takes, that's what I'll do
If that's what it takes...

So, when you feel like jumping
Just when your heart starts pumping
When you're standing out on that ledge
Staring over the edge
I'll be there to talk to you down
I'll be there before you hit the ground

If that's what it takes, that's what I'll do
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do
If we take the time to do it right, I know we'll put through
If it took all my life, I'd prove it to you
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do
If that's what it takes, I'd do anything baby
I'd do anything you want me to baby if it's me and you
It's alright, alright, alright, alright
Oh baby

5 ContributorsIf I Was Your Mother Lyrics
If I was your mother
Would you let me hold your hand?
Would you say you were my baby?
Would you always be my friend?
If I was your mother
Could I teach you what's right?
Could I tell you stories, maybe tuck you in
And kiss you sweet goodnight?

Oh, tell me what I've got to do
To make my life mean more to you
I could get so close it's true
If I was your mother

Would you always believe me?
Because I'd wake up in the middle of the night
Just to see if you need me
Tell me there's no other
With whom you're sharing your secrets
And would you tell me 'bout the boys
You been bringing home to meet me?

Oh, tell me what I've got to do
To make my life mean more to you
I could get so close it's true
If I was your
Tell me who I've got to be
To make you a part of me
No one else you'd ever need
If I was your

Mother, mother
If I was your
Mother, mother

When love is blood, you're never on trial
It don't get deeper than a mother and child
Oh baby, I got to get that close to you

Tell me what I've got to do
To make my life mean more to you
I could get so close it's true
If I was yours
Tell me who I gotta be
To make you a part of me
There's no one else you'd ever need
If I was your
Mother, mother
If I was your

I got some blood under my nails
I got some mud on my face
My voice is shot, I'm goin' grey
These muscles all ache

Don't cry for me, I'm the life of the party
I'm smilin' most of the time
I may be grittin' my teeth
Can't get back where we started
These days, I'm doin' just fine

God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess, I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine

I knew every buried body
Paid for each headstone
I may have led the prayers in public
But I cried alone

Found God through sin
But this ain't my confession
I'll wait on judgement day
It's lose or win
Got no need for protection
Stand up or out of my way

God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess, I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine

The howlin' doomsday dogs are snappin' at your feet
'Round here the sky is cracked but won't admit defeat
Down here there they got your back stood there at your side
This treasure chest of rags still keeps this dream alive

God bless this mess, this mess is mine
Won't pound my chest or criticize
I must confess, I've lived, I've died
God bless this mess, this mess is mine
God bless this mess, this mess is mine

That was my sister lost in the crush
That was our mothers, those were our children
That was our fathers, that was each one of us

A million prayers to God above
A million tears make an ocean of

One for love
One for truth
One for me
And one for you

I found spirit, they couldn't ruin it
I found courage in the smoke and dust
I found faith in the songs you silenced
Deep down, it's ringin' out in each of us, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

One for love
One for truth
One for me
One for you

Where we once were divided
Now we stand united
We stand as one
Undivided


How many hands? How many hearts?
How many dreams been torn apart?
Enough, enough
The time has come to rise back up

As one for love
One for truth
One for me
One for you
Where we once were divided
Now we stand united
We stand as one
Undivided

OK, boys, let's do it
I'm your back door Santa
I make my runs about the break of day
They call me the back door Santa
I make my runs about the break of day
I keep the little girls happy
While the boys are out to play
Well, I ain't like the old Saint Nick
He don't come but once a year, once a year
I ain't like the old Saint Nick
He don't come but once a year, ha
I come runnin' with my presents
Every time you call me, dear
I keep some change in my pocket, when the children come on home
I give 'em a few pennies so we can be alone
I keep the back door open in case anybody smells a mouse
'Cause Johnny is in trouble if there ain't a chimney in the house
Uh, oh! Gonna be some trouble boys!
Hey, Rudolph! Richard, get me out of here!
They call me the back door Santa
I make my runs about the break of day
They call me the back door Santa
I make my runs about the break of day
I keep the little girls happy, ha
While the boys are out to play

They hear me say:

1 ContributorI Will Drive You Home Lyrics
Here comes the next big thing, there's a new gun in town
There'll be a faster one, before the sun goes down
They've come to kick the tires, they'd like to take a spin
See how it takes the turns, see if it breaks or bends

But I will drive you home
I want you to know that
I will drive you home

Hell, it ain't nothing new, everything new gets old
Maybe some glitter's gone, but we're still good as gold
When some driver comes, and tries to jump the start
Thinks he can steal your love, hot wire your heart

But I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)
I want you to know that
I (I) will drive (drive) you home

Let 'em rev their engines, let 'em spin their wheels
All they've got is shine, they're just chrome and steel

But I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)


Here comes that faster fast, here comes that higher high
As we walk on past, they just step aside

I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)
I want you to know that
I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)

Let 'em rev their engines, let 'em spin their wheels
All they got is shine, they're just chrome and steel
When they raise the flag, and the smoke has cleared
When the rest are gone, I'll be standing here

I (I) will drive (drive) you home (home)
I want you to know that
I (I) will drive (drive) you home

Let 'em rev their engines, let 'em spin their wheels
All they got is shine, they're just chrome and steel
When they raise the flag, and the smoke has cleared
When the rest are gone, I'll be standing here
Let 'em rev their engines, let 'em spin their wheels
All they got is shine, they're just chrome and steel

When the rest are gone, I'll be standing here

[Song 130: Blame It on the Love of Rock & Roll]
8 ContributorsBlame It on the Love of Rock & Roll Lyrics
First time I heard the music
I thought it was my own
I could feel it in my heartbeat
I could feel it in my bones
My momma thinks I'm crazy
My dad says I'm insane
I got this boogie woogie fever
That's burning in my veins
They took me to a doctor
But it's too late for me
Then dragged me to a preacher
That they saw on their TV
Who said that for a small donation
My lost soul would be saved
I said I don't think so preacher
I'll come back another day

All that I want, is to be a Rolling Stone
They don't understand what we all know

It feels so good that it ought to be illegal
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old
Blame it on the love of rock and roll

My teachers didn't like me
They tried to put me down
Because I wore my hair too long
I played my music way too loud
Every little boy wants to learn to play guitar
So he can pick up all the chicks
And be a rock and roll star

They said it won't last, but they misunderstood
If people think it's bad then I'll be bad for good

Lord, you know it feels so good that it ought to be illegal
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old
Blame it on the love of rock and roll

Blame it on the love, blame it on the love
Dad don't understand what the little girls know
Blame it on the love of rock and roll

All that I wanted, all I ever needed
My guitar gave to me
Every song I've sung (Blame it on the love)
Every war I've won (Blame it on the love)
Everything I've done (Blame it on the love)
Blame it on the love of rock and roll

It feels so good that it ought to be illegal
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old
Blame it on the love of rock & roll

Blame it on the love, blame it on the love
Dad don't understand what the little girls know
Blame it on the love of rock and roll

6 ContributorsI Am Lyrics
How you spend your minutes are what matters
All tomorrows come from yesterdays
When you're feelin' broken, bruised, and sometimes shattered
Blow out the candles on the cake
Like everything's a big mistake

It seems you always wait for life to happen
And your last buck can't buy a lucky break
If all we've got is us, then life's worth livin'
And if you're in, you know I'm in
I'm ready and I'm willin'

I am
When you think that no one needs you
Sees you or believes you
No one's there to understand
I am
I'll be there to be that someone
When you think that no one
Is there to hold your hand
I am

We're just who we are, there's no pretendin'
It takes a while to learn to live in your own skin
Say a prayer that we might find our happy endin'
And if you're in, you know I'm in
I'm ready and I'm willin'

I am
When you think that no one needs you
Sees you or believes you
No one's there to understand
I am
I'll be there to be that someone
When you think that no one
Is there to hold your hand
I am

And I ain't got no halo hangin' over my head
I ain't gonna judge you, I'm just here to love you
I am, I am


I am
When you think that no one needs you
Sees you or believes you
No one's there to understand
I am
I'll be there to be that someone
When you think that no one
Is there to hold your hand

I am
When you think that no one needs you
Sees you or believes you
No one's there to understand
I am
I'll be there to be that someone
When you think that no one
Is there to hold your hand
I am

I felt like this dog who's been kicked in the head (Ouch)
Checked out my mail, there was this letter that read

It said, "Love for sale, love for sale"

I picked up the phone, at everyone I could
I let my fingers do the walkin' through the telephone book
You can't catch a fish if you ain't got the hook (Hook, yeah)

I say no, love for sale, love for sale

Well, send up a signal and throw me a line
Somebody explain this funny Valentine
It might not be legal but it sure ain't a crime
Bein' one step from crazy, bein' two steps behind
I called Lieutenant Columbo from my TV set
I tried the Dating Game, I haven't found her yet
I'm hopin' that she lookin' like a Penthouse Pet

(Say, hey) Love for sale, yeah, love for sale

(One more time)

Well we been living together, yeah, through years
Two hours, twenty minutes, maybe four hundred beers
She says, "You can't shop for love when you're shoppin' at Sears"

Love for sale, hey, love for sale

I guess I learned my lesson, it was easy to see
Well, my old lady, she played this joke on me
I never looked where I forgot it to be

There for sale, l-l-love for sale

And won't brush her hair, I swear

So the angels that watch over her would give a break to me

Won't you please pray for the ones like me?

But the truth is someday
Somebody is gonna take her
But the queen of hearts will always be

[Song 136: When We Were Beautiful]
5 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsWhen We Were Beautiful Lyrics
The world is cracked
The sky is torn
I'm hangin' in
You're holdin' on
I can't pretend
That nothin's changed
Living in the shadows
Of the love we made

Back when we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back when we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Let's go back and find it

Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la

Some dreams live
Some will die
But the you in me
Is still alive

Now am I blessed?
Or am I cursed?
'Cause the way we are
Ain't the way we were

Back when we were beautiful
Before the world got small
Before we knew it all
Back when we were innocent
I wonder where it went
Let's go back and find it


The world is cracked
The sky is torn
So much less
Meant so much more

Back when we were beautiful (Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la)
Before the world got small (Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la)
Before we knew it all
Back when we were innocent (Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la)
I wonder where it went (Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la)
Let’s go back and find it

Back when we were beautiful (Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la)
Back when we were beautiful (Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la)
Back when we were beautiful (Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la)
Back when we were beautiful (Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la)

Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la hey, sha la la

[Song 137: You Had Me From Hello]
2 ContributorsYou Had Me From Hello Lyrics
At the mirror you fix your hair and put your makeup on
You're insecure about what clothes to wear
I can't see nothing wrong

To me you look so beautiful when you can't make up your mind
It's half past eight, it's getting late
It's OK, take your time
Standing here my hands in my pockets
Like I have a thousand times
Thinking back it took one breath
One word to change my life

The first time I saw you it felt like coming home
If I never told you I just want you to know
You had me from hello

When we walk into a crowded room it's like we're all alone
Everybody tries to kidnap your attention
You just smile and steal the show
You come to me and take my hand
We start dancing slow
You put your lips up to my ear and whisper way down low


And when you're laying down beside me
I feel your heartbeat to remind me


From hello
From hello

[Song 138: Whole Lot of Leavin’]
12 ContributorsWhole Lot of Leavin’ Lyrics
It's pretty cold for late September
An autumn wind is creepin' in
The summer sun packed up, it's long gone
There's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on, yeah

I bet it's warm in California
I think it's time to hit the road
I just might call that band of gypsies
Go searching for our pot of gold

Seems like, lately, there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on

I close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
I still hear your voice, it takes me back to that time
Where I can find a reason to be strong
Seems like, lately, there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on

Close the window, draw the curtains
You ain't the only one here hurtin'
No one's right, no one's wrong
Lately, there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on

I close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
I still hear your voice, it takes me back to that time
Where I can find a reason to be strong
Seems like, lately, there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on
Hey


You used to live to say you love me
Now you got one foot of the door
It's then you turn around and ask me
"Do we got it anymore?"

I close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
I still hear your voice, it takes me back to that time
When I need a reason to be strong
I close my eyes, picture your hand in mine
Yeah, I hold the line, you'll never hear me sayin' goodbye
So, pretty baby, please be strong
Seems like, lately, there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on

I'll come back for you baby
Uh-huh
Uh-huh

Ride cowboy ride
Through the back door to heaven
To the other side
I wanna know the danger of a kiss at midnight
Ride, cowboy, ride (Yeah)
Yeah, I learn my lesson
Here's a story to tell
So I make my confession
In this sleazy motel
I could be the romantic
I could try my best line
But ain't got the money
And we ain't got the time
Ride, cowboy, ride
Through the back door to heaven
To the other side
I want to know the danger of a kiss at midnight
Ride, cowboy, ride, woah-oh
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
So you want to be a cowboy (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)

I wanna be a big shot (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Baby, come on (Ooh-ooh)

[Song 140: Bitter Wine]
2 ContributorsBitter Wine Lyrics
We met some time ago, when we were almost young
It never crossed my mind to ask, where did you come from?
I didn't have much money, so i stole you a rose
You were dressed like an orphan, in salvation army clothes

Once you were my inspiration, but, that river's run dry
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine

I know i wasn't funny, but you laughed at all my jokes
When i was chaking on the words to say
You shoved your finger down my throat
The first night i said i loved you, you told me to go to hell
You were giving he head, on that creeky
Old bed at the ol'duvol motel

Once you were my inspiration, but, that river's run dry
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine 

I would drink of your river, it would always get me high
What was once my salvation, now tastes like bitter wine

I never thought i'd love ya, no - i'd rather go blind
I thought i saw the future, but the fortune teller lied
I guess she lied

Just like everything, even good love has to die
Ain't no sympathy when it waves goodbye, no one even cried
We were one of a kind
I would drink of your river, it would always get me high
What was once my salvation, now tastes like bitter wine

I never thought i'd love ya, no - i'd rather go blind
I thought i saw the future, but the fortune teller lied
I guess she lied

[Song 141: Touch of Grey]
3 ContributorsTouch of Grey LyricsPeople people everywhere
There's a revolution in the air
As protest signs and people walking
Talking heads on TV talking
Pick a team and choose your side
There ain't no room for compromise
We're running out of better days
Brother all I'm trying to say is
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
You see black and I see white
No two hearts can beat the same
In a world of many colors
There's a little touch of grey
I say wrong when you say right
Different faces, different names
Brother, brother, brother
It's ok to say, hey, hey, hey
I see things with a little touch of grey
If I whisper will you listen
Will I answer if you scream
Politics and bad religion
Took a hammer to this dream
Everybody loves their children
Forgiveness and a second chance
One more thing we got in common
Ain't love why we do this dance
Ain't love why we do this dance

Hey. hey, hey
You see black and I see white
No two hearts can beat the same
In a world of many colors
There's a little touch of grey
I say wrong when you say right
Different faces, different names
Brother, brother, brother
It's ok to say hey, hey, hey
I see things with a little touch of grey
I believe there's a train still coming
I believe that there's room on board
Break the chains and raise your hands up
Be the change we're looking for
Hey, hey, hey
You see black and I see white
No two hearts can beat the same
In a world of many colors
There's a little touch of grey
I say wrong when you say right
Different faces, different names
Brother, brother, brother
It's ok to say
You see black and I see white
No two hearts can beat the same
In a world of many colors

I say wrong when you say right
Different faces, different names
Brother, brother, brother

I believe there's a train still coming
I believe that there's room on board
Break the chains and raise your hands up
Be the change we're looking for

And there I stood, just like a soldier
I was tough until I saw her
I said, "Hello," but she just turned away
"Hey, Romeo, whatcha doin'
With my girl? Who are you usin' now? "
I turn and walk away

(Turn and walk away)
I'm gonna please her
Now you can believe it
I'll be there to catch her when she falls

Ooh, here I am
(On the edge of a broken heart)
I'm a man
(On the edge of a broken heart)
Here we stand
(On the edge of a broken heart)
So run if you can 'cause you know I'm a man on the edge

I'm on the outside lookin' inside, you're with him
Who's on the wrong side now?
Do you still think of me?
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I've tried to call but no one answers
Two silhouettes, a private dancer
Lights go dim as the music starts to fade away

(Turn and walk away, the other way) I'm the one who needs you
Now you can believe it
I'll be there to catch you when you fall

Ooh, you better believe I'm a man

Only for you

I had a roof overhead
Had shoes on my feet
Yeah, sure, I was fed
But no-one was there when I was in need
Yeah

So who am I now?
Who do you want me to be?
I can forgive you, but I won't relive you
I ain't the same scared kid I used to be

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna survive
Don't want the world to pass me by
I'm gonna dream, I ain't gonna die
Thinkin' my life was just a lie
I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved

I found a picture
Our so-called family tree, yeah
I broke all the branches, lookin' for answers
Don't you know that ain't how it's supposed to be?

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna survive
Don't want the world to pass me by
I'm gonna dream, I ain't gonna die
Thinkin' my life was just a lie
I wanna give, I'm ready to try
Willin' to lay it on the line
I wanna be loved
I wanna be


I ain't gonna cry
I don't wanna scream
But I got so much left unsaid inside of me

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna survive

I wanna give, I'm ready to try
Willin' to lay it on the line
I wanna be loved
Wanna be love

[Song 144: Wildflower]
6 ContributorsWildflower Lyrics
She wakes up when I sleep
To talk to ghosts like in the movies
If you don't follow what I mean
I sure don't mean to be confusing

They say when she laughs, she wants to cry
She'll draw a crowd then try to hide
Don't know if it's her or just my mind I'm losin'

Nobody knows
A wildflower still grows
By the side of the road
And she don't need to need like the roses
Wildflower

That girl sure got a spell on me
Yeah, her voodoo's hidden right behind her pocket
Well, if she's fire, I'm gasoline
Yeah, we fight a lot but, neither wants to stop it

Well, she'll tell you she's an only child
Until you meet her brothers
Swear she's never met the man she couldn't make into a lover

Nobody knows
A wildflower still grows
By the side of the road
And she don't need to need like the roses
She's at home with the weeds
And just as free as the night breeze
She's got the cool of a shade tree
She's growin' on me, and I can't live without her

Oh, "Yesterday's a memory, tomorrow's accessory"
That's her favorite quote about regret
Well, she'll tell you 'bout her pedigree
With a sailor's mouth he woulda left at sea
It ain't over yet


No, no, nobody knows


Nobody knows
A wildflower still grows
By the side of the road
And she don't need to need like the roses, the roses

She feels at home with the weeds
And just as free as the night breeze
She's got the cool of a shade tree
She's growin' on me, and I can't live without her

But, oh, nobody knows
Nobody knows
No, no, nobody knows
Nobody knows
That's right

She wakes up when I sleep
To talk to ghosts like in the movies

Musta hit that snooze button least three times
Wishin' this morning was still last night
On any other day, just might wanna die
Traffic's backed up twenty miles to the east
Musta hit every damn red light on the street
Weatherman says it's gonna rain for a week
Hey, what can you do?

On any other day, I'd be blue eyes cryin'
I could tell the world, "At least I'm tryin'"
The clouds are breakin', the sun is shinin' new
For me and you
On any other day, I might just go crazy
The grace is knowin' that you're gonna save me
Baby, luck and love will pull us through

On any other day, I might just stay in bed
Sit down in a sea of blankets, them up over my head
Get your papers in the mornin' just to get a little edge
Then maybe just give up in time to do it all again
Hey, I like where this is goin'
Yeah, 'cause I know where it's been

On any other day, I'd be blue eyes cryin'
I could tell the world, "At least I'm tryin'"

7 ContributorsSuperman Tonight Lyrics
There's somethin' about you I wanna rescue
I don't even know you, so what does that mean?
Maybe I'm cynical, painfully logical
You're tragic and beautiful
And that's good enough for me

You're lookin' for a hero, but it's just my old tattoo
Tonight I swear I'd sell my soul to be a
Hero for you

Who's gonna save you when the stars fall from your sky?
And who's gonna pull you in when the tide gets too high?
Who's gonna hold you when you turn out the lights?
I won't lie, I wish that I
Could be your Superman tonight

If somebody sent you an angel to save you
What would you tell him to turn him away?
That your heart don't break?
That your lips don't kiss?
That life is just a lie?
That Heaven don't exist?

Who's gonna save you when the stars fall from your sky?
And who's gonna pull you in when the tide gets too high?
Who's gonna hold you when you turn out the lights?
I won't lie, I wish that I
Could be your Superman tonight


Who's gonna fix you the next time you break down?
Stranded alone by the side of the road
It's your baggage that's draggin' you down
Don't look back
Let it go
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Who's gonna save you when the stars fall from your sky?
And who's gonna pull you in when the tide gets too high?
Who's gonna hold you when you turn out the lights?
I won't lie, I wish that I was that Superman
Who's gonna save you when the stars fall from your sky?
And who's gonna pull you in when the tide gets too high?
Who's gonna hold you when you turn out the lights?
I won't lie, I wish that I
Could be your superman tonight

(Woah, woah, woah) Superman tonight
(Woah, woah, woah) Be your Superman
Woah, woah, woah, tonight
Woah, woah, woah

After the smoke clears
And it's down to you and I
When the sun appears
And there's nothing left but goodbyes
We'll just turn and walk away
How could we let it end like this?
Just turn and walk away
Should we seal it with a kiss?

It's too late
Now you're out and on the run
It's too late
Held up in love without a gun

Silent night
We hold up our candle light
Silent night
The night our love died
No words to say
And we're both too tired to fight
Just hold me close and don't let go

It was all so simple when
You were to be queen and I'd be your king
I guess those dreams got lost
'Cause, baby, you're still you and I'm still me
Now letting go
It's always the hardest part to fight
When we both know
We're just two more victims of the night

It's too late
Too late to wonder why
Much too late
To save a love that's died

Silent night
We hold up our candle light
Silent night
The night our love died
No words to say
And we're both too tired to fight
Just hold me close and don't let go
Just hold me close and don't let me go


After the smoke cleared
It was down to you and I
When the sun appeared
There was nothing left but goodbyes

Silent night
Silent night
Silent night
Silent night
Silent night

[Song 150: Seat Next To You]
4 ContributorsSeat Next To You Lyrics
Long slow drive down an old dirt road
You got your hand out the window, listenin' to the radio
That's where I wanna be
On an old park bench in the middle of December
Cold, hard rain fallin', can't find no cover
That would be alright with me

Hard days, good times
Blue skies, dark nights

Baby, I want you to take me
Wherever you're goin' to
Maybe say that you'll save me (Mhh-mhh)
A seat next to you

In the corner booth of a downtown bar, with your head on my shoulder
Smokin' on a cheap cigar
That would be alright with me
In the back row of a movie or a cross-town train
I wanna hear your voice whisperin' my name
That's where I wanna be

Hard days, good times
Blue skies, dark nights

Baby, say that you'll take me
Wherever you're goin' to
Maybe say that you'll save me
A seat next to you

Life is like a ferris wheel, spinnin' around
When you get to the top, it's hard to look down
Just hang on, we'll make it through
Save me
A seat next to you

When you get to the gates and the angels sing
Go to that place where the church bells ring
You know I'll come runnin'
Runnin' to find you

Baby, say that you'll take me
Wherever you're goin' to
And, baby, I want you so save me
A seat next to you

A seat next to you
A seat next to you (Ooh-ooh)
A seat next to you
