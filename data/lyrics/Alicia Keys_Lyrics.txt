Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before, but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young (Ya know)
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

If I ain't got you with me, baby
Oh, ooh
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing

She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy
Lonely like a highway
She's livin' in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe
But she knows she can fly away

Oh-oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burnin' it down
Oh-oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backin' down

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walkin' on fire
This girl is on fire

Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls, say

Oh-oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burnin' it down
Oh-oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not comin' down

Ooh, New York
Ooh, New York

Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seein' my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway

Even if it ain't all it seems (Come on)
I got a pocketful of dreams (Come on)

Baby, I'm from New York (Oh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of (Oh, come on)
There's nothin' you can't do (Come on)
Now you're in New York (Oh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (Oh, come on)
Big lights will inspire you (Big shine)
Hear it for New York (Uh), New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)

On the avenue, there ain't ever a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a meltin' pot, on the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge

I'ma make it by any means (Come on)
I got a pocketful of dreams (Come on)

Baby, I'm from New York (Oh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of (Oh, come on)
There's nothin' you can't do (Come on)
Now you're in New York (Oh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (Oh, come on)
Big lights will inspire you (Big shine)

One hand in the air for the big city (Uh)
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (Yeah)
No place in the world that can compare (Uh)
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

In New York (Oh, yeah)

Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together
Through the days and nights

But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one

To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So 'til the end of time, I'm telling you there ain't

No one, no one, no one

Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me
If you have somethin' to say, you should say it right now

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)

I know you said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?"
If we gon' do somethin' 'bout it, we should do it right now
(We should do it right now)

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)

Yeah, yeah

Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (Fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm sayin'

Keys has readied three versions of ‘Girl on Fire’ – the original, the Inferno and and Blue Light editions.
Spirit of Marilyn callin' me, audibly, bawlin'
She said that she would never leave, continued to torture me
Tellin' me to come with her, underneath my comforter
And she brought a gun with her, pills and some rum with her
Took me on a balcony, tellin' me to jump with her
Yeah, I'm into ghosts, but I ain't doin' stunts with her
I ain't tryna be that, haters wanna see that
But I got 'em aggy, 'cause I win the gold like Gabby

She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes, better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world, hottest of the hottest girls, say

Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down

This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

Everybody stares as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her as she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby (Mm)

Dear God, if You're here, God
Make the fire disappear when they stare, God
Take away my fear when they interfere, God
Do you fear God? 'Cause I feel God
And in my backyard, there's a deer, God
And that's a horse ranch, and to my core fans
Keep reppin' me, do it to the death of me
"X" in the box, 'cause ain't nobody checkin' me

This girl is on fire (Kyuh, fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (Fire, fire)

And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?

I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know

And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward

I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people

And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward

I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto

I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on

He was nameless, he was homeless
She asked him his name and told him what hers was

With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile
One conversation, a simple moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

Let's do it, baby
Let's do it, baby
Let's do it, do it

Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

And all the time, you were tellin' me lies (Hey)

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, own me, nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me?
Need me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky, I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love with you
Right 'til the end (Oh)

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's 'bout to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
I'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Oh, Lord
Have you ever tried...
Without my love
Have you ever tried, have you ever tried?

Hey I might not  really be your mother
That don't mean that I don't really love ya
And even though I married your father

I know how hard it gets
But I swear it's worth it, worth it

That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love

There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family, but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love, love

I know it started with a little drama
I hate you had to read it in the paper
But everything's alright with me and ya Mama
Baby everybody here you know adores ya

For love, for love
Are you this real my true love
Cause you're my baby, rejoice daily
I believe love could bring us closer than blood

I remember having four step-moms at nine
Loved Christmas time and birthday was fly
Hit my sister's just for dinner cause the cookin' was bomb
Her mother's supper made me love her like she took me to prom (uh)
And shoutout to my sisters on welfare
Flacko care, nobody else care
And shoutout to the step-sisters and step-brothers
And god-sisters, who eventually slept with us
Real love, but you do it right, alright
I'm here for you
That is alright, alright

That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love

That's just what you do (for love)
For love of the babies (for love)
We're a blended family (for love)
And it's alright (for love)
Said it's alright!
I'll be here forever

If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was I everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I've been looking for

I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh oh oh

How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I've been looking for

I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again

Every time you touch me

Touch me like this is the last time

Better pump the breaks
Well baby, slow down

You look surprised, your words don’t burn me anymore

Don’t be mad, it’s just a brand new kind of me
Can't be bad, I found a brand new kind of free

Careful with your ego, he’s the one that we should blame
Had to grab my heart back, God knew something had to change
I thought that you’d be happy
I found the one thing I need
Why you mad? It’s just the brand new kind of me

It took a long, long time to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
It took one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised

If I talk a little louder, if I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller, I been under you too long
If you notice that I'm different, don't take it personally
Don't be mad, it's just a brand new kind of me
And it ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of free

It took a long, long road to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
I've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, see you look surprised
If you were a friend, you wanna get to know me again
If your were worth a while, you'd be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry, I'm too busy finding myself
I've got this, I've found me, I've found me

I don’t need your opinion, I’m not waiting for your okay
I’ll never be perfect, but at least now I’m brave
Now my heart is open, and I can finally breathe
Don’t be mad, it’s just a brand new kind of free
That ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of me
Don't be mad, it's just a brand new time for me

And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me
But still you said that love was gone and that I had to leave

Now you, talkin' 'bout a family
Now you, saying I complete your dream, oh
Now you, saying I'm your everything
You're confusing me

'Cause what goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me?
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back?

I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waitin' for you
'Til three o'clock in the morn'

And when you came home, you'd always have some sorry excuse
Half explaining to me like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me, you never come through

Now you, wanna be a part of me (Ayy)
Now you, have so much to say to me (Hey)
Now you, wanna make time for me
What you doin' to me?

'Cause what goes around comes around

Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me?
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back?

I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you
'Til three o'clock in the morn

Night after night
Knowing something going on
Wasn't home before me
You was, you was gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy, believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what you was supposed to do
No need to approach me, boo, 'cause I'm over you

'Cause what goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me?
What goes around comes around (Yeah)
What goes up must come down (Uh)
You gotta stop tryin' to come back to me
What goes around comes around (Me)
What goes up must come down

It's called Karma, baby
And it goes around
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me?

If war is holy and sex is obscene
We've got it twisted in this lucid dream
Baptised in boundaries, schooled in sin
Divided by difference, sexuality and skin

So we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked in
Yeah we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked

Maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
Maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war

What if sex was holy and war was obscene
And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
Living for love, unafraid of the end
Forgiveness is the only real revenge

So we can heal each other and feel each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, yourself open
Yeah we can heal each other and feel each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, you open

Maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
Maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war

What if love was holy and hate obscene
We should give life to this beautiful dream
Cause peace and love ain't so far
If we nurse our wounds before they scar
Nurse our wounds before they scar

5 ContributorsIf I Ain’t Got You (Spanish Version) Lyrics


Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
I've been there before, but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Que soy solo para ti
Y nada me hace feliz
Si no estas tú, baby
Si faltas tú, baby
No quiero más variedad
Si ya no sé nadie más
El mundo es un vacío
Si me faltas tú, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Que soy solo para ti
Y nada me hace feliz
Si no estas tú, baby
Si faltas tú, baby
No quiero más variedad
Si ya no sé nadie más
El mundo es un vacío
Si me faltas tú, tú, tú
Que soy solo para ti
Y nada me hace feliz
Si no estas tú, baby
Si faltas tú, baby
No quiero más variedad
Si ya no sé nadie más
El mundo es un vacío
Si me faltas tú


Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

Oh, ooh-ooh
Nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby

There's a hole in my heart I've been hiding
I've been strong for so long that I'm blind
Is there a place I can go where the lonely river flows?
Where fear ends and faith begins

Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in

Every step makes me think that I'm closer
But somehow I just never arrived
When our hope disappears, please protect me from my tears
I need you right by my side

I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?

You know, right now
I miss someone that I love
Or fell in love with
I don't wanna cry or nothing, but
I'ma just get straight to the story
I'm a twenty-nine year-old addict

What would you know? What would you do
If you had no control over what you pursue?
You talk yourself, tell yourself, "Baby, I'm better than this"
All that I'm fightin', I don't wanna resist

And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an illusion of bliss
And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an iIlusion of bliss, hey

Live in prison of blood and flesh
An easy way out is this high, I confess
So what you lookin' at? What you wanna say?
You can't save me, baby
I don't want it no way

And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an illusion of bliss
And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an iIlusion of bliss, ah

See, my life ain't no easy road
I don't know which way to go
Won't somebody see me when I can't see myself?
Won't somebody listen before I need help?
I'm sick of being judged, sick of being sick
Tell me, where's the love?
Tired of bein' tricked
Sick of bein' high, sick of being low
Sick of all the lies, puttin' on a show
And so it persists, and so it persists
Like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an illusion of bliss

I don't wanna be a fallen angel
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm gone, gone
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm lost, lost
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm gone, gone
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm lost, lost
I don't wanna be a fallen angel

Ayo, black, it's time again! (Yeah, yeah)
(New York, New York, New York, New York)
Yeah. Premier! (Yeah, yeah)
(New York, New York, New York, New York)
(Ayo, black, it's time)

If you knew my streets
You would know all everybody talk about is who got beef
Who's snitchin', who told police
Who came home, who's still gone, who rest in peace
Now they killin' over music money, not drugs, rap replaced it
Cause thugs with no brains got no patience
New jacks I pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Saddam Hussein
Still alive lookin' at his dead children's burnt remains
I burnt the game, learnt you lames a new lesson
Your crew's soft man, ya'll need some new weapons
The Ps breed warriors in skullies and Timbies
Around micks, spics, niggas, and guineas
For my ghetto kings in deep thought we don't blink
But don't think we wastin' our time
It's a New York state of mind

New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoa, ohh
New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty

It's like a jungle out here
So much struggle out here
And my dreams steal my rest
Sleep's the cousin of death
Always feels like a race against father time
In the Streets of New York
(New York state of mind, New York state of mind)
All I see is street hoes
And bullet holes in our people
Only crime fills the brain
Feels like I'm goin' insane
The revolution has to start, don't waste no time
In the Streets of New York
(New York state of mind)
New York state of mind
(New York state of mind)
C'mon

New York, New York, New York, New York, ohh
State of mind (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York, ohh
State of crime (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York, ohh
Big dreams (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York, ohh
Big schemes

Oh, it's like the game
Just ain't the same
Baby thugs and girls with no shame
Can't get away (Get away)
Epidemic plague (Plague)
Every hood in every state
Don't have no reasons cause believin's hard to find
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)

I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin'
A lot of footsteps to follow, I been steppin'
Mind stressin' tryna find direction, crime spreadin'
Time precious, I ain't have rest since 9/11
I live fast, hustle like today is my last
I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave
Crack, D and raw, gats squeezin' off
Manhattan streets in awe from casualties of war
The eve of the Apocalypse, evil people in politics
Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis
The opposite of Liza Minnelli and Frank Sinatra
Alicia Keys, Nas and Ra the gangsta's opera
So New York City walk with me, talk gritty
It's up to us New York it's our city
Here the man come with the anthem, hands up
It's time, the thrill is back New York, let's stand up

New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoa ohh
(Uh. Yeah.)
New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty
(Crucial Keys. Ya God, Rakim Allah)
New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoa ohh

[Song 35: P.O.W]
7 ContributorsP.O.W LyricsI'm a prisoner
of words unsaid
Just lonely feelings
Locked away in my head
I trap myself further
Every time I stay, quiet
I should start to speak
But I stop and stay silent
And now I've made
My own hard bed
Inside this prison of words unsaid
P.O.W.
That's what I am
Not a prisoner of war
A prisoner of words
Mostly I say what you wanna hear
Could you take it if I came clear?
Or would you rather just see me
Stoned on a drug of complacency and compromise
M.I.A.
I guess that's what I am
Scraping this cold hard earth
For a piece of myself
For peace in myself

It'd be easier if you just put me in jail
You know, if you locked me away
I'd have someone to blame
But these bars of steel are of my making
They surround my mind
And have me shaking
My hands are cuffed behind my back
I'm a prisoner of the worst kind, in fact
A prisoner of compromise
A prisoner of compassion
A prisoner of kindness
A prisoner of expectation
A prisoner of my youth
Run too fast to be old
I've forgotten what I was told
Ain't I a sight to behold?
A prisoner of age dying to be young
To my head is my hand with a gun
And it's cold and it's hard
Cause there's nowhere to run
When you've caged yourself
By holding your tongue
I'm a prisoner
Of words unsaid
Just lonely feelings
Locked away in my head
It's like solitary confinement
Every time I stay quiet
I should start to speak
But I stop and stay silent
And now I've made
My own hard bed
Inside a prison of words unsaid

Used to dream of being a millionaire without a care
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
'Cause it's over, that just won't be fair, darlin'
I'd rather be a poor woman livin' on the street, no food to eat
'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
'Cause it's over when you said goodbye

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

Now I see myself through different eyes, it's no surprise
What being alone would make you realize
When it's over, all in love is fair
I shoulda been there, I shoulda been there, I shoulda, shoulda

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

I know I pushed you away
What can I do that will save our love?
Take these material things
They don't mean nothing, it's you that I want

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

Oh yeah, coming through with my Shaolin crew
Two cent for a case, gimme St. Ide's brew
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
Methtical's in a jam, oh how dry I am
With St. Ides in my system
Crack another I'm blessed, let's go get the next one
And get over, the object is to stay sober
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur
Call me the Wallabee Champ, stretched out, could never be Son
Ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
Laser beam, laser beam, laser beam...

Uh, uh, uh

So we all got children, products of the ghetto
Momma cooked the soup, daddy did the yelling
Uncle was a drunk, cousin was a felon
When he got pitched, he told them he wasn't tellin'
Auntie was a cook, her husband was a crook
Cause every job he had they be payin' him off the books
Ghetto university, knowledge is all it took
In a tenement I was listenin' to the hook
Change gon' come, the spirit of Sam Cooke
When the feds comin', everybody be shook
Now we doin' life like Eddie Murphy and Martin
On the chain gang, I was singing into the coffin

The roaches and the rats, heroin and the cracks
Couldn't blame me, I'm just giving the facts
I'm tryna hit the top, cause' bottom ain't where it's at
Everybody got a past but you can never go back

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)

Tellin' you like it is, how we ever gon' live?
If we ain't gettin' money, how we feedin' the kids?
It's a revolving door, where brothers be doin' bids
I know it sound wrong but the door will be what it is
Survival of the fittest, this poor girl the illest
Broke parents and black cats give me heebie-geebies
Life seems hard but nothin' ever comes easy
Whatever's in the dark, can always become the light
If you ain't in a battle, how you gon' win the fight?
I gotta speak the truth when I'm up in the booth
The streets be flyin' birds but they don't be on the roof
Poverty is a pain like you pullin' a tooth
Told the streets don't let me go like I'm Bishop in Juice

Roaches and the rats, heroin and the cracks
Couldn't blame me, I'm just giving the facts
Tryna hit the top, the bottom ain't where it's at
Everybody got a past but you can never go back

18 ContributorsWasted Energy Lyrics
Don't want your love
Don't worry who I'm seein' tonight
It's none of your business
Too bad I weren't enough
'Cause ready or not, I'm better on my own

Too many times, you turned a blind eye to the way I feel
Oh, you're the reason why I'm numb
And when I try to give you my time, it's never, ever ideal
Had to learn it the hard way, oh yeah

Wasted energy, yeah
Wasted energy
Wasted energy, yeah
Why did you, why did you fuck up the chemistry?

Brokеn promises along the way
Lost count of how many you made
My lovе, my love, my love
Tied up in your plans, still on center stage, no great escape
Wouldn't keep you, my line up, line up, line up, oh

Too many times, you turned a blind eye to the way I feel
Oh, you're the reason why I'm numb
And when I try to give you my time, it's never, ever ideal
Had to learn it the hard way, oh yeah

Wasted energy, yeah
Wasted energy
Wasted energy
Why did you, why did you fuck up the chemistry?

Kwa nini penzi umelikata miguu
Unalibidua mara chini mara juu?
Why?

Moyo unaumia, Moyo unaumia
Moyo unaumia kwa nini unaugeuza nguo karaha?
Eti karaha, oh-oh

[Song 42: Perfect Way to Die]
17 ContributorsPerfect Way to Die Lyrics
Simple walk to the corner store
Mama never thought she would be gettin' a call from the coroner
Said her son's been gunned down, been gunned down
"Can you come now?"
Tears in her eyes, "Can you calm down?
Please, ma'am, can you calm down?"

But it rained fire in the city that day, they say
A river of blood in the streets
No love in the streets
And then came silence in the city that day, they say
Just another one gone
And they tell her move on

And she's stuck there, singing
"Baby, don't you close your eyes
This could be our final time
And you know I'm horrible at saying goodbye
And I think of all you coulda done
At least you'll stay forever young
I guess you picked the perfect way to die
Oh, I guess you picked the perfect way to die"

New job, new city, new her
Bright-eyed, you would have been proud if you knew her
Flashing lights in the mirror, pull over, pull over
A couple nights in detention and it's over, a whole life's over

They came marching in the city that day, they say
Carryin' signs in the streets
Cryin' eyes in the streets
But they heard nothing from the city that day, they say
Just another one gone
And the city moved on

We're stuck here singing
"Baby, don't you close your eyes
'Cause this could be our final time
And you know I'm horrible at saying goodbye
I'll think of all you coulda done
At least you'll stay forever young
I guess you picked the perfect way to die
Oh, I guess you picked the perfect way to die"

Another dream lost
Another king and queen lost
Another broken promise they refuse to make right
Oh, another night to live in fear
Oh, another night that you're not here
Another reason to get out there and fight

But I said, "Baby, don't you close your eyes
'Cause this could be our final time
And you know I'm horrible at saying goodbye
But I'll think of all you coulda done
At least you'll stay forever young
I guess you picked the perfect way to die
Oh, I guess you picked the perfect way..."

Get so caught up everyday
Trying to keep it all together
While the time just slips away
See, I know nothing lasts forever

Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There'd be no limit to my sorrow
So all I can say

I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something
Before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour, let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something
Won't wait 'til it's too late

I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
I won't wait 'til it's too late

Just a simple conversation ('Sation)
Just a moment is all it takes (Yeah)
I wanna be there just to listen (I wanna be here)
And I don't wanna hesitate (Oh, no)

Imagine there was no tomorrow (Imagine)
Imagine that I couldn't see your face (Your face)
There'd be no limit to my sorrow (Oh no)
'Cause there is nothing that can fill this space
I don't wanna put it off for too long (Too long)
I didn't say all that I had to say (Say)
I wanna take the time to right the wrongs
Before we get to that place (Ooh)

I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways

Before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour, let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something
Won't wait 'til it's too late

Just lean on my shoulder
It's not over 'til it's over
Don't worry 'bout it
'Cause I'm gonna make sure
Our bond gets stronger, yeah
I don't wanna wait until the storm
There's something wrong
And now you're gone
And I can't find ya

I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something

It's the dreams that we weren't chasing
Come back to haunt us eventually

Tell ya darling something is calling
Drive me crazy, I just can't explain it

Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind)
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind)

No, we can't rewind, life ain't no time machine
But once you free your mind, there's beauty in everything

Check it out
It feels kinda crazy

These covers, may keep me warm at night
But they can't take your place
'Cause they're never gonna hold me tight
And these pillows, may let me rest my head
But they can't say goodnight
And tuck me in before I go to bed

Saying nah, baby girl, you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (Over and over)
But, I'm lying to myself
'Cause I know I don't want nobody else

These lips are missing you
'Cause these lips ain't kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
'Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win

These candles light up my room at night
But they can't light the room the way you did
When you walked inside, nah baby
If these walls could sing about everything they’ve witnessed
It'd be a sad, sad song
And it'd probably sound something like this

Saying nah, baby girl, you're better off
That's what I'm telling myself (Over and over)
But, I'm lying to myself
'Cause I know I don't want nobody else

These lips are missing you (Missing you)
'Cause these lips ain't kissing you (Kissing you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These arms are wanting you (Wanting you)
'Cause these arms ain't holding you (Holding you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win

Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over
(Gonna be over)
When everything in this room reminds me of you
Every time I think I'm getting closer
These tears dry me out, and once again, I lose

These lips are missing you (Missing you)
Cause these lips ain't kissing you (Kissing you)
I put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These arms are wanting you (Wanting you)
Cause these arms ain't holding you (Holding you)
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win

These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again, these tears always win

Remember when I used to tell my girls like yo this dude think he so it
Think he so fly
And every time you try to talk to me I'm like yo don't even dare try
I was on my solo groove I ain't want nothin'
I ain't need nothin', man I'm good

I used to know all the words to say

Promise you, baby

[Song 52: A Beautiful Noise]
9 ContributorsA Beautiful Noise Lyrics
I have a voice
Started out a whisper, turned into a scream
Made a beautiful noise
Shoulder to shoulder, marching in the street
When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze
But when you band together, it's a choir
Of thunder and rain
Now we have a choice
'Cause I have a voice

I'm not living to die
Don't stand in a wasteland
Look at me in the eye
Stop living a lie
And stand up next to me
You've got to put one foot in front of another
With a hand in a hand holding on to each other
Go on and rejoicе
'Cause you have a voice

It is loud, it is clеar
It's stronger than your fear
It's believing you belong
It's calling out the wrong
From the silence of my sisters
To the violence of my brother
We can, we can rage
Against the river
Feel the pain of another
I have a voice

I have a voice
And I let it speak for the ones who aren't yet running free
It's killing me
No one's saying what we need to hear
I will not let silence win
When I see all the pain our people are in
There's no other choice
'Cause I have a voice

It is loud, it is clear
It's stronger than your fear
It's believing you belong
It's for calling out the wrong
From the mouths of our mothers
To the lips of our daughters
We can, we can dream
Like our brothers speaking loud like our fathers
We can, we can heal
Can you hear us?
Can you hear us now?

I have a voice
Started out a whisper, turned into a scream
Made a beautiful noise
Shoulder to shoulder, marching in the street
When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze
When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze
But when you band together, it's a choir
Of thunder and rain
Now we have a choice
'Cause I have a voice

Now we have a choice
'Cause I have a voice

Now we have a choice

'Cause I have a voice

[Song 53: That Would Be Enough]
13 ContributorsThat Would Be Enough Lyrics
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around…
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around…

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive
That would be enough
And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don’t pretend to know
The challenges you’re facing
The world's you keep erasing and creating in your mind
But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don’t need a legacy
We don’t need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside of your heart…

Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
The story you will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter
Where you decide to stay

And I would be enough
And this could be enough
This would be enough
Said, I would be enough
And this could be enough
See, we could be enough
Oh baby
I could be enough
We could be enough
This could be enough
Oooh
Don't look no further, (No further)
Don't go nowhere
I could be enough, (I could be enough)
We could have it all

Tell me baby (baby)
Can you feel me? (Hey)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
And your family? (Me and your family?)
Listen, baby (Listen, baby)
We can have it all; (We could have it all)
Can I be enough? (Can I be enough?)
Yeah
Woo

So look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now
Look around, look around…
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now
Look around, look around…
Baby

Come on
Feel me

Shame on us, all your sons and your daughters
Thieve all your gold and we poison all your waters
Every piece of our soul is for sale, now they bought us
Think we know it all, then look where it got us

Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
We're cryin' to the wind (Uh)

Tryna play God, we been fuckin' with genetics
All that you have given and we only disrespect it
The rate that we're goin', premature Armageddon
That's what gonna happen if we let it

Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
We're cryin' to the wind, mm

Is there any savin' us?
We've become so dangerous
Is there any change in us?
Even for the sake of love
How you gonna kill your mama?
When only mama's gonna love you to the grave

Killin' ourselves, fallin' down with the sickness
Money is the king, it's a dirty bloody business
There will be no trial, but the child will always witness
If we're in love with Hell, why the hell would Heaven visit?

Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
We're cryin' to the wind

When mama gets the belt, you gon' wish we didn't do it
Had your chance for redemption, but you fuckin' blew it
Now the weather's changin' and the hurricane is movin'
Right in your direction, what direction are you choosin'?

Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
Forgive us for your pain

Is there any savin' us?
We've become so dangerous
Is there any changin' us?
Even for the sake of love
How you gonna kill your mama?
When only mama's gonna love you to the grave?

How you gonna kill your mama? Oh

He broke my heart
And now it's raining
Just to rub it in
I'm at your door
I feel so crazy 'bout it
You'll say I told you so
You saw it long ago
You knew he had to go
I finally came around
I'm back on solid ground
Can't let it get me down, no

Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

Sometimes
Some lies can take a minute
To fully realize his tears, your eyes
Thirty seconds to apologize
You give it one more chance
Just like the time before
But he already know you'd give a hundred more
Until that night in bed
You wake up in a sweat
You're racin' to the door
Can't take it anymore

I was burned, but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

Life perfect
Ain't perfect
If you don't know what the struggle's for
Falling down ain't falling down
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called the past 'cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before
You oughta see me now

Yes, I was burned, but I called it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned
So I call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned
So I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned

We're all in this boat together
And we're sailin' toward the future and it's alright
We can't make the whole thing better
We're the authors of forever and it’s alright

And we die on our own
And we’rе here to make meanin'

We could hate, we could love
We could doubt, we could trust
But we’re here to make meanin'
For as long as we're breathin'

Wherever you are, it's alright
Whoever you are, it's alright

If you find love, it feels like it's the first time

Cloudy skies and rain make a rainbow
We are builders, we are breakers
We are givers, we are takers and it's alright
We are seven billion stories
And we know the faith and glory and it's alright
Alright, oh

Don't you know eyes can be so deadly?
I try not to think, but you made me
It's just a G thing, baby (Baby)

Walk through the door, there you were
Bought you Louis, Fendi, et cetera

Woman, you should've told me you were medicine (Here we go)

Fell so hard like you said you would

When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world

In the morning from the minute that I wake up
What if I don’t want to put on all that make up?
Who says I must conceal what I’m made of?
Maybe all this Maybelline is covering my self-esteem
Whose job is it to straighten out my curves?
I’m so tired of that image, that’s my word
What if today I don’t feel like putting heels on?
Who are you to criticize when beauty’s only in the eyes…
Of the beholder, so behold her
Sing, sing, sing, why, oh, oh, oh, why, oh?

When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world

Uh, uh, I’m so secure with insecurities
Why is being unique such an impurity?
Why are the numbers on the scale like a God to me?
All of these indifferences are based on our appearances
We please to be appeased
The truest pleasure is the fact that we can breathe
Think it into existence, do it, then achieve
A fairy tale reality, beauty was with a beast
Ah, ah, ah, I’m the image of your reflection
Uh, uh, uh, you’re the image of my reflection
Sing, sing, sing, why, oh, oh, oh, why, oh?

When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can’t be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world

I should take a shot in the mornin'
Cheers to all my fears
Last night, I was caught in a moment
How did I get here?
Reminiscin' old times I had
Smile from ear to ear
Maybe it's not that bad
I shouldn't even care

But I do
I care too much, I care too much
I care too much about you
But I do
I do
I care too much
I care too much about you
More than myself sometimes

Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
It needs to be about me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
So let it be

I should push my 3 o'clock to no o'clock
'Cause I don't wanna disappear
This room got my head spinnin'
Like a carousel at a fair
I know I should give it up
But there's somethin' 'bout the chase
'Cause when our bodies touch
It erase everything

But I do
I care too much, I care too much
I care too much about you
Yeah, I do
See, I do
I care too much
I care too much about you
More than myself sometimes

Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
It needs to be about me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
So let it be

It's just me myself and I (Me, I)
Can't believe I tried (Me, I)
To help you, then you lied (Me, lied)
Like a million times (Times)
Yeah, I'm in my prime (Prime)
A few parkin' tickets, but I'm fine (Fine)
I ain't paid a dime (Dime)
Tell 'em stand in line (Me)
Baby, I got shit to do
If I was you
I would probably cry and miss me too
Dissin' who? This the new me
I'm gettin' chicken, boo

Well, at least I feel invincible

But I do (Ah, ah, ah)

I care too much about you (Ah, ah)

9 ContributorsThat’s How Strong My Love Is Lyrics
Some people, they call me crazy
For falling in love with you
They can take me and lock me away, baby
'Cause there's nothing those bars can do

I'll be the rising moon after the setting sun
Just to let you know, you'll always have someone
I'll be the clearest day when the rain is done
So you'll always know

Through the shake of an earthquake, I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm, we can risk it all
That's how strong my love is

I used to feel kinda lonely
'Cause the world, it can be so fake
And all that matters, I'm telling you, is you and me only
And the fortress from love we make

I'll be the water you need in the desert land
Just to let you know you'll always have my hand
I'll be the woman you need to be a better man
So you'll always know

Through the shake of an earthquake, I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm, we can risk it all
That's how strong my love is

Oh, can't nothing break us down
Oh, 'cause we are heaven bound
Like the mountain standing tall
Immovable, we're here to stay
Oh, can't nothing get in the way

Through the shake of an earthquake, I will never fall
(I will never fall)
That's how strong my love is (That's how strong my love is)
Like a ship through the storm, we can risk it all (We can risk it all)
That's how strong my love is (That love is)
Through the deepest waters
I won't let you drown (I won't let you drown, ohh)
That's how strong my love is
(Oh, that's how strong my love, my love, my love)
'Cause we're the moon in the sky
That will never come down (Never come down)

Caged without a key
Everyone comes to stare at me
With so much joy and revelry
They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile, I cry
They don't know what they're doing to me
Keeping me from flying
That's why I say that

I know why the caged bird sings
And only joy comes from song
She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free?

So she can fly, fly, fly
Spreading her wings and her song
Let her
Fly, fly, fly
For the whole world to see

Mmm-hmm
Hey, hey, oh, mmm
She's like a caged bird
Fly, fly
Ooh, just let her fly
Just let her fly
Just let her fly
Spread the wings

Burning cities and napalm skies

I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with the time
Left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

No fair

Oh, 'cause a woman ain't a woman if she ain't woman enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher, oh
When the world got you feelin' low
She's givin' you her best
Even when you're at your worst
Givin' comfort when she's thinkin' that you're hurt
That's what's done when you really love someone
I'm tellin' y'all, I'm tellin' y'all

Sometimes you wanna argue, sometimes you wanna fight
Sometimes it's gonna feel like it'll never be right
But something so strong keeps you holding on
It don't make sense, but it make a good song

'Cause a man just ain't a man if he ain't man enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong (Love you when you're strong)
Take you higher
When the world got you feelin' low
He's givin' you his last
'Cause he's thinkin' of you first
Givin' comfort when he's thinkin' that you're hurt
Oh, that's what's done when you really love someone
I'm tellin' y'all, I'm tellin' y'all

I'm tellin' y'all that a woman ain't a woman
If she ain't woman enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when you're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong
Take you higher (And higher)
When the world got you feelin' low
She's givin' you her best
Even when you're at your worst
Givin' comfort when she's thinkin' that you're hurt
That's what's done when you really love someone
I'm tellin' y'all, I'm tellin' y'all

Hmm, hmm, yeah

When the wind is blowin' in your face
Sometimes in life, you don't see straight
Pray to him, he will show
When your head is in a certain place
Nobody around to make you say
Stand strong and you will grow

Oooh, wait 'til you see my smile

Don't they love to see you down?
Kick you while you're on the ground
Don't let emotions show
People always speculate
Don't let it get in your way
They say things they don't know

Oooh, wait 'til you see my smile
Oooh, wait 'til they see your smile

Hey
So you're doing better now
Everybody comes around
But you don't really need 'em much
'Cause you're stronger and you're better
And you're ready for whatever, sing

And at night, it stalks me like the shadows on my wall (Mm)
Oh my goodness

Feel like the world is closing on me
Feel like my dreams will never come to me
I keep on slippin' deeper into myself
And I'm scared, so scared

If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go (Ah)
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know

Why does it feel
That my mind is constantly trying to pull me down?
I can't seem to get away
Continuous mistakes I know I've made before
How long will I feel so out of place?

If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go (You got to let it go)

Yeah

Can't stop, mmm

You just gotta let it go (You got to let it go)
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go (Don't you worry)
All your hustles ain't for nothing (Don't you worry, no, no)
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know (You got to let me know)
If you're troubled (Are you troubled?)
You just gotta let it go (Are you troubled?)
If you're worried, baby (Are you worried?)
You just gotta let it go (Are you worried?)
All your hustles ain't for nothing (But you're a hustler)
You just gotta take it slow (You're a hustler)

You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby (Don't you worry)
All you do is let me know ('Cause I will run, yes, I will run)
If you're troubled (Don't you worry)
You just gotta let it go ('Cause I will run)
And if you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go (Woo)
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow (You just gotta take it slow)
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know

Oh

You, you don't have to worry

To clear his mind
Meanwhile, I'm losing mine

We're at the crossroads, my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
Oh, I know I'm gonna miss you either way

It's such a lonely road (Where do we go?)
We go (From here?)
All I can do is (Follow)
Follow the tracks of my tears (Tears), oh

When I cry your name, am I callin' in vain? Oh
Am I waiting only to drown in pain? Oh
Don't you do it, no, said don't you leave me this way

We go (From here?)
All I can do is (Follow)
Follow the tracks (The tracks), of my tears (Tears)

Usually not the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
Who could this be, staring at me?
When I'm looking in the mirror (Mirror), tryna find a resolution
Are we too far gone to find our way home?

Where do we go (We go)
From here?

You used to the sound of a heart that's breaking
I know it don't faze you anymore
You're the king of the game that you're playing
I know you've played it a hundred times before
You fill your bedroom up with trophies
Then you get a kick out of closing the door
Got all the words to keep on hoping
I know you've said them a hundred times before

Then there's me, all fox for your gun
Then there's me, just love me for fun
Then there's me, no use in pretending
Oh there's me, 101

I might as well stand in front of a bullet
Close my eyes and kick the chair to the floor
It's like a speeding train is coming
I know you've crashed it 100 times before

Then there's me, all fox for your gun
Then there's me, just love me for fun
Then there's me, no use in pretending
Oh there's me, 101

Everybody says I gotta be crazy
That I deserve everything that I get
But I got a feeling
That makes me wanna ignore all that you've done a 100 times before

'Cause then there's me, could I be the one?
And baby, there's me, to make you undone
Uh darling there's me, no use, no use in pretending
Oh there's me, 101
Me, 101

So I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be a 101
Maybe it's time, maybe it's me
Maybe I could be, maybe pretend
I gotta be, I wanna be 101

Old school to new school
Like nothing ever been realer
On the history of the turntables
I’m the mystery of what’s inside the speaker cables
I’m Nina Simone in the park and Harlem in the dark
I’m the musical to the project fables
I’m the words scratched out on the record label
I’m the wind when the record spins
I’m the dramatic static before the song begins
I’m the erratic energy that gets in your skin
And if you don’t let me in
I’m the shot in the air when the party ends

The devil's always preying on the weaker souls
All that we can know, it was all good just a week ago
Prada carry-ons, off to Mikonos
Celebrating life on white sands, but only we can toast
Still got it cheaper though, scales like a Libra, yo
Playing on these keys like Alicia, that's her secret though
Only on the need to know, nah, you don't need to know
Had to tell the truth on this beat like Beanie Sigel though, Push

My God is plentiful
He surrounds me every day
I'm like a miracle
Feel the water beneath mе
I used to live hidden in a disguisе
Faith is the King that has opened my eyes
My God is plentiful
All my love, oh, thee I pray
Found me in Eden
Sculpted me from golden clay
Wrapped in my mother's arms
Safe in her holy embrace
Destiny is grounded in the Divine
I'll not depart, you'll forever be mine
My God is plentiful
Down my life for thee I lay

Every time I catch you watching me, I feel something down my spine
I'll play the game, it's just for fun and only for tonight
All night

I wanna know what makes you feel the way you do, you do

Should we let our desires, should we let our desires lead?

I could do more than a weapon could

They'll never forget me like Alzheimer's
In memory lane, they all drivers
That nigga, Lil Wayne, an all timer
And I'd rather you forget me than remember me wrong
Who is Nat King Cole? Call me Nat King Kong (Hrrr)

Take off your coat, take off your cliché
Show off a side that no one sees
You got the whole world right here in your pocket
Chasing those stardust melodies

So if you wanna leave alone
You gotta put on your finest
If you wanna sing your song
You gotta put the time into timeless
If you wanna take it all, let the chandeliers fall (Fall)
While you standing tall like the Taj Mahal
Be unforgettable
Like Nat King Cole
Like Nat King Cole

There are no endings, there are no yesterdays
When you hit a chord that everyone hears
Emeralds and rubies, black and white movies
They never truly fade away
'Cause greatness never disappears

So if you wanna leave alone
You gotta put on your finest
If you wanna sing your song
You gotta put the time into timeless
If you wanna take it all, let the chandeliers fall (Fall)
While you standing tall like the Taj Mahal
Be unforgettable
Like Nat King Cole (We take the moment by storm)
Like Nat King Cole (Oh yeah)

12 ContributorsElaine Brown (Interlude) LyricsIn this interlude, Elaine Brown (the pioneering civil rights activist, musician and Black Panther chairwoman) recites “Black Mother”, a poem by Bunchy Carter.Okay, can I do one more? It's really quick. So he said, "Blow black mother, black mother." He always announce the title and say, "black mother." This is rap, this is hip hop, this is all that, from the street. Poetry from the street
Black mother, I must confess that I still breathe
Though you are not yet free
What could justify my crying start
Forgive my coward's heart
But blame me not the sheepish me
While I be sleeping in a deep-deep sleep
And I be hazed and dazed and
Vipers fester in my hair
Black mother, I curse your drudging years
The rapes and heart-breaks, sweat and tears
But I swear on siege night dark and gloom
A rose I'll wear to honor you, and when I fall
The rose in hand
You'll be free and I a man
For slave of natural death who dies
Can't balance out to two dead flies
I'd rather be without the shame
A bullet lodged within my brain, black mother

Let's talk about the situation
'Bout how you came with information
It's negative in every which way
Just dissing my man and our relations
You say he's cheating, want me to leave him
I've changed my mind, I think I'll keep him
Listening to you will leave me lonely
That's not what I'm trying to be

'Cause I'll be crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe

See I, caught you trying to check my man out
How 'bout you 'plain what that's all about
Think you slick like I wouldn't know
But I got something for you, Doe
Mess around, end up in a choke hold
Girl, I think it's time for you to go
Away from my man and me

[Song 101: One Thing]
9 ContributorsOne Thing Lyrics
What, where am I?

What's life like on a train?
Nobody there knows your name
As your decision changed
Do you wish that I came?
I thought you'd pick me up from work
I waited for your truck for half hour
I know you said you were gonna
But I never thought you'd leave

This one thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody, oh

Square face and puppy eyes
Found out they never lied
Your old man lived in the sky
Left your house with a yard
But you went away a different try
Found a place that's your size
Too good to finish life here with me
I couldn't get you to say
Why you wouldn't let me come
What should be simple just ain't
And it shouldn't hurt like it does

This one thing is made for us
Won't stay with us, it ain't saving us
But I'll take one thing over everything
I'll take that thing over anybody

Baby, hold me, don't pick me up
I need a compliment
Just a touch from a friend
I need a gentle word
I need your company
I'll keep

One thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over anything
I take that thing over anybody
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody
Oh, oh, anything
Oh, oh, take one thing

Hey, hey

Hey, I never been this good, not ever, not ever
Never seen this part of me
I know that nothing last forever, however

Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow may not come
And where my heart took me I followed, you gotta follow

When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love ya
When it's all over, when it's all said and done
When it's all over, at least I got to love ya
At least I got to love ya

Hey, ask for I wanna leave
Life long legacy, me loving you, and you loving me


Oh, I'm not worried about tomorrow, tomorrow
All I know, all the time we have is borrowed, I feel no sorrow

When they lay me down, put my soul to rest
When they ask me how I spent my life
At least I got to love ya
When it's all over, when it's all said and done
When it's all over, at least I got to love ya
At least I got to love ya

Everybody say... hey hey hey hey
I got nothing else
Oh, I do nothing else
At least I got to love ya
At least I got to love ya, tell 'em, baby
If I do nothing else, gotta do nothing else
At least I got to love you
At least I got to love you

Ooh boy, what's your name, Showtime

Love, love will come find you
Just to remind you of who you are
Oh love, it will forsake you
Threaten to break you, take what you got

Everybody laughs, everybody cries
Oh, it could hurt you, baby, but give it a little try
See, that's the thing about love

Friends, sometimes will blind you
Sneak up behind you, you can't give enough
Then life, it will embrace you, ha
Totally amaze you, so you don't give up

Everybody laughs, everybody cries
Sure, it could hurt you, baby, but give it a little try
See, that's the thing about love

Oh, tell me that I am not the only one that's going through it all
Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm the only one going through it all
But it's time, oh, it's time for me to shine, hey
So, it's 'bout time, oh, it's time for me to shine
It's my time, said, it's my time, for me to shine, oh oh oh

6 ContributorsThat’s When I Knew Lyrics
Right there
In the middle of a conversation
Wasn't anything special you said
It was just there
Right then
I didn't have time even to overthink it
I loved you and all of a sudden
I was all in

It's like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
They were dancing and taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very clear

That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I was in love
That's when I knew
That's when I knew
That's when I knew

That day
I didn't know we were going where the night would end
I didn't know there was something brewing and if it was
I didn't know how much I care
That touch
When you barely held my hand, I was overcome
With feelings I don't understand
Not in a million years I didn't think that we'd be here

It's like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
Got me dancing and taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very very very very clear

That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I was in love
That's when I knew
That's when I knew
That's when I knew
Don't you know it?
Hey
That's when I knew, baby
That's when I knew
That's when I knew
Baby

You know (that) you know
You know what you feel
And there's no denying
That love is for real
There is nothing to do
Just let it in
Gotta surrender

That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I fell in love
(That's when I knew)
(That's when I knew)
(That's when I knew)
That’s when I knew with that minute
That’s when I knew it was that beautiful
Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it
That’s when I knew it, baby
Yeah, that’s when I knew
That’s when I knew we fell in love

5 ContributorsPlace To Call My Own (AK Version) Lyrics
When it rains, it pours
Life can be so lonely
But the fate of the storm
Makes the weight less heavy
This life can seem so unfair
But who cares?
If I can rise up
Then I will get there

And I'm looking for a place to call my own
I'm looking for a house to make a home
I'm looking for a seat upon a throne
I'm looking for a place to call my own

Hey, hey
The hottest place to go
It's where you've never gone before
It takes a brave, brave soul
But it makes you much stronger
Now I feel so alive
And there's no more cries
I chose to rise up
And there's no denying

That I finally found a place to call my own
I finally found a house to make a home
I finally took a seat upon my throne
And now, I have a place to clal my own

So many people
They try to make you
Make you believe that
You're nothing without them, no
Don't you believe it
Not for a minute
You gotta show 'em
This is my way

No, I have a place to call my own
Now, I have a house to make a home
Now, I have a seat upon a throne
Now, I have a place to call my own

Hey, hey
I didn't worry about a thing
Hey, hey
They'll never worry about a thing

How do you love someone
That hurts you oh so bad?
With intentions good
Was all he ever had

But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long, and I've
Given him all that I could?
Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Givin' up what seems your lifetime
What went wrong with somethin' once so good?

How do you find the words to say (To say, to say)
To say goodbye (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (To say, to say)
To say goodbye? (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)

I know now I was naïve
Never knew where this would lead (Yeah, yeah)
And I'm not tryna take away, oh no
From the good man that he is

But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long, and I've
Given him all that I could?
Was it somethin' wrong that we did
Or 'cause others infiltrated? (Infiltrated)
What went wrong with somethin' once so good?

How do you find the words to say (To say, to say)
To say goodbye (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (No, my heart don't have the heart)
To say goodbye? (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)

Is this the end? (End)
Are you sure? (Are you sure?)
How should you know when you've never been here before? (Never been here before)
It's so hard to just let go (Hard, just let go)
When this is the one and only love I've ever known (Only)

So, how do you find the words to say (Man, it's been so long)
To say goodbye (To say goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (Mm-mm-mm, yeah)
To say goodbye? (To say, to say goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)

8 ContributorsLove is My Disease Lyrics
When you're gone, it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?
(Yeah)

Baby, baby, baby
Am I addicted
When I need you here all the time, oh?
And I'm not sure if this is healthy
Is it a sickness?
'Cause I feel like I'm losin' my mind
And I know that there's no medicine
Nothing I can take, no remedy
Baby, please stay

Oh, when you're gone, it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease (My disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you? (Yeah)

Oh, oh, oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
I get a fever
Just the thought of you leaving my side
Oh, and I'm not the same 'til you're back holding me
That's all I need
Oh, yeah

When you're gone, it feels like (When you're gone, baby)
My whole world's gone with you (Gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease (My disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

Oh, here's what I'm going through when you're gone
Some serious symptoms of withdrawal
Tossin' and turnin' in my bed
Wakin' up drenched in a cold sweat
Lyin' here longing for you
What am I supposed to do
When I'm stuck and I can't get enough of your love?
Oh, whoa, baby

When you're gone, it feels like (When you're gone, baby)
My whole world's gone with you (Gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease (My disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

Just to make up and go back again?
It's never too late, it isn't too long
Can't get it right when no one thinks they're wrong
Gotta get outta bed
And take a look at what's goin' on

Old memories, they don't go away
They show up before you leave
And disappear when you wish they'd stay
No heart is immune, no secret is kept
Yeah, they only get stronger with age
Old memories, they don't go away

Old love songs, they don't ever end
Just when you think that you've moved on
They remind you, you ain't over it
Sneak in the dark, creep in your bed
Playing over the loss in your head
Old love songs, thеy don't ever end

It's a problеm I'm telling ya
Makes you temperamental
It takes all of the best of ya
You ain't gon' never let go

Old photographs never fade away
They're just frozen there in time
Locked in pretty picture frames
Bridges we burn (Yeah), the once happiness (Yeah)
It's a black and white that you can't change
Old photographs never fade away

It's a problem I'm telling ya
Makes you temperamental
It takes all of the best of ya
You ain't gone never let go

Look at me
Lost in yesterday
Thought that I was over you
But you haunt me in every way
My heart is with you (Yeah)
The secret is out (Yeah)
And it only gets stronger with age
Old memories of you and me
They don't go away

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Life is cheap, bittersweet
But it tastes good to me
Take my turn, crash and burn
That's how it's s'posed to be

So don't rain on my parade
Life's too short to waste one day
I'm gonna risk it all, the freedom to fall
Yes, it sure looks good to me

Time passed by and leaves you behind
Take it naturally
Heaven knows there's so much more
More than what we see

So don't rain on my parade
Life's too short to waste one day
I'm gonna risk it all, the freedom to fall
Yes, it sure looks good to me
Hey, sure looks good to me

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Deep in my mind, I'm secure with getting by
I wanna see the light before I die
Before I lie in an empty space
The darkness comes and I've been tellin' my soul
And me and myself, we turn around, we're gettin' old
But the lightning crashing, foolish emotions
Are the bruises and the beauty of this moment that we're feelin'
And I feel like I'm seeing the world inside of me
But I can tell you that I know it's getting easier to breathe
There's a cold in the morning, endless equation
Of who we've become, it's a complex situation
So live love life, give love, live love life, give love
Live love life, give love, 'cause who are we anyway?

So don't rain on my parade
Life's too short to waste one day
I'm gonna risk it all, the freedom to fall
Yes, it sure looks good to me
Hey, it sure looks good to me
I'm tellin' you, it sure looks good to me
Yeah, sure looks good to me

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way you prove you love them
Listen baby, hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
(I don’t know, I don’t know)
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

If I ain't got you with me baby
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby, yeah
Thank you

Over and over, yeah

He's a man so full of style and grace
Any woman'd be impressed
Takes a smile and paints it on your face
Makes you feel like you've been blessed
Promises things so special
Seems to come right from a song
Soon as you begin to feel secure, yeah
You turn around and he is gone, oh

Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
He's a Samsonite man

Maybe he is just a rollin' stone
Wandering from here to there
Searchin' for a place to call his own
You wonder if he even cares
So many years of heartache and pain
Is all you seem to know him for
Is it you or is it he to blame?
Whenever he walks out your door, oh

Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
He's a Samsonite man

Where ya always runnin' to?
Away from me

If the wind blows you in my direction
You come through to rendezvous
Forget about your good intentions
To leave me lonely and confused
Mr. Samsonite man, pack a bag, that is my suggestion
From here on out, you will be leavin'
At my discretion (Yeah)
Said, I know the game, baby
And it'll never be the same, no, no, no, no, no, no
'Cause now, I got him

Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go

Why don't you just go?
You can't hurt me no more, baby
You can't touch me
You can't hurt me no more, baby
Gotta go, gotta go
Pack your bags
Pack it up, got to go
Hit the road, Jack

3 ContributorsPray for Forgiveness Lyrics
Beautiful garden, where have you gone?
My self-delusions are leaving me in the storm
Taking for granted all the goodness that I've found
Somewhere I lost all, the control came crashing down

And I pray for forgiveness
Look for the answers
'Cause it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother, call to the captain
Can't you see this state that I'm in?
And no one would know this, nobody noticed
'Cause it's me where it begins

Beautiful morning, please don't wake me from my sleep
'Cause I need some comfort to regain my sanity
And I don't wanna feel this crazy
I don't wanna feel discarded
Shattered into million pieces
I'm so brokenhearted
Nowhere left to run
Nowhere left to go
So I hope

I pray for forgiveness
Look for the answers
'Cause it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother, call to the captain
Can't you see this state that I'm in?
And no one would know this, nobody noticed
That it's me where it begins
And I pray for forgiveness within

I swear that every day I feel like my mind is haunting me
I think of every little stupid mistake that has been made
This time, I don't have the strength to gather myself
And I'm falling to pieces

And I pray for forgiveness
Look for the answers
'Cause it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother, call to the captain
Can't you see this state that I'm in?
I pray for forgiveness (Pray for forgiveness)
Looking for justice (Looking for justice)
Searching for answers (Searching for answers)
Call to my mother
Pray for forgiveness (Pray for forgiveness)
Breaking the silence
And nobody knows this, nobody noticed
That it's me where it begins

[Song 132: Let It Be]
3 ContributorsLet It Be Lyrics
John and I are both deeply inspired by the music of the 1960s
We stand in the shadow of timeless and monumental artists like the Beatles and Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin
The forever changed what popular music could say and what it could mean

The masterpiece we're about to play tonight was written by Paul just as the Beatles were breaking up. Paul dreamt of his mother Mary, who he lost when he was 15, comforting him and telling him everything was gonna be ok.  It's a song that comforted generations with its beauty and its message

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
When the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be now, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
When the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Oh, now let it be

[Song 133: Is It Insane (Originals)]
9 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsIs It Insane (Originals) Lyrics
Turn my mic up

Is it insane?
My life's in your love's hands
Is it insane?
You got a hold on me

When you're near all of me trembles
Slightest touch and I'm no good
When you walk out my door
I want you more

Is it insane?
I was the one who called them fools
For being blinded by love
Now it's me who can't break free

Even though you're with her
I still feel you in me
And I know when you kiss her
You're wishing that it was me


Is it insane?
Thought you'd be my king
I'd be your queen
It would be complete with a wedding ring
Was that just me imagining? Oh

Now I cry like I'm your widow
Without you, I can't sustain
This is my soul's last refrain
And you'rе the one that I blame

Shе can have you now
I just wanna fade away
Sacrifice my life
To relieve this pain
So much pain
Lord, take away the pain
Is it insane?

Yeah, 1, 2, 3, woo
Come on, ladies, show 'em whatcha got
You know you got it good, yeah
Sing to 'em, girls
It looks good like that
Here we go, here we go, what's up
1, 2, 3, uh...
Toe to toe
Dancing very close
Barely breathing
Almost comatose
(Come on, come on, don't stop)
Wall to wall
People hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture
(I like that, haha, come on)
Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spineless movements
And a wild attack
(1, 2, 3, hit it!)

Face to face
Sadly solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture
(Yeah, come on, ladies, let's go!)
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly
To all my hot girls and my hot guys
You know I'm fresh, you know I'm good
Keep the latest fashion like we always could
There were four friends, in New York they met
And they always stick together in the City of Sex
Me and my girls gonna catch a cab
Up Fifth Ave. with some shopping bags
Wherever I go, two friends behind me
Three's company but four is a party
Turning heads in a cute little cafe
Girls night, conversation getting nasty
Empire State, Emirate State
Me and my homegirls, 'cause they my soul mates
Grown and sexy while you married with kids
'Cause I'm so Carrie and my man's so Big
Hahaha, you like that? 1, 2, 3, go!
Toe to toe
Dancing very close
Barely breathing
Almost comatose

Wall to wall
People hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

You know I can't let you slide through my hands

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away, oh oh

Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Baby, wild horses couldn't drag me away

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie, oh
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time

It's gonna take so long for me to get somewhere
Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted
But I can't explain 'cause I'm so guarded
But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there
Can you send an angel?
Can you send an angel?
'Cause I don't wanna feel
Like a dove with no wings
And I don't wanna know
What a heart of stone would bring
But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there
Can you send an angel?

Please, send me an angel

[Song 137: Streets of New York (City Life) (Unplugged)]
2 ContributorsStreets of New York (City Life) (Unplugged) Lyrics
Here I am, here we are
As it will go on forever
Noise, always noise
Candles burn, lights are low
I haven't a place to go
Life in its constant state of moving nowhere
The music is nice, floats through the air
Sounds of waves crashing everywhere
Percussive submissions, mind conditions
Writing with the left hand
Unknowing and taking the chance
Why not fly? Why not try?
This constant game I play to stay high
But all is just a state of mind
All is reality of your choice
Constant evolution, constant adaptation
Constant state of moving nowhere
Footsteps, silence is loud
Kindness is brave, wisdom is long
Loving is necessary, I need it, we need it
Searching, looking for the satisfaction
It is nowhere, it is everywhere
Preaching, pleading, praying for God to come
What are we waiting for?
Why are we so afraid of taking charge?
But it's always changing, always
In the constant state of going nowhere
We all have demons to battle, roads to walk
Crosses to bear, mistakes and sins
Candles and their steady glow
Water and its constant crash
Endless horizon, rocks of times long gone
Still strong, still here, and so are we
Here we are, forever
The constant state of going nowhere
The constant state of going nowhere
Constant state of going nowhere
Con-con-constant state of moving nowhere
Constant state of moving nowhere

It's like a jungle
It's like a jungle

It's like a jungle out here, so much struggle out here
And my dreams steal my rest, sleep's the cousin of death
Always feels like a race against father time
In the streets of New York
All I see is street hoes, and bullet holes in my people
Only crime fills the brain, feels like I'm going insane
The revolution has to start, don't waste no time
In the streets of New York
Uh, uh, uh, yeah

9 ContributorsPaper Flowers (Originals) Lyrics
Somebody never told me there's a last time for everything
Even a landslide is an opening
Turning metal into gold, silver lining
Somebody never told me

Paper flowers don't die
But neither do they live, like you and I
Lightning never striking twice is a lie
Like good things coming when you wait
To tell the truth, I gotta say
I don't believe in yesterday
I don't wanna live forever, anyway
For a momеnt that was never herе to stay
Forget about tomorrow
For just today

Somebody never told me there's a first time for everything
It's a free fall, discovering
On the day you get that call and the waiting is over
It all changes in the blink of an eye

Paper flowers don't die
But neither do they live, like you and I
Lightning never striking twice is a lie
Like good things coming when you wait
To tell the truth, I gotta say
I don't believe in yesterday
I don't wanna live forever, anyway
For a moment that was never here to stay
Forget about tomorrow (Forget about tomorrow)
Just for today
Forget about tomorrow
Just for today (Just for today)
Ah

Who really cares?
Who really cares
When I talk
What I feel
What I say?
Nobody, not really
Who wants to take
The time to understand?
I would like someone to heal me with some empathy
But I can't find…
Nobody, not really
Maybe I'm invisible to the world
Does anyone in the world even think of me
As more than just a hopeless cause?
Maybe the world is not my block
My stoop
My life
My dreams
My anything, anything
Who wants to help?
Momma, but she's so tired
Papa, but you're not here
I'm alone in a big empty space with
Nobody, not really

I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (dímelo)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stashbox, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas

Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty-Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high five

So they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is

Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve

Into the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
"Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life

Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pull you in
Then it takes ya, takes ya over, over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
First, you're floating high
Then it takes ya, takes ya
Under, under

Well, it's cold
Cold under water
In the nighttime
But I dove
Dove to the bottom
To see what I'd find

That's when I saw a light
A glowing paradise
Thought I'd stay a while
It's been callin' me underwater, child
Everything that I ever dreamed
Taking my breath away (Ay)
Currents got hold of me
Sweeping me away
Wish that I could stay
Takes me to the top
It's a cycle that never stops

Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pull you in
Then it takes ya, takes ya over, over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
First you're floating high
Then takes ya, takes ya
Under, under

(Takes ya, takes ya over)
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
Over!
(Takes ya, takes ya, under)

See, I've been told
Told you only find it once in a lifetime
So you better hold
Hold on stronger then ever
Like it's the last time

So when you see the light
Like a ship in the night
You have found the place
You been looking for
Like a distant shore
Don't you ever look back again
Here's something you should know (Know)
The sea is still in control (That's right)
Cherish everyday
Cause you never know
It can take away
The very thing that you love the most (Love the most)

Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pull you in
Then it takes ya, takes ya (Takes ya, takes ya over)
Over, over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees (leaves you on your knees)
First you're floating high
Then takes ya, takes ya (Takes ya, takes ya under)
Under, under

(Takes ya, takes ya over)
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
Over!
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
Listen, love is like the sea, yeah
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
Can you feel the pull?
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
It's calling you
(Takes ya, takes ya under)

Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pulls you in (If you ever felt this way before)
Then it takes ya, takes ya
Over (Then you know)
Over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
First you're floating high (Oh, get down on your knees)
Then it takes ya, takes ya
Under, under (Take me away)

7 ContributorsStolen Moments Lyrics
Rememberin' the days when our love began
Thinkin' of a million ways
To escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and I
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights

Dream about you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say

Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oooo)

Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)
I was just a girl and you a young man
How could age define
Something so divine (so divine)
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind

Dreamin' 'bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say

Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oooo)


Dreamin' 'bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' and waitin' for the day
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine

Each and everyday
I don't walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide
Sneak around and lie
Just to spend time alone
This lovin' is a crime
I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind

Let me take you to another place
Where nothin' ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oooo)


Let's get away
Let's get away
Ohh
We can get away
We can get away
Ohh
Let's get away
Let's get away
Ohh
We can get away
We can get away
Ohhh

Da, dum
Da, dum

Hello morning
Now I see you
'Cause I am awake
What was once so sweet and secure
Has turned out to be fake

Girl, you can't be scared
Gotta stand up strong
Let 'em see what shines in you
Push aside the part
Laying in your heart
Like an ocean is deep, dark, and blue

You are a golden child
You are a golden child

Golden sunshine's
Peeking through the grayness of your mind
Soon it will be in full view
And rain won't stain your eyes

Girl, you'll be smart
Look in your heart and see what shines in you
Push aside the heartless
That feeds you darkness
Like an ocean so cold and bluе, ooh

You are a golden child
You are a goldеn child

You don't have to be afraid 'cause time is on your side
And they don't know the power you possess
Or the beauty that's inside

You are a golden child
You are a golden child
You are a golden child
You are a golden child
You are a golden child (Don't you let nobody drag you down)
You are a golden child (Don't you let nobody say you're not)
You are a golden child (Even when no one's there, and no one believes)
You are a golden child (Still, still I am, oh, a golden child)

[Song 150: Dead End Road (Originals)]
9 ContributorsDead End Road (Originals) Lyrics
My heart is heavy like a stone
Hot as Hell up in the cold
Loneliness is sleeping in my room
Love is empty on the plate
Nothing left to give or take
Waiting for the dawn to break in two

But the sun don't dry
Nothing
And the waterfalls
Keep coming
And tears keep breaking through

At least we'll try (Try)
Try to make it
When you're living right, but it's going wrong
We try (Try)
Try to make it
When you feel like you're living on Dead End Road
We still try
Try, try, try

If I should die before I wake
Would tears wash away mistakes?
My troubles should be madе to fade to nothing
'Cause I don't want to be thе one
To turn the lights off on love
I just wanna be above something

But the sun don't dry
Nothing
And the waterfalls
Keep coming
And tears keep breaking through

But at least we'll try (Try)
Try to make it
When you're living right, but it's going wrong
We'll try (Try), yeah
Try to make it
When you feel like you're living on Dead End Road
We still try
Try, try, try

If we just try
If we just try
Something, yeah
At least we'll love
At least we'll love
Something
When you feel like you're living on Dead End Road
You gotta try, baby
Try, try (Try, baby)
Try, try, try, try, try, try
