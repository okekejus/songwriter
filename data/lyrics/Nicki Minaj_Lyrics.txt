Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup
For a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried 'bout if my butt fake
Wo-worried 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-These girls are my sons
Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-Fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-Ring finger where the rock is
The-These hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-Ma-Mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me
Lance Stephenson

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothin' but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothin' but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side (Yeah), only

I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "Goddamn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sittin' down on that big butt
But I was still starin' at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston, Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doin' makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in somethin', I stand for it
And Nicki, if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky (Pinkprint, ayy)
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothin' but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothin' but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "B" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean "pop-pop-pop," then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx actin' like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothin' but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Young Mula, baby!
Nothin' but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
"I used to pray for times like this" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said "Go to hell"
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, "Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?"
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake
I been a five-star bitch, man, word to Gotti
I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', "Gang! Gang!"
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang
Tekashi want a ménage, I said "tre-way"
Curved him and went the Kim and Kanye way
Em, cop the Barbie Dreamhouse, then you can play the part
I-I ain't tryna bust it open in a trailer park

I said, "Just lick on the clitoris, nigga, don't fuckin' bite it"

He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song

Oh, I get it, huh, they paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well it's the last time you gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me

I went and copped the chopsticks, put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit, box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip
How many of them coulda did it with finesse?
Now everybody like, "She really is the best"
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on

Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, I'm King Kong
This is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong
In my kingdom wit' my Timbs on
How many championships? What? Six rings on

They need rappers like me
They need rappers like me
So they can get on their fucking keyboards
And make me the bad guy, Chun-Li

Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on

He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song

I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop "Another One", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
"Back to Back"? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery
Rah took you to her doc, but you don't look like Rah
Left the operating table, still look like "nah"

'Cause I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

Yeah, yeah, never been no fraud
Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, "What up, Killa?"
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, "Man, why him?"
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know

I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

Uh, I am not a fraud, YM, I'm the god
They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur
Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, "Alright, alright, alright"
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana
Just told my lil' mama, "Babe, I think I love you, kinda"
Feelin' like Tune-y Montana, Weezy, he get honored
Drake a headliner, and Nicki, she get finer, word

He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Alright)
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Uh)

She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me, "Make me a wife"
I tell her, "Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?"
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, "What about them niggas?" She say, "What about them niggas?"
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself
Lil Tune

They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?

I know you want it, boy
I see you tryin'
Just keep on pushin'
I'ma let you slide in
Just close your eyes and
This horizon
It's ready, come get you some
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You sent flowers, but I wish I didn't receive 'em
All your lies, I wish I didn't believe 'em

That boy is a real pussy pleaser
All that fetty, but he never met Masika
Tuck the chrome 22 in his sneaker
El Chapo, but he crazy like La Quica
Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate
But I shoulda listened to what mama told me
Furry moon boots, shades DITA
Too high to give a shit about PETA

Sativa so strong, I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinking?
New day, new money to be made
New things for them to imitate
I-I'm a fuckin' Black Barbie
Pretty face, perfect body
Pink seats in the 'Rari
Always fuck him like I'm sorry
Who the fuck is gon' protect her?
If I really gotta check her
Peter Piper picked a pepper
And my cake is triple decker

(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no) No-flex zone, no-flex zone
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no) No-flex zone

I see these silly nigga's flexin', it's a no zone
You gon' be floatin' in dem rivers like you know Joan
Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home
Still pull up with my wrist lookin' like a snowcone
She said she got a hit record, I said, "Ooh, shit"
Picked up my phone 'cause I had to call bullshit
These bitches havin' nightmares of my new shit
These bitches pussy and they don't ever do shit
Get it? Douche
Half a milli on the Maybach Pullman, bought it
Now I'm prayin' all my foreigns don't get deported
Niggas love me so much they be sendin' me gifts
And these clown niggas actin', I'ma send 'em some skits
Bitches can't rap for shit, I'ma send 'em some tips
All these bitches is my sons, should be suckin' my tits

(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no)
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no)
Now usually I don't do this, I'm Popeye, she's Brutus
Usually I'm a Christian, but this peace is Buddhist
All of my niggas draw, but none of them cartoonists
Usually I'm the baddest, usually I'm the cutest
Usually I'm the flyest, usually you're the stewardess
And we ain't playin' ball, but usually it's some shooters
Are these bitches drunk? These bitches ain't lucid
Go against the queen, your career will be elusive
Where your plaques at? Where them stocks? Word to NASDAQ
Bitches ass-back, they was never in my tax brack
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)

That boy is a real pussy pleaser
All that fetty, but he never met Masika
Tuck the chrome 22 in his sneaker
El Chapo, but he crazy like La Quica
Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate
But I shoulda listened to what mama told me
Furry moon boots, shades DITA
Too high to give a shit about PETA

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull living like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, "Why, God?"
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear the mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad
You and this boy Slim Shady
What's going on? They'll lock you away
They'll put you in a jail cell, I promise
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed, run along, let's go, come on
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys

Even though you out here lookin' so ungrateful

I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learn that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet

Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible

Man, keep it all real, I'm a prophetess (Okay)
So at least you took an L off your bucket list (Bucket list)
It's time to make hits and it's time to diss
How you still dissin', still can't find some hits? (Okay)

Still on that show gettin' no chips, time to dip

Wanna be in demand, get booked like me
Wanna run up in the lab and cook like me
But ain't nan you hoes pussy good like me
Pussy so good his ex wanna still fight me
Face so pretty bitches wish they could slice me
She just mad 'cause he never bought her ice like me
I cut all my niggas off, but they would still wife me (Still wife me)

Rap bitches tell they team, "Make 'em like Barbie"
Had to come off IG so they can't stalk me
All they do is copy looks, steal music too
Want to see what bitches do when they lose the blue-print
I mean the pinkprint, ho, let it sink in
I spoke to Jay the other day, he's still the kingpin
He's still the only nigga that I woulda signed to
If I ain't sign to Wayne's perfectly designed crew
'Cause we the big three, don't need a big speech
We made the biggest impact, check the spreadsheet

Niggas gettin' more cheese, kissy face

Bitch get slick, I'ma cut the bitch
I'm a bad bitch, suck some dick (Okay)
If that bitch get slick, I'll cut the bitch

Had to fuck up the bitch, man, fuck the bitch
Won't shoot her but I will gun-butt the bitch
When we say "Fuck the bitch," dick up the bitch
She was stuck-up so my niggas stuck up the bitch
Still draggin' her so don't pick up the bitch
Get the combination to the safe, drug the bitch

When it come to stealin' flows, these birds is fluent
But they stutter when get asked 'bout the queen's influence

I don't wanna check bitches, tell 'em wear their Nikes
Barbie tingz, that's Barbie tingz
Big Barbie tingz, that's Barbie tingz
Big Barbie tingz, that's Barbie tingz
Uh, Barbie dreamhouse, Barbie rings
That's Barbie beach house, Barbie Benz

All tea, all shade, bitch, all offense
If you ever try to confiscate Barbie's Ken
I'ma put you in the box where my dollies been
Chop it up and the next stop garbage bin
'Cause you hoes too old to be gossipin'
I'm just tryna find out when the new Porsche come in

Your flow is such a bore
Drinkin' a bottle of Henny through a straw
Bitch, you better stop that dialogue (28 shit)
'Fore I hit Carl and buy your catalog
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Sigh
How you fuck your mother man when she die?
How you go on Gayle King and can't cry?
Chile, bye
Big Foot, but you still a small fry
Swearin' on your dead mother when you lie (Ayo)

This lil' beggin' whore talkin' 'bout Megan's Law
For a free beat, you could hit Megan raw (Ooh)
If you a ghostwriter, party in Megan jaw (Ooh)
Shots thrown, but I still ain't let Megan score (Tell 'em)
Bad bitch, she like six foot (Ooh), I call her Big Foot (Brr)
The bitch fell off, I said, "Get up on your good foot"
Uh, still ain't topped "Red Ruby" (No, no, mhm)
Tryna steal the sauce, I said, "Get up out my cookbook" (Brr)
But really, I'm a sweetie pie
P-R-T-T-Y, but I'm P-E-T-T-Y (Brr)
Um, why did you lie about your lipo?
Fuckin' your best friend man is crazy, you the type, though
You was lyin' to the queen, then you went lyin' to the King, Gayle
The thirty-year-old tea so stale
Kylie kicked you out and made you stumble to the car
Barbz, I need a good alcohol bar
Roman, wait, that was the bar
Like a body builder, I keep raisin' the bar
Fuck you get shot with no scar? (Brr)
This little piggy toxic, somebody adopt it
Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Shit'll get dark like chocolate
I'm 'bout to get up in your ass, bitch, clench (Woo)
Mm, yeah, sorta like French
They got you all them Grammys, but your flow's still a no
What a fiasco, Lupe
Future made you pay (Haha)
She wanna party with DaBaby while rubbin' on Tory toupée
I guess she needed money bags for them Trey Songz
She G-Eazy, Carl made her crawl for it
Yo, why the fuck they poke the monster?
Fuckin' with Nicki this year, ho, I'm comin' like a pornstar
She just mad that no nigga ever loved her
No nigga gon' stand ten toes behind her
Is it my fault I got good vagin-er?
Why the fuck is you humpin' on a minor?
'Cause she was lyin' on your dead mama (Ooh), on-on your dead mama (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Lyin' on your dead mama, on-on your dead mama
Lyin' on your dead mama, lyin' on your dead mama
Lyin' on your, lyin', lyin', lyin' on your dead mama (Brr, ooh)

Now listen up, Big Foot
You know I got a lotta tea
I went easy on you
Umm (Glass-fragment-foot-ass bitch)
You know, whenever I meet a woman that would fuck her friend's man
(And let your friend talk about your ex-friend baby on the internet)
I know that (No, no), they have a very evil spirit
Um (Where my prayer warriors at?)
I don't think you want the next installment of this song
I know it's the most attention you've ever gotten
One-flow ho, but, uh, trust
If you don't apologize to your mama in twenty-four hours
Shit gon' get uglier than KenBarbie, okay? Don't play
Um, and also, I'd like to say
To my supporters, I love you, may God bless you, you're amazing
Um, all the good-pussy gyal dem too, yes
But
I'm very serious
Ho, the things that you've lied about
Even pertaining to your mom
You don't want them out, okay?
Now
Since you think it's funny to speak about people's families
We'll all join in
We'll all play the reindeer games
Soon as your new nose heals
And soon as your—
Well, let's leave that for the second installment, rrr

'Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

Uh, yo, who want it with Nicki now?
I smoke ’em like hippies now
They see me, say, "Yippie," now
Homes runnin’ like Griffey now
They switchin' like sissies now
You niggas is iffy now
Bitches tune switchin’ up
We take 'em to Jiffy now
I'm thicker than peanut butter
He nuttin' like Skippy now
He want me to be his wife
His missus like sippi now, uh

Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (Oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (Oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won’t give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

She invites me to the condo
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago (Oh, oh)
My side piece, but she's also
Someone's wife, so time we spend is borrowed
But it's our moment right here, fuck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear, all nice and easy
As hair when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle (Oh)
She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, "All that old school hip-hop is over
Think that shit's got pneumonia"
I told her, "Bitch, now, just hold up!"
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital: we need Q-Tip for the culture
(Speed it up a little bit)
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I want to accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella—wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop, Hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights
They're just too high to reach it
I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire Mead pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic
Anybody who brings me up, duck it
Let me keep it 100
Two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband
Last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (Oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (Oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

Yo, now let me hit you back
Told 'em I'd get you back
I know you sittin' there just thinkin' 'bout who did you that
I am who did you that
You trippin', did you pack?
Can't post on Nicki block unless you sellin' Nicki crack
Here, take a Nicki pack
Check out this Nicki act
Nicki this, Nicki that
All these bitches piggyback
Ha, piggyback, ah, ah, ah back
Ah, ah, ah back, ah, ah

The man dem want digits fi dial (Dial)
Inna the dance, we a go skin out I know (I know)
And when I come out, y'all suicidal ('Cidal)
Yeah, on the real, I'm these bitches' idol (Idol)
Gotta be dumb to make me your rival (Rival)
'Cause I'm too powerful ('Cause I'm too powerful)
And you not powerful (Yeah, you not powerful)
So say your prayers 'cause you 'bout to die slow (Die slow)
Die slow (Die slow), die slow (Die slow)
Jealousy is a disease, die slow (Die slow)
Die slow (Die slow), die slow
Tell her that jealousy is a disease, die slow

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah)
Bae gave it to me (Hmm)
You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm

I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg
Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?"
Cita told me to stunt my ass off, that's all
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B-Boy, "Bad kall," that's flag talk
Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
The cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean
My bitch a vacuum
I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta
We get it, it's the same in each city
My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's
And ever since the pandemic
They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin', "Free Drizzy"
I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison
Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit"
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens
Just come and see about it, bitch
Tunechi

Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in
I am the standout, you just my stand-in
These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in
That's why I'm private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear can frolic
One Margherita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me "Nicki, cock the blicky," the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'
He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet
Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?
My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?
No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
It's corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me"
Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green
Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team
The K-I-N-G, the GOAT, plus me, the Queen
I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene

You know, one of the perils of makin' money is
You can afford to be dramatic
Y'all some drama queens, for real
It's all good, though
You now tuned in to the biggest ever
YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man
Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin'
Man, what's up? We in this bitch

This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches
Seen more plaques than toothbrushes
Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin'
All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin'
Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real
Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up
2021, I had to wet the streets up
Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza
That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya"
You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up
Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through
Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God
I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the GOAT
Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage
None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade
None of this shit's a mirage
Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green
6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, "Yes, I suppose"

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, "Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end"
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, "Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end"
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say, "We did it"
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways, I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel lookin' over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writin', this is The Pinkprint

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

You see a bad bitch coming through, yo, what's the hold up?
I'm in that new new, me and New New when I roll up
I tell the valet, "Park my Benz and bring the Rolls up"
Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
He see me lookin' pretty every time he scroll up
Might gotta let the blicky hit you if you stroll up
Now put your hands up, it's a hold up
Run me the money (Go!)

'Cause I be the baddie, B, Barbie tings, banging body B (Go!)
Everybody be on my D, yo, I gotta be (Go!) in reality
Suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach
Back of the 'Bach, back of the 'Bach (Woo!)
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody (Go!)
Ooh, you gotta see, honestly, on my odyssey (Go!)
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the, hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach

See, a bitch got more coins than a game room
So we ain't ever hatin' in TheShadeRoom (Nah)
See, I keep my sons in a playroom
So me and you ain't ever in the same room

I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' "push" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up, I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on

I slick, slick drop the top like nip slips
So he tryna smash like when the whip flips
I hit licks just to floss with this wrist
And when I leave my bitches we all say, "Kiss, kiss"
I'm in that new new De La Renta, channeling Bugs Bunny
'Cause all I want is karats and some big drug money
I'm only loyal to the niggas that'll bust guns for me
The jig up, it's a stick up, run me the money (Go!)

'Cause I be the baddie, B, Barbie tings, banging body B (Go!)
Everybody be on my D, yo, I gotta be (Go!) in reality
Suck a D if you doubted me

I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the, hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach

See a bitch get more press than a key pad
Before you suck me off, get a knee pad
See, I pull the strings like a tea bag
I'm prolly with my jeweler playin' freeze tag

I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' "push" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up, I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh, he love me, ooh, he love me, good for him

Get it lit without a lighter, let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed, I'm a bad lil' bitch and I never indict her

You ain't never have a bitch understand you, most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody that can add to, your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen, when you leave I say, "Damn, I fucking miss him"
I just wanna be your vixen, give you something real wet to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

Ayo, I just wanna be your first go-to, do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late-night on a humble
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell your niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest, bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters (Matters)
And they say, Birkin where the bag is, got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'ma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status
'Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite

Won't you let me be your favorite?

They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write "pressure" 'cause that’s what I apply (Brr)

Hold up, fuck-boys, ain't need no for you to roll up
Ain't no need for you to double tap neither, scroll up
Keep these bitches on they toes like Manolo
Be on the lookout when I come through, BOLO
Oh, woah, elegant bitch with a ho glow
If it ain't big, then I won't blow
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

Put me on a dollar, 'cause I'm who they trust in

I like him better when he got some sweatpants on him

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win (J.R.), to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Uh, yo, yo
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that'd kinda make the pain go away
Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin', but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, it's strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become Neo when they aimin' at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow, they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'
I win, thrive, soar, higher
Higher, higher, more fire

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Uh, yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanyes

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly

Mmm, uhh

Ain't yellin' cut, when it's shootin' time
Sign up, it's recruitin' time
Big wigs, with a suit and tie
And them big things got two inside
Fuck wrong wit' these ho niggas?
Don't do coke, I don't blow niggas
I don't tell niggas, I show niggas
And it's never less than like four niggas
(Four-four) Four wings and some french fries
Hot sauce and ketchup, nigga
He telling and he hiding
But real niggas still catch a nigga
Co-cop 'Raris, I don't test drive 'em
Home theaters, can't Best Buy 'em
These niggas that I roll with
Don't let a single thing get by 'em
Ki-king pins and them drug lords
Chi-Chi-Town, no gun laws
Broke bitches that talk shit?
Now them the bitches I stunt for
Malcolm X daughter came at me
Look-lookin' ass niggas ain't happy
Roll-rolled out with some Latin Kings
And some eses in 'em plain khakis
Smack bitches, no smack cam
Closed fists, no back hands
Pop-pop pussy on a hand stand
They suckin' dick like it's band camp
Call-call-call Webb and then call Nitti
Queens niggas in, it's all hoodies
Kidnappin' and then rob niggas
Call D-Roc for a biggie
Pussy ass little rap niggas
I fucked with real trap niggas
Pop star, i-icon
But I send niggas, come snatch niggas
I'm with EBK, you on EBT
Got a black nine, call it BET
School niggas, get a GED
And I tease niggas, make em B-E-G
Got a money fetish, I'ma fly to Venice
Got a big house, I can play some tennis
Lil Herb, what's good?
I'm a bad bitch and I fuck good

Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin'
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
1-50, I'm really with it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man 'round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it

I'm a young nigga, I be gettin' money
Take your bitch from you
And these niggas don't get no respect
I'ma stay 100 'til I'm six under
Matter fact, I gotta keep it 150
For every nigga that's gon' come with me
I'm on Roc Block with a new semi
And a blue Bentley, it do 160
Smoke a lot a of weed, like fuck kidneys
Put a dutch in me, got a .40 on me
I don't trust any, and if any nigga ever try to end me
I'ma die shooting, prayin' God forgive me
You too busy hating, you can't get no paper
Why are y'all so silly? Straight killers
I can call so many, I don't love no bitches
But my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki
I'm in Hollywood, came from Kingston Food
Shorties standing, in the streets with tools
Where I'm from we don't play no games
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news
Where I hang, we don't say no names
If you talk to cops, I stay away from you
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations
You'll be out the station, in a day or two
Dedication and a little patience
Lead to domination on my way to greatness
Don't put yourself up in a situation
Puttin' my relations, in your conversations
Shoot a opposition, with no hesitation
You get my position, then you better take it
Know some young bulls from a while back
Tryna leave the game but they never made it
I got old shit, killin' your shit
On a couple tracks I just never played it
Pussy nigga you don't want war
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis
Pussy nigga you don't want war
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis

Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin'
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
One-fifty, I'm really with it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man 'round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it

Gang, gang, gang shit man
You already know how I'm rocking man
This is G Herbo, shout out Nicki Minaj, you already know man

Got 50s in them TECs, 50s in them MACs man
30s in them Glocks, 17 shot Berettas, all that shit man
Sawed offs, pumps man what you want?

And I ride dolo from state to state
Even when I ain't 150 man Chiraq all the way to Queens
Let's get it
Uh-huh, I always got a trick up my sleeve
I might give you a new trick every week
'Til this album drop, I don't know

Ask Webb if I wasn't taking them trips, with 'em nigga!

Who had Kanye saying, “She a problem?”

I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket

I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body

You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named JAY, now you 'Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, yeah, you Nas, bae
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion, would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes, whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat, and tears in perfectin' my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
I’m Kobe, KD, Kyrie, pick a K

Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy

Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?

Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?

Runnin' with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde!"

Yo, I'm me, I'm Barbie drippin'

If he say he don't want me back, he be lyin'
Bitch, I'm the sauce, Barbie dippin', I'm the boss, Barbie sippin'

I'm all yours, Barbie kissin', call the stores, Barbie shippin'
Out or indoors, baby, I'ma floss
What? Why of course, Barbie tippin', I endorse, Barbie strippin'
Mink carpet, but I ain't got no flaws
Doors look like wings, Barbie sittin', bada-bing, Barbie trippin'
Curve niggas like they arm in a sling
Hopped off the swing, Barbie swingin', to the ring, Barbie blingin'
Good box, so he called Don King
Who the fuck gon' party with them dollies? No, I never do the mollies
If I hit you, then you probably gon' sue
Who the fuck gon' come through with the body, always lookin' like a hottie
Always sayin' what somebody won't do?
Who the fuck gon’ pull up in your city, lookin' every bit of pretty
With the itty bitty titty bitch crew?
Who the fuck gon' beat him with the .22 if he don't lose the attitude
And run off with his credit cards, too?

Fall off in the spot, every girl comin' like a shark
And you know my necklace, sittin' on ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl comin' like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fin pick you apart
Glowin' in the dark, fifty some' girls on board
Runnin' with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde!"

I just took her name and made that bitch a LLC
Stuff a couple stacks up in there, bitch, get on your feet
You'd make twice as much if you switch it up, just to see
To you, he's rich and famous, but he's just a guy to me
I feel like I'm King Kong, name still going ding-dong
It's two girls gettin' more money, and they don't rap, they sing songs
I stay with that pink on, pink furs and them pink thongs
Goons out if they blink wrong, think hard, but don't think long
Pink Friday had Eminem, spit hard but I'm feminine
Iconic trio on Monster, Goblins and Gremlins
What's left that I didn't do? You bit the forbidden fruit
You thought you'd get my spot? Who the fuck was kiddin' you?
Took a lil' break, but I'm back to me
Tryna make a new Nicki, where the factory?
They'll never toe to toe on a track with me
There'll never be another one after me
'Cause the skill level still just a half of me
Blasphemy, my niggas will blast for me
All these low IQ hoes baffle me
Tell 'em that I wash bitches take a bath for me
Bunch of trophies in my crib like a athlete
I see them giving fake love but that trash is weak
Man, you know that I ripped, every rapper beat
You know Nicki gon' eat, Bon Appétit
Used to get real hype off a half a mil'
Used to get real high off a half a pill
We don't pay niggas to front like they like my shit
We don't pay niggas to come in and write my shit, uh

Now carry on, now carry on
Now carry on, now carry on
Swish, swish, I'm just gettin' my Curry on
G6 flow, all Louis V carry-ons

I just took her name and made that bitch a LLC
Stuff a couple stacks up in there, bitch, get on your feet
You'd make twice as much if you switch it up, just to see

On blood, you made me, you made me, yeah, yeah, yeah
You made me (Okay), you made me (Haha, uh)

Yo, you made me do it, hoe, I told you, get low (Told you get low)
I'm popping tens, but they gotta be yellow
I'm New York Nick, I'm ballin', where Carmelo? (O.K. 'Melo)
I'm wavy, word to Shawty L-O, hello
How your jacket say Porsche and you never rode a Porsche?
How you supposed to make the quota when you never went North?
How the fuck you got Ferraris when you never went sport?
All that hoopin' and hollerin', still ain't scorin' on the court (Rrrr)

You made me, you made me, yeah
You made me, you made me, yeah, yeah
On blood, you made me, you made me, yeah, yeah
You made me (Okay), you made me (Haha)

Ayy yo, look at what they made me do, they made me do
Switched the foreign on 'em, navy blue to baby blue
Look at how they started pussy poppin' when 80 flew
All my niggas move that Britney, Ari, yeah, Katy, too
Niggas gassed on the really though, gas I pumped them
Straight trash on the really, yo, yes, I dumped him
Push the limits, I'm a pushy bitch, yes, I bumped him
Pushed past being filthy rich, ask I trumped them
'Cause I scare her, scare her, my biggest era, era
Never been clearer, clearer, don't force it, Farrah, Farrah
Because you'll never be me, that's word to Bella, Gigi
Dolce Gabbana, DG, pretty gang rated PG (Woah)

Now carry on, now carry on
Now carry on, now carry on

Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just plannin' a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three, three words that you're missing?

Where'd you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know
Ooh, ooh-ooh
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
Ooh, ooh-ooh

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game

Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you gotta use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved (To love and be loved)

I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm comin' undone 'cause the tears don't end

Where'd you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know
Ooh, ooh-ooh
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
Ooh, ooh-ooh

I could've given everything (Everything)
Don't wanna let the tears begin (Everything)

You think pussy's everything? Well, let's have a chat
A-a-a-ass out, pussy fat, point me to a rich nigga
Who gon' Rico, Ace me, pay in full my money, Mitch nigga?
I'ma help him fuck the check up, I'ma run the business
If your girl don't get it poppin', put me on your wishlist
Hitlist, now he sendin' gifts like if it's Christmas
He say, "Baby, every day we ballin'," I say, "Swish, swish"
Got him callin' nonstop 'cause he don't wanna miss this
I said, "Don't panic, keep the faith, nigga, B.I.G.'s bitch"

Fuck her in a helicopter, now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Fuck her in a drop top, now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Sent her back to who she with, now she screamin', "Why I'm with him?"

Oh, yeah

Do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine (Ooh-ooh)
And, oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't ever pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, "This nigga buggin'"
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

Do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine (Ooh-ooh)
And, oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song
So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Just another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

Do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine (Ooh-ooh)
And, oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?

I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back

Ayo, just last week I told 'em to pick a side
I bust shots, don't duck if it don't apply
Bae out in Paris, he told me to pick a ride
Sike, made you look, I still didn't pick a guy
I'm the trophy of the game, everybody tryna win me
Me, Olivier, Jourdan Dunn, my baby, Winnie
Partying in Paris, these bitches is embarrassed
'Cause they know I'm the queen, I still didn't pick an heiress
Mirror, mirror, who's the fairest?
You the motherfucking fairest, Nicki
What I drop on this watch?
I don't know, about a hundred-fifty
I'm who they wishin' to be
These hoes is on the 'Gram, Nicki pitchin' a ki'
'Bout to cop Neverland, Michael up in the tree
You got bars and still broke? You might as well took a plea, uh
Be in the bando or would you rather move weight, Don Pablo? Uh

Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back
Now I'm gettin' to it that way (Straight up, straight up)
I ain't coming through unless the bag straight
I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back

Ayo, just last week I told 'em they run done
My legacy could never be undone
I'm a prodigy, R.I.P Thun-Thun
Got these bitches shook, they shocked, no stun-gun
I'm the billy, billy goat, the GOAT, the GOAT's here
Vintage Hermès by Jean Paul Gaultier
Lagerfeld customize my gold chair
I run the point, you bitches just go cheer
Uh, look at my knockoffs, I told 'em knock it off
Anything that Nicki do, you know they knock it off
Put my crown on again, and I'ma knock it off
Anything with Nicki in it, they gon' pocket off
I mean profit off, my plug drop it off
You see them copyin' my hair, tell 'em, "Chop it off"
Uh, bad gyal whip, the top is off
You nuh see him downgrade when mi drop 'em off
Uh, I ain't never play the ho position
I ain't ever have to strip to get the pole position
Hoes is dissin'? Okay, these hoes is wishin'
You're in no position to come for O's position
I ain't movin' weight, but I'm in the dope position
I ain't movin' weight, but I'm in the dope position

Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back
Now I'm gettin' to it that way (Straight up, straight up)
I ain't coming through unless the bag straight
I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back

W-w-w-w-w-work hard

J-j-just last week, I told 'em to pick a side
I-I-I bust shots, don't duck if they don't apply

Shorty, I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
(Ba, ba-da, da, doh)
And for your loving, I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis

You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store (Ah) and I'm a toddler (Ah)
You got me wanting more and m-m-more of

Your love, your love
Your love, your love

He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a do-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
"S" on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me "mama, lil' mama," I call him "baby"

Shorty, I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest

And for your loving, I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis

He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lamb'
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha, he was a Samurai
Somehow, I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
"S" on my chest, let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon
Convict just like Akon
'Cause you know the snitches be putting the jake on

Shorty, I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
(Ba, ba-da, da, doh)
And for your loving, I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis

Find me in the dark
I'll be in the stars
Find me in your heart
I'm in need of your love

Tell them Kangaroo Nick, I'll box a ho
They said I got five and a possible
Don't go against Nicki, impossible
I done came through with my wrist on popsicle
Man, these hoes couldn't ball with a testicle, nigga (Ow!)

Your lipstick stain smells like a cheap hotel
Diamond watches and a gold chain
Can't make my frown turn around

The boys always spending all their money on love
The boys always spending all their money on love
They wanna touch it, taste it, see it, feel it, bone it, own it, yeah, yeah
Dollar, dollar, paper chase it, get that money, yeah, yeah

You get high, fuck a bunch of girls
And then cry on top of the world
I hope you have the time of your life
I hope I don't lose it tonight

B-b-b-bald head pussy got lots of juice
Lopsided on the curb, so I block the coupes
Watch the deuce
Man, I'm stingy wit my kitty cat daddy
"Did you ever really love me Steebie?"
Rrr, pull up in the rrr
Wrist on burr, pussy on purr-rrr
I don't even brake when I'm backing up
I'll swerve on a nigga if he acting up
I done pushed more sixes than a play date
Get money by the millions, fuck a day rate, nigga (Ow!)

Your bossed up swag got 'em drooling like a newborn babe
The dollars in they eyes got them blinded by a Masquerade

Because you'll never be Jordan, you couldn't even be Pippen
You couldn't even be tripping, you can't afford a vacation

You mad dusty, you a lil dusty possum

I just wanted memories with you

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase some with you
You

Look at you now, stuck in the background
Silence right now sounds so loud
Tried to let you go, you come back 'round
Look at you now, stuck in the background
Two seats in my two seater-er-er
Used to pull off on me, leave me hur-urt
Tryna front, but I know you do your dir-irt
Not nice, boy you know you do your dirt

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase some with you
You

Baby now you know you got nerve
I know you just wanna be heard
I'm a bad bitch, you ain't used to that
You gon' fuck around and make me do you bad
Used to creep, creep, with you through the back
I count up the cash and bring you the bag
I count up the racks like Serena
Plus I got that ass like Selena
And you know nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, not a bitch
That's gon' care, care, hold you down and love you like this
Drop down, turn around, baby show you like this
Won't find another one to ride it like a soldier like this

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase some with you
You

Yeah, and they say big girls don't cry
Baby, I cried
The real ones don't lie
Baby, you lied
I don't know what to do with you
Baby, now I'm through with you

'Cause you don't even know what you just lost
You don't even know what you just had
You don't even know, and that's what's bad
Money bag long, that bitch bad
Used to lay up in them sheets, they were snow white
Now you spendin' cold nights
You've been in the wrong so long
You don't even know right
Call my line, call my line, I'm like, "Please, boy"
You just need to leave, boy
I ain't got time for you
Just once, do somethin' for me, boy

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you

Sign of the cross, 'cause this is her last supper
Play wit' me, check who came wit' me
I bought a couple nines, plus the Ks with me
I breeze through Queens to check some bad bitches
I stunt so hard, assess the damages
'Cause this that "Oh," this is that "Oh"
And yes, I body bitches, go get the bandages
Y-Y-Y-Young Yummy, fuck you got for me?
I hate a phony bitch that front that chum-chummy

Big fat pussy wit' a icy watch

I am your leader, yes, I am your leader

Yo, when I fly, it's one letter and one number
You wack hoes could get hot for one summer
After that, the Queen'll still reign here
I'm Santa Claus to these hoes without a reindeer
Saint Nick, Ross, hey, Rick

Now I'm in the hood, niggas is gettin' woodies
Hit up Hot Topic, Nicki Minaj hoodies

Boarded a big jet and got a big check

You're not a believer, suck a big dick

Jealous niggas is gossip, watch me tie up my laces (Ugh)

Seven figures on watches; I told my mama I made it (Ha-ha)
Made a deal for my project; just give me ten mil', I'm gravy (Gravy)
I went back to the projects, in two mil of Mercedes
I get head from your lady; have her bill me later
I'm old school with the hustle, just gave Rihanna my pager
Heartbreak hotel, I'm in the A-Rod suite
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talking playoff seats
Know that boy busy balling, I like to play all week
Monday night with the RAW, I’m Vince McMahon with a beat
Power-slamming them hammers, I get you handled for free (Uh)
So where the fuck is her manners? She give me brain while I tweet
DM, in the BM, you "cm"; you bucket, you love it

Motherfuckers on my dick, suck it

I am your leader, yes, I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

But got imported from Tokyo (It did)

Only do the Aspens
Y'all can have the Poconos (Y'all can have that)
I'm Sonny, and you my son (Calogero)
Ride the whip, five on the hip
Live with the pies, got nine for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick
Oh my, know why? I'm fly as it gets
Now I need a Aspirin; she said, "You're only Cameron"
Girlfriend, you don't know Cameron from nowhere
So don't go tampering (Watch ya mouth)
You're just a nail, I hammer (Yup!)
'Nother girl that's on my camera (Yup!)
My name, you cannot slander at all
Girl, watch your manners (Yup!)
She run and tell her mother, "I think I love him, Nana."
Because you sat upon my lap? Nah! I ain't Santa (Nope!)
They call me "Pied Piper," OJ no glove I knife her

Never been a lifer, even do Rikers

Why would I fight? I don’t even like her

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

Even though I said I didn’t love you (Love you, love you)
I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, "Don’t touch me" (Touch me, touch me)
I lied, I lied

I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
Can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me, you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said, "Let’s see"
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fuckin' proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose?
You just a heartbreaker, won’t let you break mine
'Cause I’ll be smashin' windows and cuttin' them brake lines

I lied
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows? Who knows? So, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, "Fuck you" (Fuck you, fuck you)
I lied, I lied

I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D, yo
Man, it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it woulda been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic (Orgasmic)

I guess this what I gotta do to keep me from fallin', stallin' the truth
Who knew what you’d do if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool, I
I'm not your usual, typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Fallin' so fast, I'm afraid of you
So I lied

I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh, whoa

I lied, ooh, baby
Ooh
'Cause who knew that if I let myself go with you (Ooh)
It’s over now, goodbye, love (Ah, oh)
You’ll stay, you’ll stay in my heart (You'll stay in my heart) forever

Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday
You done, you tight? You suck at life?
You don't want a round three? You done suffered twice
Worship the queen and you might could pass
Keep it real, these bitches couldn't wipe my ass
Anyway, stylist, go get Bvlgari
I am the ultimate Svengali
You, you bitches can't even spell that
You, you hoes bugging, repel that
Let me tell you this, sister
I am, I am colder than a blister
'Cause my flow's so sick, and I'm a lunatic
And this can't be cured with no Elixir
'Cause y'all know who the fuck, what the fuck I do
I done put the pressure to every thug I knew
Quack, quack to a duck and a chicken too
Put the hyena in a freakin' zoo

Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

Bitch, twitch!
Bitch, motherfucking right, this is World War Six
This right here might make a bitch die
And this right here is gonna make a bitch cry
And if we being honest, I am such a great guy
And this what I do when a bitch breaks flock
I'mma put her in a dungeon under, under
No them bitches ain't eating, they dying of hunger
Motherfucker, I'm me, who the fuck is this ho?
And yes, maybe just a touch of Tourette's
Get my wigs, Terrence, go and get my beret
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am Roman Zolanski
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am Roman Zolanski
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
I am Roman Zolanski

Talking 'bout me, you talking about me?
I dare a motherfucker to be talking about me
That bitch must be smokin' a couple of OZ's
They want the outline, I give them a goatee
Goddamn, motherfucker, you talking about me?
I dare a motherfucker to be talking about me
That bitch must be smokin' a couple of OZ's
A-buh-buh-buh now give then a goatee

Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman

Take a little break, little break from your silencing

I just told P, "This really niggas' worst nightmare, man
They don't wanna see Lil Baby with the Barbie" (Papi Yerr)

Tell 'em my Nina, my bitch, she a rider
I got a shooter and I got a driver
They want that heat, I'm the only provider
Little bad foreign bitch, word to Fivio
Niggas know the vibe, that's word to Five, yo
Beef, we 'bout to resolve, yo
Pull up on a opp, do we have a problem?

Hmm, hold up, shorty, hold up, bitch
Please, don't touch me, look at my fit
Look at my ankle, look at my wrist
This one a pack, this one a brick
That one a opp, that one a lick
This one for Pop, this one for Juice
I am the one, bitch, you a deuce (Brr)
Niggas givе it up in my city
Really shed blood in my city (Get lovе in my city)
Niggas'll son your whole set like it's a round six
Clips, whole team get flyer than round trips, bitch
She's still spyin' on my flicks (Flicks)
He admirin' my drip (Drip)
Check what I do, the check will clear, too
Pull up like a drive-thru, so check your rearview

What's the point of havin' this muscle if you don't use it?
I play the game to win, I'm not losin'
Opps know my address, I'm not movin'
Brodie know to take it to trial, they gotta prove it
She get what she want when we screwin'
I'm on point, I know what I'm doin'
Way too smart to act like I'm stupid
I get my advice from Mike Rubin
I'm not by myself, my whole crew lit
Next year Chanel, I put her in that new print
It is what it is, I can't make no excuses
I hit the whole group, do that make me a groupie?
Balenciaga coat, this is not Gucci
We went city to city in bulletproofs
You can't run with my gang, they gon' bully you
Been had switches, I know what them fullies do
I'm a vibe, let me know what you wanna do
Ain't no fun by yourself, bring a friend or two
We be ménaging, that boost up his ego
She a lil' demon off that Casamigos
Yeah, Baby

Don't mean a rapper when I say bitches ride the wave
Floodin' my watch, but ain't givin' a clown the time of day
Ain't-ain't talkin' Christmas, wouldn't holla in my holidays

Heavy on the ski mask, too
And the ski mask ain't for the pandemi'
It go with the semi, paid a pretty damn penny

I'm a brand accordin' to what retail say
Yeah my tours be sellin' out on presale day
Plus I got the title queen stream, press replay
Testified for my nigga to the DA's face
One time for this super old PA case
I'm still schoolin' bitches like GA State
And I'ma still ball, call me T.D. Jakes
Bars for years, niggas thought I did a bid
I'm draggin' these hoes like Harambe did the kid
Shut the club down, it was poppin' then we slid

But if you thirsty, I own a sangria
Shout out to Fox Brown, I don't mean Pam Grier
I got a sign that say "Lames can't hang here"
Bats eyelashes, blank stare
He be like, "You came?," I be like, "You came?"
He say my ride game smoother than a Muslanne
Every time they count me out I be like, "You sane?"

Anything he need, I got on deck
And go to sleep playin' with his ballsack

Strung out on the pussy so I call her Crystal Methanine

Drinkin' a bottle of Henny through a straw
Bitch, you better stop that dialogue
'Fore I hit Carl and buy your catalog
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Sigh
How you fuck your mother man when she die?
How you go on Gayle King and can't cry?
Chile, bye
Big Foot, but you still a small fry
Swearin' on your dead mother when you lie (Ayo)

This lil' beggin' whore talkin' 'bout Megan's Law
For a free beat, you could hit Megan raw (Ooh)
If you a ghostwriter, party in Megan jaw (Ooh)
Shots thrown, but I still ain't let Megan score (Tell 'em)
Bad bitch, she like six foot (Ooh), I call her Big Foot (Brr)
The bitch fell off, I said, "Get up on your good foot"
Uh, still ain't topped "Red Ruby" (No, no, mhm)
Tryna steal the sauce, I said, "Get up out my cookbook" (Brr)
But really, I'm a sweetie pie
P-R-T-T-Y, but I'm P-E-T-T-Y
Um, why did you lie about your lipo?
Fuckin' your best friend man is crazy, you the type, though
You was lyin' to the queen, then you went lyin' to the King, Gayle
The thirty-year-old tea so stale
Kylie kicked you out and made you stumble to the car
Barbz, I need a good alcohol bar
Roman, wait, that was the bar
Like a body builder, I keep raisin' the bar
Fuck you get shot with no scar? (Brr)
This little piggy toxic, somebody adopt it
Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Shit'll get dark like chocolate
I'm 'bout to get up in your ass, bitch, clench (Woo)
Mm, yeah, sorta like French
They got you all them Grammys, but your flow's still a no
What a fiasco, Lupe
Future made you pay (Haha)
She wanna party with DaBaby while rubbin' on Tory toupée
I guess she needed money bags for them Trey Songz
She G-Eazy, Carl made her crawl for it
Yo, why the fuck they poke the monster?
Fuckin' with Nicki this year, ho, I'm comin' like a pornstar
She just mad that no nigga ever loved her
No nigga gon' stand ten toes behind her
Is it my fault I got good vagin-er?
Why the fuck is you humpin' on a minor?
'Cause she was lyin' on your dead mama (Ooh), on-on your dead mama (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Lyin' on your dead mama, on-on your dead mama
Lyin' on your dead mama, lyin' on your dead mama
Lyin' on your, lyin', lyin', lyin' on your dead mama (Brr, ooh)

Now listen up, Big Foot
You know I got a lotta tea
I went easy on you
Umm (Glass-fragment-foot-ass bitch)
You know, whenever I meet a woman that would fuck her friend's man
(And let your friend talk about your ex-friend baby on the internet)
I know that (No, no), they have a very evil spirit
Um (Where my prayer warriors at?)
I don't think you want the next installment of this song
I know it's the most attention you've ever gotten
One-flow ho, but, uh, trust me
If you don't apologize to your mama in twenty-four hours
Shit gon' get uglier than KenBarbie, okay? Don't play
Um, and also, I'd like to say
To my supporters, I love you, may God bless you, you're amazing
Um, all the good-pussy gyal dem too, yes
But
I'm very serious
Ho, the things that you've lied about
Even pertaining to your mom
You don't want them out, okay?
Now
Since you think it's funny to speak about people's families
We'll all join in
We'll all play the reindeer games
Soon as your new nose heals
And soon as your—
Well, let's leave that for the second installment, rrr

But I think it's quite clear now
You's need the bad guy

Ayo, I'm the one who run the city where they armed and vicious
Accusations on them blogs and they all fictitious
I done bent the realest blocks, pushed the hardest sixes
Keep a couple killers that don't care how far them licks is, look
Bitches act like they want action
Heard they want action
Bitch, we ain't duckin' no action
I'm 'bout to give them that traction, send a distraction
Then I'ma line 'еm like fractions
Took a break, I let 'еm live, look at all 'em eatin'
But these bitches gon' be mad once I call this meetin'
'Cause they gotta move around once the queen is queenin'
'Bout to put out all this crack 'cause my fiends is feenin', uh
I put these bitches on game, they should be kissin' my feet
I tried to give 'em some press, they tried to say it was beef
It's Nicki M, such a little gem
Bitches wanna be around me, but I do not fuck with them
All these diamonds on me flooded, I hope nobody gets stuck
If I pull out the Ferrari, then my shooters in the truck
I could still go to my hood, they know my body is good
Two million dollars to party in Saudi Arabian clubs
Poppin' them things to go up and smokin' Los Angeles bud
These bitches bitin' like Joe; shout out to Kamala, though (What up?)
It's them weak bars thinkin' that she dissin' for me
I graded your homework, bitch, it's incomplete
If you was tryna be my son, then mission complete
I'm the final level bitch they on a mission to beat
It's like COVID when the goat is on the track, the whole game stop
But I ain't playin' with these bitches, this ain't GameStop
If Barbie in the buildin', then she with a gangsta
He ain't gon' hesitate if I tell him to shank sumn
Just put a beauty parlor in my guest house
You mean the pink Lamborghini? That's at the next house
Fuck him so good, I got him walkin' with his chest out
I wish these bitches wanted more talent and less clout
I-I fall back, and just give them some space
'Cause when you already won, what the fuck is a race?
Look at them fuckin' for raps, oh, what a disgrace
I put that on A-rod, none of you bitches is safe (Uh)
Make his dick get hard soon as I brush up, but we tryna be subtle
Whole city go up when a bitch touch down like them niggas in a huddle
Sex game still cold, it's on igloo
Head game slicker than little miss Gorilla Glue
He tryna eat it up, I said, "Come and get it, boo"
While I count a mill', jigga what? Jigga who? (What or why?)

Make room when I come by, ain't speakin', I'm dumb high
Just heard niggas got jokes, it's a matter of time before one die
'Cause them dudes out and them tools out, all sixes like school's out
Niggas know if they talk slick, that I'm winter fresh, they'll get chewed out

I came out lookin' to party, and now I'm ownin' that building
You bitches can't get my spot until I start raisin' some children
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki, they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Moët
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I still got that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me
You better just watch your nigga, ho, I'm in that big boy
I am in beast mode, respect the G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches will get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car, that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them, but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tippin', you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed

Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, yeah I win again
Can't tell me nothin' about it, your opinion is invalid
Go against me, then you made a mistake

Yo, yo, cause I came out
'09, when promoters brought Wayne out
Lewinsky, like I couldn't get the stain out
I been bad, like cuttin' school and stayin' out
I been hotter than, vacationin' and layin' out
I sat back and watched how it was playin' out
They diss me, but runnin' and took the same route
Uhn, but no, they not Nicki
Wrist on ice and yes my wrist bricky
If I leave, the game will miss Nicki
Not a website but get money, this is fifty
Pop bottles with my bitches and get pissy
This shit ain't got no more integrity
Don't write they raps, and plus they flow shitty
Don't make me expose you bitch, I'm too busy
Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki still the queen, niggas all ready
Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki still the queen, niggas all ready
Soon as I came in, I told them that I would become the greatest
Muhammad Ali of these bitches, and that can't be debated
I never chicken'd out, skated, I know they mad that I made
All this money I made, all my bitches is laced

Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, yeah I win again
Can't tell me nothin' about it, your opinion is invalid
Go against me, then you made a mistake

So good, so real, so good, yeah
I'ma win again
I'ma win again, yeah
I'm Meryl Streep to all these bitches, they can't do what I do
Sometimes I just look in the mirror and I be like, "Why you?"
Yeah, I know that they mad
But I'ma shit on my critics some more

I am, I am
I am still gonna do, what He sent me to do
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
They know I am a champion
All champions do

It was just back to back like Wembley, dawg
Now you all the way back up in the Bentley, dawg
I turn lemons into lemonade simply, dawg
Old boy and my brother tried to end me, dawg
I heard they looking for the old me
A couple of you niggas still owe me
You asked for the GOAT so they sent me, sleeze
Tryna lay low, don't tempt me, sleeze
Thirty in the clip will be empty, sleeze
You bitches still my sons, learn your As and Bs
Leave the hate train in the station please
I was in the court, no Jays and Beys
Made her change her mind in the judge chamber, sleeze
The MAC's on the line, I ain't talking 'bout the PC
I'm the biggest fish in the pan, I'll do you greasy
All he gotta do is call, I'm in my T-shirt and my drawers
Face down, ass up, I'm already on all fours
Suck his dick through his shorts
Then I ride him like a whore
I mean a horse, I'm a boss
Yeah, I got the juice and I'm takin' him on a tour
Imitating Nicki while your ghostwriter dissin' me
Leave for two weeks, I got all of my babies missin' me
Never gon' fall, never not gon' ball
And I keep my nigga bustin' like a draco
He always come back, Big Draco
Still going bad on you stank hoes

Uh, haha mmm
Ahahaha, ahahaha!
O-kaaaaaay
They wanted the old Nicki
They wanted the old Onika, so
I had to, uh, get back in my bag
I might drop a freestyle every, um, week 'til the thing-thing come
The label hit me said they want the fifth thing-thing, I got in the studio, I did the fifth thing-thing
And then they say "You know, it's time to drop your single" I said "Noooo"
You know radio already tried to blackball a bitch
It's all good 'cause when you a legend, when you legendary
You shine no matter what
They get compared to me no matter what
They asked for the GOAT so I came through, bitch
But look, on some real shit, I'm 'bout to go on tour with, um, Juice WRLD
In Europe, shout-out to my fans in Europe
Uhm, I'm fucking three to four times a day, I'm feeling real good
I'm rehearsing for the tour
You know I'm sayin', pussy feelin' real good right now
Pussy like bald, like really bald right now
Like, because, I just be keepin' that shit so bald and so
That shit be so wet so, oh my, you know what?
Ayo, shout-out to my bad bitches, though
All my bad bitches know

Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen

She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em "Let's beef"
Changing girls, change is fine
She don't like girls, change her mind
Change the world, change my line
Never ever change my slimes
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes

I wish l didn't waste precious time the night when I called you
I wish I remembered to say I'd do anything for you
Maybe I pushed you away because I thought that I'd bore you

Listen
So close, but we were so distant
Wish I'da known in that instant
Ignored the hints or I missed it
I killed it
You'd always be in attendance
No flights, but always attеndant
Handwritten letter, you pеnned it
Them nights we wish never ended
Those rules that we wish we bended
Heartbreak that we never mended
Those messages we unsended
Best friends we somehow unfriended
Ain't care 'bout who we offended

What you doin', Papa? Hi
No, uh-uh, say hi

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own

You never got to meet Papa (I could lie, say I like it like that)
He sweet proper, he keep Mama on my toes (Like it like that)
I needed help, you booked a flight (I could lie, and say I like it like that)
In three days, you'd meet Papa (Like it like that, mm)
The waiting, the gazing
The painting, the raging
The ravin', the pacing
The praying, the shaking
I must admit, I was breaking
I must admit, I was taking
I must admit, my heart was racing
Telephone ring, he didn't make it
I just believed you'd awaken
A memory in the makin'
Call me
Won't you call me? (Call)
Will you?

Don't you know too much already? (Are you gone already?)
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own

So dear Onika, yes, where Onika?  (I could lie, say I like it like that)
Don't stress, Onika, so blessed, Onika (Like it like that)
Today, it's 12/3/23 (I could lie, say I like it like that)
Your baby's three, he's the best, Onika (Like it like that)
Set me, set me, set me free
Why didn't you come back to get me?
Let me, let me, let me be
Why would anyone want to love me?
Rich, yes, but are you happy? (Rich, yes, but are you happy?)
All this guilt you carry is heavy (All of this guilt is heavy)
You've already made your peace with me
One day, you'll have to forgive Mommy
But she knows you know too much already (Don't you know too much already?)

I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Yo

Ayo, tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we 'bout to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes, though

I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time

The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)
The night is still young (And watch the world pass us by?)
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly?)
So are we

Ayo, drinks on you, or the drinks is on me?
We ain't goin' nowhere like tanks is on E
We still gettin' money, what bank it's gon' be?
If he's sexy, he plankin' on me
So where them big boys with all of that? (Ayy)
Tell the bartender, say my order back (Ayy)
It's bottle service, he ordered that (Ayy)
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leavin' 'til we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day (Day)
So drop the pop and get low
And we could drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is "Don't lose," kyuh (Oh)

I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time

The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)
The night is still young (And watch the world pass us by?)
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly?)

It's a big difference between me and you
I ain't nothin' like you, you, you, or you
Uh

I'm on a whole 'nother level, these bitches is out of they league
These bitches ain't battin' like me
You bitches ain't badder than me
You bitches don't count and these bitches can't count, I am not the one, two, or the three
You bitches look up to me
You said you look up to her, but really you look up to me
I can't be playin' with niggas, I married a G
I got some niggas that do what I say, if I tell 'em to shoot, they pull up from the three
When bitches be rappin', I'm laughin', it sound like you tryin' to me
I'm who you dyin' to be
Will somebody cop all these groupies a ticket? 'Cause I'm who they dyin' to meet
I'm in the city, I drop a location and all of the killers come out
These niggas be frontin' for y'all, but they play the back when them killers is out
When them killers is out, cut 'em off like the scissors is out
When Barbie touch down, the baddest of bitches is out

'Cause I won, won, won, won, angel numbers

Lookin' like every designer fave muse
Front row, next to the who's who
Tryna build another Barbie doll, screw's loose
Name a rapper that could channel Big Poppa and push out Papa Bear
Ho, I'm mother of the year
Every summer, I come out to walk bitches, make 'em disappear
But to me, it's just another year
She ain't got that kind of flair, let me see what I'ma wear
They gon' copy, I'ma wear Moncler
Heavy on the arch (Facts), he was hittin' from the back
Then he asked was all this my hair, um, yeah

Spit your game, pop your shit
Face on pretty, ass stay thick
Beef with who? She got the right one
All these rap bitches, ain't got to like none
Kitty on fleek, I got the tight one
Pink one taken, I got the white one
These rap bitches you like is my sons
Still gon' run this rap shit when I'm done

I'm still sittin' here, you got a lot to prove
Appreciatin' my solitude
Beef ain't my go-to
But I got bags of this bread if we buyin' food
And I'm still queenin'
Chanel bags, they still swingin'
Old hits, they still swingin'
They love the flow, they still streamin'
But it's kill season
You apologized, but it's still treason
Got 'em steamin' like dry cleanin'
Move on my time and I ain't no demon
Hoes' words ain't got no meanin'
Queen of this rap shitty, Bohemian
They worst nightmare, they still dreamin'
Bitches jackin', I'm still queenin'
And I'm still prayin'
You would too if you knew
How these jealous bitches move
First .22 by twenty-two
They don't know the half 'til they cracked in two
So-called beef with who, wait, who?
Broke a couple rap niggas hearts in two
Now them ah chat pon interviews
It's clear to see they wanna be me
Hit the road, E-X-I-T
My flow, they B-I-T
Shots thrown, but I-D-C
Go home or do it B-I-G
My throne, they can't S-I-T
My crown, you can't F-I-T

But no, no, I can't hide who you are

You let yourself go, you don't represent O’
So trust me, just go
You settle for less, yo, you disrespectful
You was special, the new you just dull
So cut all that bull, the nerve of me to come off my pedestal
Come off my pedestal, money off that edible
Which means them bags stacked high
You ain't got the drive, my nigga ya pedal stalled
You said you wept, aww, every day, a queen you slept on
And I ain't talkin' 'bout your mattresses
But um, you the type of player I press eject on
I can't believe you played for that long
I never re-respected nobody
I never needed you, you must've thought I did
I should have copped the stick, but I'm teflon
Pressed on, headstrong, sex the bomb
Dreams of a bad bitch tryna F a don
If his word bond and he wanna sex icons
If he bust down and don't wanna waste my time
Who the fuck you thought you was, tryna stunt on Nick?
Shoulda put you on blast like a gun on hip
But it's okay, we gon' keep secrets, nigga
'Cause a true bad bitch ain't weak or bitter

My heart sayin' I love him while I'm screamin' out I hate him
And ain't no more debatin', this time, it's a ultimatum
I never forgot where I was at the first day I met him
Yeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him
I knew if it was meant to be that one day I would let him
Twenty years later, them decisions, I don't regret them
Just wish you would give me space when I really need it
To be alone in my zone when I'm really heated
Just 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you're defeated
Wish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed
Don't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it
Million missed calls, I don't wanna talk
Just did a detox, now I wanna spark

I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful
I made a song for you to say you're beautiful
You're so, so irresistible
Take me to somewhere mystical
You're so
Do you know?
For you, I promise I'll try
For you, I promise I'll try
For you, I promise I'll try

Uh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart
She bad as fuck but hard to deal with, and it ain't her fault
She got ambition like the niggas, and the vision for herself
So she can't rest until she feel like she done made her mark
So if you love her, then you gotta learn to play your part
Sometimes you gotta play the back
But when you do, make sure you play it smart
All these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard
They talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a rated-R
You like her, love her like a brother, like her manager, an A&R
Plus a therapist when it start rainin' hard
Her life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart
Yet you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across
But you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God
To keep the family together at a time when it's so regular to break apart
So God forbid, y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought
It's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath in your lungs
I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from
I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones
That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come
Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun
As if they life is somehow perfect and they never been plunged
Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done
It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none, for real

I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful
I made a song for you to say you're beautiful
You're so, so irresistible
Take me to somewhere mystical
You're so
For you, know
For you, I promise I'll try

[Song 78: Fallin 4 U]
95 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsEspañolFallin 4 U Lyrics
(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
Ayo

Told him shoot his shot like his main opp
Now I'm fallin' for him like a raindrop
Done that, run that
Yo, Patty, give me the gun back
When he say cock it back, gun off safety
Thinkin' 'bout you lately, JoJo and K-Ci
I be on that calm flex, them gyal hasty
Gyal, them want me face, but them gyal, they can't face me
I-I ain't really tryna let him in, in (In, in)
But if he a G, it's a win, win (Win, win)
Can't play the queen before the king, king (King, king)
Bitch, I'm the Pinkprint, tell him to kiss the pink ring

Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm, I think I'm, I think I'm fallin' for you)

They like 'em, they fightin', they comin', they tuggin'
I kill 'em, I beat 'em, I see them, they duckin'
Got pitbulls, we feed 'еm, it's nothin'
They never been official, thеy never been a issue
Plus they know that my body tea, my middle initial
I let him kiss the real, he know my looks could kill
These bitches gotta shake they ass to show sex appeal

Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you

Picture that, picture me givin' bitches slack
Picture pretendin' I ain't give all these bitches piggyback
Picture usin' me and the Barbz and never givin' back
Soon as they think they see the light, I turn the picture black
Ain't at the mall, but between me and them, it's a gap
Pictures sayin' that you the queen and knowin' it's a fact
Picture my hair givin' wet and wavy, strawberry daq'
Yo, matter fact, let me take that back before they steal that
Picture me openin' the vault, bitch, I seal that
Picture them disses stickin' like grits, bitches feel that
Picture me tellin' bitches "catch it," outer field that
Picture me not tellin' my lil' niggas drill that
Picture you endin' up under the sea where the dread at
Picture not listenin' when I said you would dread that
I mean locs, ho, you's-you's a chop ho
I'm number one, y'all go argue over top four
Clean sweep, you gettin' mopped, ho
Picture me dressed in black, they callin' me Miss Mary Mack (Mary Mack)
You get the picture (Get the picture), my niggas airin' that
Like-like married to the mob, bitch, I'm married to the Makk
Picture it not gettin' scary, it's airier than Max

Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I think I'm, I think I'm, I think I'm fallin' for you)

Ayo, you gotta catch me while I care, I ain't callin' for you
Watchin' my every move, thought I was fallin' for you?

Just met a boy, just met a boy, when
He can come inside of my playpen
'Cause he look like a superstar in the making
So, I think that I'm going in for the takin'
Hear through the grapevine that he's cakin'
We can shoot a movie, he can do the tapin'
Boom boom pow, this thing be shakin'
I ain't even tryna find out who he datin'

'Cause I know he got a wife at home
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playin' them g-g-games
I'ma run away-ay, I'ma run away-ay-ay

I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If-if you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight, and let me do my dance
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it you got it, you got that boom boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it you got it, you got that boom boom

Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He can become my little problem
'Cause it look like he modeling clothes in Dublin
So, I think he that getting that green, a goblin
Hear through the grapevine that he hang low
We can shoot a movie, can bang like Rambo
Boom boom pow, this thing so bingo
Wondering if he can understand my lingo

'Cause I know he got a wife at home
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playin' them g-g-games
I'ma run away-ay, I'ma run away-ay-ay

I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If-if you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight, and let me do my dance

If you got it you got it, you got that boom boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom

Boy, I'm in this club slow-mo
Don't mind if I do
And I can tell you feeling me from the jump
I wanna ride too
You got that hot shit, boy, you blessed
Let me feel up on your chest
Flex it, you the man
You the man, one-hundred grand
The same old game, blow
Yes, I play it very well
Come, baby, lay it down, let me stay down
Let me show you how I run things in my playground
Come and get this va va voom voom (Woo woo)

To never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
'Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I'll remain a staple
My career has been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em, "Think pink"
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh, shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophesy everything I'd do?
But, before I continue, lemme thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and E.I. told me it wouldn't be in vain
'Cause prior to me signing, I coulda went insane
And even now I think, "Do I really want this fame?"
Lemme get up and go
Seven hundred to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm startin' the show
Man, I'm birthin' these artists and I'm startin' to show

I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

Who I wanna work with? Nobody
Ninety-nine percent of them is nobody
Bitches actin' like they killin' shit, okay
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say they copped the soonest
Why these niggas goin' broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them ramen noodles
B-B-B-Bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club, then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday at Macy's, thongs and some pasties
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in there? 'Cause I must've missed it)
Twelve milli to kick my feet up
Get ready, this is the Re-Up

I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide

It peaked at #36 on Billboard’s “US R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Songs” chart.
This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now
This took dedication
This is meditation, higher education
This the official, competitor elimination
I was taking trips, with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens, to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up, crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This that: run and get a dollar for the ice-cream cone
'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Viola, Sharica
Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Aisha

It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erykah
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, "Money ain't a thang!"
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game
They know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at
Straight like that

It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo
Tell me one thing you won't do: settle
Give me one word for your chain: yellow
Pocket full of money, black cars; ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, A.I
Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah, I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don’t let me hit up Shawn Carter, hundred bottles of the Ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, hundred cases to my place, let's celebrate

It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

What up, Nicki? It's Nasty, yeah
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
'Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermedy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac, little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan just one year to finish
My list look like this, first thing you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life
Happily ever after
Champions

It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)

I'm on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin' (Feels like I'm blazin')
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin' (Uh)
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin' (Yeah, uh)

This is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I'm flying with a flow that is
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby, stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
'Rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire
Where we flyin', they can't find us, all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it, uh
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'ma grab your waist, then I'ma grab your face and
Then I'ma taste it, then I'ma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls, this just in
Yeezy hurt the beat like he fucked her best friend
And she let him back in, and he just did it again
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end
I'm blazin', I'm flagrant, I'm crazy, I'm sayin'
Too much for the world so they abbreviate him
His past is her fave, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just perf, uh, Prada colored beige
It's obvi we the ish and I'm rolling with my Brits
So real, you so trill, baby, everything legit
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our styles so diff'
They'll be jeal' when we in the mag lookin' magnif'
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas, I was tryna ad-lib
Add this, we blazin', Nicki, what you think?
I got two White Russians, but we also need some drinks

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin' (Feels like I'm blazin')
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin'? Know you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you and gettin' at you
Pickin' up dishes, throwin' 'em at you
Why are you speakin' when no one asked you?

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you?

What are we doin'? Could you see through me?
'Cause you say, "Nicki," and I say, "Who, me?"
And you say, "No, you," and I say, "Screw you"
Then you start dressin' and you start leavin'
And I start cryin' and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin', yo
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin' passive-aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peephole to my soul

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?

How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you?

Stop (Ooh)
Stop (Ooh)
Won't you just stop lookin' through me? 'Cause I can't take it
No, I can't take it (You see right)

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

Uh
Yo
Yo

It was back in '07, did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's, "Which world tour should I go on today?"
See, you told me I would lose, but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choos just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me, Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time
Tell 'em bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie, no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money, yeah, I'm Universal

I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?
What the fuck they gon' say?
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do
'Cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was crack
Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin, you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches, I could see your halo

I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely
What the fuck they gon' say?
What the fuck they gon' say?
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

It's okay, it's okay
Long as you know, long as you know
Long as you motherfuckers know
I'm the best, best, best, best, best, best

I hear they comin' for me (I hope they comin' for me)
Because the top is lonely ('Cause the top is lonely)
What the fuck they gon' say? (What they gon' say?)
What the fuck they gon' say? (What they gon' say?)
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)
I'm the best, best, best, best (I'm the best)

Smack my ass, grab my neck, got 'em cummin' everywhere
I'm a freak so I don't care, just don't get none in my hair
Now he callin' me wifey and he wanna introduce me (–Duce me)
Takin' me on shoppin' sprees, he wanna buy me Gucci (Gucci)

And I ain't even sex 'em, all I did was let him eat my coochie

Bobby V
Yeah
DJ, turn me up
Don't you turn this down, no, no

I think I gave him a discrete name
He replied with a street name
P.R. at the heat game
No ball, but peep game
He addicted to hustle, I'm addicted to fame
Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chillin', make a hell of a killin'
Don't I stunt on these bitches?
Man, I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em
When I'm done, I'm a don 'em
When we leavin' the lounge, I'ma keep it a hunnid
It went down, 'nuff said
Pull off in that thang, and it's blush red

Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'm gon' ya down
I'm gon' you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow

So caught up in this girl
Shawty got me love trapped, now
Can't control myself, 'cause I'm so into her
Cause we doing it like nobody's around
And when we doing, I can hear her make a sound
Shawty was singing like me
Had that girl singing, singing like me
She be like, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
Oh, I, I, I, I-I-I, I, I, I (Oh, whoa)
She looking at me like she want it
Like, I'm over here (Oh, whoa)
She climbing on top of me
I'ma make her scream, her scream like

Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow

Sit that pussy on my bottom lip
Then, after that, you know we gotta switch
My house so big that bitch came with a lobby
We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, 'cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday
I-I dig in that pussy, guess what I find
Tunechi Lee and Nicki, sex in the lounge

Sex in the lounge
Girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl
They gonna hear the sound of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happening to me, girl
Happening to me, girl, oh wow

I mean, I don't know if I like girls, I saw Sheila at Seraphin
Maybe we had too much tequila
Actually, yeah, we definitely had too much tequila
'Cause I don't know why I'm even playin' on your phone right now
I'ma just block you, bye

If these diamonds in my ear can't weigh me down now
What makes you think you could weigh me down? Stop it right now
Friends were pessimistic 'bout our love, heard they tight now
We both know they're miserable at home, fuck 'em all
If this Rollie on my wrist can't weigh me down, eh-eh-mm
What makes you think you could weigh me down? Stop it right now
Friends, they like it better when you're down, let's not talk about it
It's just you and me and

I just wanna pull up the Maybach and bend your leg back
Please obey that, don't delay that, my love, why lie?
Been a shy guy all of my life, we should change that
Pull up the Maybach and bend your leg back
Let's engage that, don't delay that
You're like a needle, life's a haystack
Friends they can leave us, you could stay back

I could stay back, I could take that
Come and lay back on our way back
Make a movie, watch the playback
Nah, don't save that, I don't play that
(Pon di, pon di), p-pon di buddy wining
I rap, but he wanna taste the icing
Gyal haffi, gyal haffi fi ah give me my ting
Commission for the game that I be providing
I was in Trinidad, let us consider that
Immigrant to a boss, bitches bitter and mad
Poppin' out like a cork, ducking 'em like Björk
Bitches get out of line, I give them one of dem talks
I tell him send a jet, a Valentino dress
He like the way it grip my hips, cuppin' my breasts
Shadin' like silhouettes, spinnin' like pirouettes
It gave nothin', bitch, thank you for zero, next
Damn, Drizzy, another bitter ex, shout out my intellects

I just wanna pull up the Maybach and bend your leg back
Please obey that, don't delay that, my love, why lie?
Been a shy guy all of my life, we should change that
Pull up the Maybach and bend your leg back
Let's engage that, don't delay that
You're like a needle, life's a haystack

I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone
Sometimes, it's just me and all my bottles all alone

That's why when I come around they hurry and run
And I know it ain't math, but I carry the one
Got a couple body guards that'll carry the guns

Run that back, Turbo

I just got 10 million bucks for shit that I ain't even do yet
You spent your money but I ain't say I was your boo yet
You got your feelings hurt, I ain't really mean to do that
I'm just a bad bitch, I'm sorry I put you through that
I'm from New York where we’ll never say, "Good morning"
Rippin' the block and he ain't come home 'til the morning
I always prayed to have a building with a doorman
Now I'm so busy I gotta turn down these endorsements
Now I'm flauntin' everything that I wanted
Remember a time when I couldn't even afford it
Now I'm in stores, I get everything that fits me
Chanel mink slides and shades so they don't know it's me

Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag soon as I get paid
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray

Uh, I'm still the same bitch from the city of the potholes
She say, "Oh, I got those," I said, "No, it's not those"
I don't fuck with birds, but you bitches on my cock though
If I want some chicken and waffles I go to Roscoe's
Cooler than the winter but I heat up like the summer
Fuckin' with my baby, I'm a gunna
When I say baby, I ain't talkin' 'bout Stunna
I'm talking 'bout lil' like Weezy on the come-up (Uh)

Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag soon as I get paid
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray
Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray (Yeah)

Couple new blessings every time we pray

Ass and thighs, that's where I'm thick at
Told his ex she ain't gettin' that dick back
I call Baby, "Yo, where that stick at?"
Tell that boy come get his shit back
If they act up, we gon' fix that
My new nigga ain't with that chit-chat
You know you ain't gettin' your bitch back
Yeah, I do it, bitch, I did that
Wish a bitch would, I ain't takin' my wish back (Woo)

Nobody move but us, it's a stickup (Brr)

No matter what, when I call, I pick up
Tell me all the business, I ain't spillin' my teacup

Co-copped me them cute double C's on my boot (Ah)

Send-send me with an AMEX, I don't need a limit

Big whips, I like his drip, big stick, a hundred clips
If it's givin' what it's 'posed to, I might put it on the lip (Woo)

I know a bitch, bust it open in the club
Introduce you to the plug, ten plates for like ten cash
I got a call, told him, "Meet me in the backstreets"
Got out the Jeep just to fuck him in the backseat
I'm not impressed, I said, "Yo, the D mad weak"
Hit my niggas up, I got him robbed and that ass beat
I told him that he had the chance of a lifetime
Who wanna be a millionaire? I'm your lifeline
These bitches always checkin' for mе like a Nike sign
Niggas always frontin' when thеy only did some light time

Beep, beep, beep, is that bleep?

Yo

Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin', tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW every time you came through
You was the brave heart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?
'Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see, for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was mainstream
I live the life now that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, I tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

This is the autobiography of Nicki Maraj

May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try)
(Can you hear me? Yeah) C'mon

Daddy was a crack fiend
Two in the mornin', had us runnin' down the block like a track team
When you burnt the house down and my mother was in it
How could I forget it? The pain is infinite
She's my Queen and I ain't even British
She's the only reason that I went to school and I finished (Kyuh)
She told me that I had talent
Got on her knees, and prayed for me when I started bein' violent (Okay)
She saw somethin' in me that 'til this day I don't know if I could be that (Kyuh)
But I'ma die tryin' and when I'm done cryin'
Grab the iron and black out like I'm retirin' (Kyuh)
Nightmares of you killin' my mother
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
And they should've thrown a book at you
'Cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you

May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic (I'll keep tryin')
My voice projected, my life reflected (Keep, keepin' on)
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try)

Damn, I wanna run to you
Hold you and kiss you, and tell you how I miss you (I miss you, baby)
Thought I would have a son for you
But now it's official, it's over and I can't let you go (Ooh)
But I gotta let you know
All the shit I did made me feel like I'm dyin' real slow
'Cause no one understands me
They don't know what to do when I'm hurt and when I'm angry (Kyuh)
You was my friend, and my man, and my daddy
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me
Anything I ever needed, knew you had me
'Cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me
So why I hurt you? That's the question
It took this long for me to learn my lesson
'Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
Finally understand the true meanin' of karma

May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic (I'll keep tryin')
My voice projected, my life reflected (Keep, keepin' on)
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try)

Please baby, forgive me (Forgive me)
Mommy was young, mommy was too busy tryna have fun
Now, I don't pat myself on the back for sendin' you back
'Cause God knows I was better than that (Kyuh)
To conceive you, then leave you
The concept alone seems evil, I'm trapped in my conscience
I adhered to the nonsense
Listened to people who told me I wasn't ready for you
But how the **** would they know what I was ready to do?
And of course, it wasn't your fault (No)
It's like I feel you the air
I hear you sayin', "Mommy don't cry, can't you see I'm right here?" (Yes)
I gotta let you know what you mean to me
When I'm sleepin', I see you in my dreams with me
Wish I could touch your little face, or just hold your little hand
If it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again

The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on
My voice projected, my life reflected (The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on, gotta keep on)
The more I cry (The more I cry), the more I try (The more I try), gotta keep on (Keep on)
My voice projected, my life reflected
The more I cry (The more I cry), the more I try (The more I try), gotta keep on
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic (More, more, more, more, more, gotta keep, mo–, more)
The more I cry (The more I cry), the more I try (The more I try), gotta keep on
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
The more I cry (The more I cry), the more I try (The more I try), gotta keep on

May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected (Yeah), my life reflected
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected (Can you hear me? Yeah)
May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic

I ain't really finna tell y'all how to get away with murder and shit

Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's
Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

I flew in from Trinidad, peep this nigga pressin'
I think that he popped a molly 'cause look how he sweatin'
I'ma let my niggas rob him as soon as it set in
None of you bum bitches can't sit with me and Gretchen
It's the biggest, a bitch ain't cough one time, it's the sickest
I don't never clique up, but they know who the clique is
Fast little bitches, but of course I'm the quickest
Mortal Kombat, ninja Nicki, who ya pick is?

Ayo, queen, got the customers out here, man
They lovin' this shit, man, they lovin' this shit, man
Where you at, man? Where you at, man?
We need you here, man, I know you in Miami

Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's

When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty-chatty
Got some real pretty titties, they come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm La Belle of the ball, you could call me Patti

Yo, you could take all of my bitches out to Abu Dhabi
Let one of my besties confiscate your Maserati
You should throw a party on the yacht for everybody
If we fuck your shit up, OMG, I'm very sorry
You could call me Barbie, 'cause I look just like a dolly
Yes, I bury them when they come for me, call me Halle
Since I finished her, my niggas call me the finale
I'm a busy bitch, I'm filthy rich, no time to Polly
Ayo, swerve to the palace, this the Queen’s like it’s Hollis
Put 15 million dollars, on it, ask LL, I'm doin' it
Don't get cute and ruin it, all my skill, I hone it
I pity opponents, it look easy don't it
(It look easy don't it, it look easy don't it)

Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them Percs, low-low on them Xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty, I ain't talkin' mani's

Yo, Nick, what's good? This ya boy Patty Duke
Man, you already know we got shit movin' out here, man

My tears have dried, and I know that no weapon formed against me will prosper (Go hard)
And I truly believe that my haters are my motivators
Young Money

If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold
Now they screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
(Hard) I am (Hard), I'm still (Hard) the one to beat (Go hard)
Ain't in a rush for mainstream, I am the streets (Go hard)
I am getting it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)
Go hard

Gotta go, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquee, everything sparkly (Man down)
Hit him on the walkie-talkie
Hit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells, bitch, buzz me in (Bzzz)
And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh)
Or a real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy
In the trunk or in the Lamby
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good
I don't wanna hear what you woulda, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up (Uh)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two)
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma (Uh)
These birds all fly south in the winter (Uh)
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle? (C'yeah)
I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle (Yeah), Louis on the duffle (Yeah)
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Hahahahahaha, no muzzle)
What you wanna do, do, do? (C'yeah)
Bitches is softer than Al Dente
Cut from a different kente
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas wheelie-in' them Kawasakis
Shout out to the Vackee's, saltfish ackees
Kisses to my fans unless I'm feelin', kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kind of rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski
Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed
Write my own raps, I gotta go, I gotta get me (Gotta get me)
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah), ohh

If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?

I'm still lookin' around for my competition (Go hard)
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)
Go hard

From slap-and-cry you start to die
So I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me
Just like Bobby know water
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp
But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown, don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nic'
They ain't fuckin' with me, they ain't fuckin' with Nic'
Your girlfriend her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nic, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip
Young Money dungeon, bitch, my swagger just punchin' bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun "Gunović"
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust, yes, I love my country, bitch
Hahaha, yeah, guitar


Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ohh

Wish you could get rid of Young Money
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold on
Now they screamin', "Nicki leave me alone"
(Hard) I am (Hard), I will (Hard), I gots to win (Go hard)
I'm still lookin' around for my competition (Go hard)
I am gettin' it in until the end

They couldn't stop me, even if the red sign did
Bitch don't get gassed, like a hybrid
These bitches thinkin' they can do what I did
These bitches thinkin' they can live where I live
But bi-bitches couldn't see me with an eyelid

Then I send him back to you like, "Farewell"
He give me left strokes, back strokes
Put that D all down my throat (Yeah)
No gag reflex, I ain't never gon' choke (Ooh)
Badass bitch, I ain't never goin' broke (Ow)
F-R-E-A-K
Can't mention the freak without AK, that's 'Bar, bitch

Freak, f-f-freak (How you gonna say, "No gag reflex, ain't never gonna choke?")
Some gyal ah freak, gyal ah freak, gyal ah freak, freak, freak
Ayo, New York, Malii

He wanna eat it, if he bite it, I'ma turn 'round and fight him
I'ma put this pussy on him, have him sleepin' like NyQuil
What's up, daddy? He like mami, I jacked UE's from Biden
I'm like, "Oh, just keep me fly", drippy stylin', profilin', uh
'Cause these bitches be eaters and bottom feeders (Uh)
I been had stripes like I'm down with Adidas (Uh)
Bitches on my body 'cause it's follow the leader (Uh)
Niggas on my body 'cause I'm hot like a heater
Price goin' up like a cab with a meter
Bad little bitty, they be fiendin' to meet her
Bad little bitty, they be fiendin' to be her

Whole lotta money like Nicki and BIA
Keep your two cents, bitch, this ain't a meter
I ain't talkin' Spanish when I say, "Señorita"
Told that bitch ghostwriter, "Yo, send your reader"
Oh, you ain't know, ho? Ask Wikipedia
These bitches hungry, guess I'm just greedier
These bitches ugly, my bitches prettier
Horseback ridin', I be like, "Giddy up"
When I touch a city, paint it red like graffiti up
I ain't gotta beg for sympathy from the media

Phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, Daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun

I could tell he the one 'cause they hated on him
Used to be a high roller, but I skated on him
When he went away, then I just waited on him
Came back, then I got X-rated on him
Never (Ah-ah), never hesitated on him
Even though I had to go up, elevated on him
Had the trap house, but it got raided on him
But I kept it real, player, never traded on him, uh
I mean, I wouldn't call 'em mini-me's
More like some goofy, doofy, raggedy-ass enemies
I mean, one thing for sure, ain't no forgettin' me
Me and my girls been them hoes, start weedin' them, uh
When the sun hit his eyes, like when a star-star tw-twinkle at night
Guys, I just can't say bye
Suddenly speak Thai, man, he samurai fly

Phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, Daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

I'm lookin' for my baby (I'm lookin' for)

Lookin' for my lipgloss and my liner (Liner)
Lookin' for me, told him meet me at the diner (Diner)
Got him smilin' 'cause he know I outshine her ('Shine her)
Had to pop up just to remind her
Easy lil' ho, don't know my M.O.
If I'm with your nigga, then just let him go
Can't sit in my seat, can't sit in my row
He been said I'm yes, he been said you no
He got that fetish for some pretty feet
He got that super bass, make my heart skip a beat, I mean
Red cups like double D's
Chanel bags everywhere, that's double C's
Uh, you rich bitch, bye, in your dreams
You know we gettin' to the bag, keepin' it a bean
(They said) They said what? Oh, yeah, I seen
We doin' great, Alexander, word to McQueen

Phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, Daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna have fun (Have fun)
Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna have fun (Have fun)
Just wanna have, just wanna have, just wanna have fun (I wanna have fun)
Just wanna have, just wanna have, just wanna have fun (I wanna have fun)

[Song 112: Up in Flames]
88 ContributorsUp in Flames Lyrics
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars, you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swam in
Airports that you bitches never land in
They be like, "What you doin', Nicki?" Brandin'
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landing
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed, B?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes
I'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

Want another round? Well, then get the ref!
Got the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next
When I fly, you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfuckin' queen, 'Lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is The Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-s-send 'em up in flames like a fireman
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot
Bitches

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

Going up in flames
Going up in flames

"She said, 'Fuck Fendi,' but I think she was playin'
I heard she move them things,, I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky—that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil' Kim—her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit? She from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality? She Chinese, right?
I mean, she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch—tell that bitch fall back
See, I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name Minaj—she a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Curren$y
But every time she do a interview, you know I run and see" (Trap-A-Holics, Holiday Season!)

That's why I spend my time online, leaving comments

Might hit up ThisIs50, MTV, hit up BET
Tell 'em pretty, pretty please don't play Nicki"

'Cause every time a door open for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers and statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
'Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetings (Kyuh)

Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask Chris—

In and outta town, be swervin' the Maserat-si

Who the hell is this?
Callin' me at 12:47 in the night
While I'm watchin' the fight
Lookin' at the phone, it's no name in sight
Blocked ID, knew something just wasn't right
It's my girl Kandi from out in Miami
Tellin' me that my man with some bitch in a Camry
Car seat in the back like he started a family
Yo Kan, stop playin', what the fuck is you sayin'?
Remember them chicks from the Bricks 'round nine six
That we seen when we hit a lick by the project?
Oh, you mean Leah, little sister Maria
I used to go see her in front of the pizzeria
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when
Some bitch named Kim
Light skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim
Followed them to the crib, but the lights real dim
They hit me on the chirp, warnin' me, now I'm warnin' you
What's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do

Damn, I'ma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'ma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'ma have to send her to her maker
I'ma send her to her maker
I'ma send her to her maker (Kyuh)

They heard about his good sexin', long erections
Nice complexion, Magnums for protection
They even heard about his tongue game
How the nigga give brain, ain't stop 'til the cum came
But that's words of Hip Hop
I popped the bitch top, like a Corona
Call a coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest-es
If I find out he got a next Mrs
What you think all the goons is for?
Two by the door, a few more out in New York
And I feed 'em curry chicken, I'm all about my green nahmean?
Got some fat bitches in the kitchen
I got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail
Got a scale for what's in the mail
I got whatever on my nigga bail, but if the nigga bail
I'll have him sleepin' with some killer whales
Damn, bitches wanna fuck with my man
On the other hand, things ain't always what you plan
It's the ones up in your prom picture, salon witcha
Now they wanna creep in your man Jeep
I bet you Nicki won't sleep
'Cause I'ma put the heat to your beak, you bird-like, tweet tweet
And watch I smoke like a cigarette
Should've left the bitch a pack of Nicorette
Leave all them foul bitches wet
I give a fuck about you and your bum crew
Mami, I'm the truth, they salute when I come through
I'm not runnin' bitch, I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'

Yo, police, open up
Shit, yo, this bitch Kandi set me up, yo

You know, I mean we-we wear straightjackets
And we-we-we-we stay in, you know, padded rooms
And, you know, and we fly away

Got my Mac Notebook with the Pro Tools

So I'm up in Mandalay, eating mangos
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star, they singing the “Star Spangled
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-banner,” and I, I am the rap Hannah
Mo-Mon-Montana, so fix your antenna
I keep three hoes, but don't call me Santa
A-And I’m, and I’m flyer then reindeers in the winter

And I keep a bad bitch on my GSX-R

Uh, thinker

Straightjacket crooked, I hear you lookin
I promise I'm hard and I swear you pussy
I ain't crazy, no, yes, I am
Right up in the cuckoo nest I land
I'm fly, now eat my bird shit

Wild animal on my bewildered shit

I get it before they cop it, always been that type of shopper
And I never tell a lie, I just put one in the sky
I just popped me a transformer, gettin' money 'til we die
'Til we die, we gon' be fly, made a milli' in Shanghai
I don't need job applications for that pressure I apply
That is why they gotta lie, that is just how they get by
But my flow still gon' be wavy and your flow still gon' be dry
I done fucked the world up in ten short years
Had teachers like Weezy F. and been all ears
Lose studs that's VVS, then get more pairs
They been prayin' on my downfall, still need more prayers

I'ma fuck the bag up and fuck your daddy
I'ma stay up like I popped three Addys
Girl with the blonde hair, they call me Barbie
Let's get faded and have a party, yeah
If you got that bomb, put your hands in the air
Bad bitches run the world, let me make it clear
When I leave Juice WRLD, I'm back to pink hair
Catch me somewhere fuckin' the blunt up and fuckin' on your momma

Fuck the blunt up, then fuck your momma (Uh-huh)
My VVS cold like a arctic tundra
40 on me, woah, you don't want no problems
And you best proceed with some caution, yeah
This song for the girl with the blonde hair
Suck me up good, give me Becky like, yeah
She ride it like, yeah, in a Versace chair
Her boyfriend heated like a grill, no Hibachi, yeah

I'm high as hell
Mind everywhere
Still mind over matter
Pockets gettin' fatter, elevate like a ladder
Thirty in that 40 make you percolate like a dancer
I'm colder than the North Pole, Blitzen, and Prancer
She say she from the strip pole, she a dirty dancer
Her ex-nigga too low, she don't got no standards
He ain't right, you don't live a better life
Run it up like Jerry Rice, I don't gotta say it twice
This is real life, your nigga is Fisher-Price
Now you read minds, you was thinkin' 'bout how I'm that nigga, right?

Fuck the blunt up, then fuck your momma (Uh-huh)
My VVS cold like a arctic tundra
40 on me, woah, you don't want no problems
And you best proceed with some caution, yeah
This song for the girl with the blonde hair
Suck me up good, give me Becky like, yeah
She ride it like, yeah, in a Versace chair
Her boyfriend heated like a grill, no Hibachi, yeah

Said he want the pretty girl with the blonde hair
Fatty on the Max like some Nike Air
Fuck his last girl 'cause I am her nightmare
Lookin' this good shouldn't even be fair
Said he want the pretty girl with the blonde hair
Fatty on the Max like some Nike Air
Fuck his last girl 'cause I am her nightmare
Lookin' this good shouldn't even be—
Fuck the girls that just hate on baddies
Shout the bad bitches that act all bratty
Nothin' but all this designer on me
All of my niggas throwin' up gang signs for me

So sweet
Mm

I go at nine, yeah, I got a show tonight
But I ain't been feelin' right, all I see is blurry lines
Baby, would you tell 'em for me? I can hear them yellin' for me
Tell them I'm in Hell, ain't funny (Yeah, I'm in Hell, ain't funny)
Baby, now you gotta do it, keep drinkin' a lot of fluid
I'll be here to guide you through it (I'll be here to guide you through it)
And maybe I ain't got it in me, maybe it's just time to end it
I'm sorry, may God forgive me? (Did God forgive me? Tick-tock)

So, so, so sad
So, so (Ooh), so sad
A bunch of memories (Memories)
A bunch of memories, baby (Baby)
A bunch of memories (Memories)
It's just the memories

Memories don't leave like people do
They'll always 'member you
There's never been another you
You

I 'member when I was the girl that everybody doubted
When every label turned me down, and then they laughed about it
I 'member goin' home and writin' fifty more raps
Just 'cause I knew you really wanted me to fall back
I 'member one of my first crushes in the fifth grade
He got killed, stabbed in the neck with a switchblade (Ooh)
I 'member when this girl in the hood thought she caught me slippin'
I got arrested, I assaulted with a deadly weapon
They say they hate Nicki, mad 'cause they ain't Nicki
All of the colors in the world, you couldn't paint Nicki (Ooh)
I never tried for that, these bitches die for that
I swear it, that's on my life, I'd never lie for that

Memories don't leave like people do
They'll always 'member you
They do
They do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Memories don't leave like people do
They'll always 'member you
There's never been another you
You (Memories)

I told Drake that he don't owe me nothin', never did
I pray that Wayne always remembered that I never slid
Look at all the shit that y'all threw at me, and I never dipped
Greatest female rapper to ever live, and that's on my kid (Memories)
I could've overdosed, could've been comatosed
Wait, hold on, Juice, I feel the baby kickin', holy smokes
I prayed for a son, my husband wanted one
If they ask about me, tell 'em I was one of one

Memories don't leave like people do (They don't leave like people do)
They'll always 'member you (They'll always remember you)
There's never been another you (There's never been another you)
Tell 'em I was one of one (You)

(So, so) Memories
(So, sad) Don't leave like people do
(So, fast) No, no, no

I can be selfish
Yeah, so impatient
Sometimes, I feel like Marilyn Monroe
I'm insecure
Yeah, I make mistakes
Sometimes, I feel like I'm at the end of the road

I could get low, I could get low
Don't know which way is up
Yeah, I could get high, I could get high
Like I could never come down

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can't handle my worst
You ain't gettin' my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

It's like all the good things
They fall apart, like
Li-li-li-like Ma-Marilyn Monroe
Truth is, we mess up 'til we get it right
I don't wanna end up lo-lo-losing my soul

I could get low, I could get low
Don't know which way is up
Yeah, I could get high, I could get high
Like I could never come down

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can't handle my worst
You ain't gettin' my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

Take me or leave me
I'll never be perfect
Believe me, I'm worth it
So, take me or leave me (Take me or leave me)
So, take me or leave me (T-t-take me or leave me)

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can't handle my worst
You ain't gettin' my best

Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?

Ice on his wrist, pullin' up in the six
Talkin' 'bout he packin' like a flight for a trip
Said he don't drink, but he might take a sip
Be on point when you come through to see me
He know all these other bitches really wanna be me

Ayo, one, two, check, one, it's fun too

I'ma keep it real with you, so please do not accuse me
If you can't do it three times a night, you're gonna lose me
Yo, babe, pass me the two-piece

I ball hard, don't ever owe them like Lamy
Ayo, these bitches lucky that I still ain't find a nanny
All of them is my juniors, Sammy, uh
They know I pop up like jump rope
If-If the queen Sleeze put a bag on it, then it's gun smoke
So we ain't playin' on the internet
I got bigger fish to fry, that's why I got a bigger net

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Tried to play me, but I shitted on him first
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
I stole his heart and then I put it in a verse
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
He caught feelings when I rode it in reverse
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
These bitches mad I did better and first

When I go, I can't take the money with me
Gotta keep a hitter 'round, they tryna get me, woah
Who real or fake? Sorry, baby, I don't know (Baby, I don't know)
They don't know me, but they always judgin' my life
They can't tell me who to love or fuck, it's my life
They gon' talk about me whether I'm wrong or I'm right
I don't need no more drama in my life
My life, my life, my life (My life)
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life (My life, my life, my life)

Ain't no prints on the jammies
But it still'll tuck that ass to sleep like your mammy
I pull strings without the hammy
Bunch of jealous bitches, but I know the real bitches hear me
A bitch hot, come fan me
A-and that ass still sittin' so I know they can't stand me
Sexy bitch, but my money real manly
Sealed your fate if you ever hated on the family (Mm)

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Tried to play me, but I shitted on him first
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
I stole his heart and then I put it in a verse
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
He caught feelings when I rode it in reverse
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
These bitches mad I did better and first

When I go, I can't take the money with me
Gotta keep a hitter 'round, they tryna get me, woah
Who real or fake? Sorry, baby, I don't know (Baby, I don't know)
They don't know me but they always judgin' my life
They can't tell me who to love or fuck, it's my life
They gon' talk about me whether I'm wrong or I'm right
I don't need no more drama in my life
My life, my life, my life (My life)
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life (My life, my life, my life)

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam all night 'til we see the sun

So, so hot in here, feels like a jungle (Yeah!)
Me don't like boys that ain't jumbo (Yeah!)
One time, bust a shot for my champion girls
Tell them guys super-size me a combo
Kn-kn-know I got the ammo, that's why I bulletproofed the Lambo
In the Middle East on a camel
Runnin' through the jungle, (Rambo!), Liberace (tango!)
Swingin on the vine, mango (Mango?)
So call me Simba, little mama, cause Mufasa couldn't stop a bitch
I fly in on that chopper, just to buy Balenciaga
It's just me, Mr. Miyagi, and the Phantom of the Opera
Goin' blaka motherfucker
Got that big, rocket launcher!

Uh-huh
(Sycamore)

Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions!
'Cause we pack shows, Celtics like Boston
You see me in the lobby, takin' pics and flossin'
After every pic gotta fix my corset
I am runnin' this shit, I am so exhausted
Batter up bitches, but approach with caution
You be talkin' slick, and honestly I could see why
You don't know me and I ain't talkin' 'bout T.I
Just when they thought I was done for the winter, I
Came out stuntin', I'm such a big spender, I
Two of everything but nope I'm not a Gemini
My life's a movie, take me to the cinema
Take me out to the ball game
'Cause you know I only fuck wit' ballers
Yup, them is my type of niggas, shotcallers
I been around the world, I'm such a bad, bad girl
I got the Austin Power flow, I'm groovy bitches
And no, you're no match for my Uzi bitches
I dumb my raps down, so I don't lose these bitches
Say some sex shit like, "Wetter than jacuzzi bitches"

Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch

I'm the baddest bitch
The mistress, I'm the baddest bitch (Kyuh)
I'm the baddest bitch
Trick, t-trick please, I'm the baddest bitch

Half a bar, just to laugh at 'em
High school, if he ball, throw my math at him
And if he wants some pussy, that's a no-no
I only fuck with bad bitches, no homo
Flow sicker than LL
Chinese and them things go pow-pow
Word to me, all them girls better bow down
Nicki Minaj, I'm the talk of the town now

Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch

I'm the baddest bitch
The mistress, I'm the baddest bitch (Kyuh)
I'm the baddest bitch
Trick, t-trick please, I'm the baddest bitch (Kyuh)
I'm the baddest bitch

43 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsHere I Am Lyrics
Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear, sometimes, it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percoce's
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

I am who I am
Ah

Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am

I am who I am
Ah

I swear to God, man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife, I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around, I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold 'til death do us part?
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe (I am)
Then you say I won't survive if I leave (Who I am)
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve (Ah)
I no longer need your attention, at ease

It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
Now it's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar (Here I am)

Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am

I'ma need sixty-nine real bad girls for my tour bus
Somebody get security to escort us
They go the long way, but we take the short cuts
Give me the blonde hair, long weave, short cuts
You know the flow sick, came in on the small bus
So give the D-cup, C-cup, small bust
They judge me like the girl's on trial
But every time that I come out, it's just girls gone wild
Got the domino effect, in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops, they got they asses hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call 'em cashews
Every other city, it's another Nicki tattoo
Steal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls
You know the real bitches love me, fuck the fake girls
So if you pretty, I sign titties
I got the key to every muhfuckin' city (Kyuh)

And when I'm in the A, I'm with Ciara or it's Keri
I'm feeling like a diva, then I hit Mariah Carey
I'm in the UK, I'ma see M.I.A
Superhero by night, r-r-rapper by day
And if I just wanna talk, I'ma hit up Monique
If I need a bad bitch, Angelina Jolie (Ooh)
Material girls like Madonna, model for Donatella
Ain't nothing you can tell her 'cause she get the mozzarella
She look just like Rihanna
She work with Wilhelmina, only rocking Galliano
She might be Filipino, be sipping Pellegrino
Be watching Al Pacino, she could probably sniff a kilo
Anyway, yo, hit up Grace Jones and tell her I said Strangé
I'm out in Paris, motherfucker, with Beyoncé

This is how it feel, when you winnin'
Man, they been rocking with me since the beginning, inning
This is where the stress ends
Feel ill, when you never gotta stress ends
Always in the press when
Paparazzi in the bushes, with the stretch lens
Say cheese to that, pull up on the double R, pop clutch on them
No, them strippers ain't mad, when I touch on them
Russell Simmons shoe game, put a rush on them
Send a GT vodka, sitting on top of
Mafia money, eating seafood pasta

Bitches lying on the kid, I won't leave for that, intimidated by my aura, where Rita at?
Send a GT vodka, in a helicopter, me and my Japanese bitches
In Osaka

South Africa is where I come from
Get me my banjo, get me my drum
Kidnap career, and don't take ransom
Don't let me come out of my dungeon
When mi did ah leave then take it down
True say mi come out of England and it done
True say the pattern come from Kingston
Trinidad, Trinidad, my island

I see you in here dancing
Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew you'd be so sexy?
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws, you're perfect in my eyes

And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

I bet you're hard as stone
Living in your world alone
I hope you let me in tonight
They want me to beware
You're dangerous, but I don't care
I can't wait to have you in my arms

And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

Maybe you're the master of disguise
And you are puttin' on and you're really the saint, the good one
Are you here to save me from the crowd?
If you are, then baby, take me now

Beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good (Oh, I didn't know)
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

There's a river that I go to and it heals me
Recently became a mama and it thrills me
Even when the water's rocky and it chills me
When he tells me to be still, somehow it stills me

Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

And no matter what they say, I never doubted you
I completely understand what you gotta do
Do what you gotta do
There's a river that I go to and it heals me
My cup runneth over, it ain't ever empty
Mm, when I'm gettin' my own, I still have plenty
Stop beatin' up on yourself, handle it gently

Blessings, blessings, oh, blessings

When I'm walkin' through the valley, I will not fear
I will never be convinced that He is not there, oh

There's a father who is present, and He sees us
Make no mistake about it, His name is Jesus (Jesus)

I found my peace in your presence, I put my faith in You
I saw the blessings come down when I start praisin' You
You gave me spiritual gifts I was afraid to use
Ain't never leave me
Always receives me
That's why they can't get me
I know that He is always with me (God is always with me)

I'm leanin on you, you baby, you baby
Trap-A-Holics

Yo, yo, I push, p-p-push it, I push it like I'm in labor
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me to love my neighbor
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
(Holiday Season!)
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nick of time it just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win, maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroine
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
(I'm so Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn)
Yo, write it down, take a picture, bitches, e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap (Female Rap)
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade, then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty-nose hood rat
"I love Nicki" scribbled all over you book bag (Book bag)
I love you too (Love you too)
I just wish your mother would've hugged you too (Hugged you too)
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road, lookin' for the Wiz (For the Wiz)
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill
Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D (They got A.D.D)
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school (Ready for school)

Yeah, follow the rules
Let me say my prayers and get ready for school
Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted
(I'll never forget it)

You shoulda left the other day
You let me beg for you to stay
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
And so, I pray you burn in hell, and you never find the ocean

I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep, and you choke on every lie you told
And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow

You piece of shit, you broke me down
Thought you said you, would hold me down
But I could see it in your eyes that you're blinded by them flashing lights
And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by

I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep, and you choke on every lie you told
And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow

(Burn, burn, burn...)

She go by the name of Nicki Minaj
Let's get this shit poppin', playtime is over motherfuckers
This the one they was waitin' on, baby
I had to do it

(Kyuh) Just when they thought it was safe to play, I
Hit 'em with the N-I-C, the K-I
I'm Tinkerbell, he's Peter Pay-I
To these rap bitches, I'm Mother May I
I wanna know why you waste your time
On these rap hoes that don't write they rhymes
Get a can of Sprite with a twist of lime
Money, money, money, always on my mind
Coupe color purple, no, I'm not Celie
We run New York like we play relay
My flight took off, yours has been delayed
Give it to them early bitches, so don't be late
Playtime is over, when I spit bars
My mixtape bring all the boys to the yard
All the boys want Nicki, all the boys want mine
All the boys say they love me, yeah, they love me long time
Yes, I'm the girl that they heard of, I commit murder
I body bitches, I don't need a burner
Queens, oh, yes, I rep Queens
Little white tee, plus some tight jeans
I make it hard for these chicks to breathe
Wrist on freeze, I freeze up my sleeves
We gettin' money like it grow on trees
Stay on my Qs, I stay on my Ps
After I'm done, then you will acknowledge
I'm the president, never went to college
I'm a bad bitch, I don't need no stylist
Tell a bitch, hollas when she get my dollas
Bitches talk shit, but what is you sayin'?
Got the illest dude in the game speakin' my name
I'm the one, I'm the one, you heard me?
Same number they stitched on McGrady jersey
If I show you how to do it, would you reimburse me?
Let me put on my pumps, let me grab my skirtsy
I am such a little lady, let me do my curtsy
Fuck a dry pussy bitch, 'cause I know she thirsty

Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?

Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
'Cause I pack shows, sell ticks like Boston
Pat your back, ho, why the fuck they coughin'?
Oh, I got 'em sick, better get that coffin
I say coffin, you can say casket
They're so trash, but where's the waste basket?
Where's my hat and where's my straitjacket?
Yup, they jackin', back to Maybachin'
Everything I do, bitches wanna do it too
I guess-guess you just skip to my lou
I just came through, I flew to St. Lou
Back to kill you, they blew like HQ
Why is it that they make Nicki a target?
Just 'cause this lil' piggy went to the market
Marketing steps, they marketed sex
M-Mark it with an X, they talkin' them checks now, now, now

Why you was secretive, frontin' like you friendly?
Why did you fear that? Held my career back
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that
'Cause now I see-see-see-see, all your run-down
Niggas better have my money by sundown
'Cause now when I come through, I'm stylin' on 'em
It's like I got hotter than islands on 'em
They say she got colder than igloos, did she?
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi
Just left Mr. Miyagi
Tell that bitch jump, if that bitch feel froggy
'Cause I got one leg up, in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck when that bell go "Ding!"

Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?

I'm me, don't you like what you see?
Won't you get like me?
'Cause you thought that I would die, but I'm fine
I'm me, don't you like what you see?
Won't you get like me-e-e-e-e?
'Cause you thought that I would die, but I'm fine

Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
