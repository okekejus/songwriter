[Song 8: When Love and Hate Collide]
9 ContributorsWhen Love and Hate Collide Lyrics
You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
Instead of slamming down the phone girl, for the hundredth time
I got your number on my wall, but I ain't gonna make that call
When divided we stand baby, united we fall

Got the time got a chance gonna make it
Got my hands on your heart gonna take it
All I know I can't fight this flame
You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby, time after time

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

I don't wanna fight no more, I don't know what we're fighting for
When we treat each other baby, like an act of war
I could tell a million lies and it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger, hits you right between the eyes

There's a time and a place and a reason
And I know I got a love to believe in
All I know got to win this time

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby...Crazy...Crazy

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
If you have a heart at all
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

But no chance if you don't wanna dance
You like a four letter words when you're ready to
But then you won't 'cause you know that you can

You say that love is won when you get some
But then your finger won't trigger the gun

So lend your love to me awhile
Do with me what you will
Break the spell take your fill

The flame has died and the fire has gone
Oh, this empty bed is a night alone
I realized that long ago

Is anybody out there
Anybody there?
Does anybody wonder
Anybody care?
Oh, I just got to know
If you're really there and you really care
Because baby I'm not
F-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin', f-f-fooling, ah fooling

Won't you stay with me a while?
Close your eyes don't run and hide
Easy love is no easy ride
Just waking up from what we had
Could stop good love from going bad

Is anybody out there
Anybody there?
Does anybody wonder
Anybody care?
Oh, I just got to know
If you're really there and you really care
Because baby I'm not

In the beginning, God made the land
Then he made the water and creatures, then he made man
He was born with a passion, love and hate
A restless spirit with a need for a mate
But there was something missing, something lost
So he came with the answer, here's what it cost
One part love, one part wild, one part lady, one part child

I give you (Women, women)
Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
(Women, women) Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them

And in the garden, lust began
The animal instinct, the wanton man
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite
And filling with emotion he took a bite
It was one part love, one part child
One part lover, one part wild

I give you (Women, women)
Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
(Women, women) Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them

Skin on skin
Let the love begin

It was one part love, one part wild
One part lover, one part child
A whole lot of fire, a little bit of ice
A whole lot of something you can't sacrifice

(I give you) Hair, eyes, skin on skin

Walk away if you want to

You can run, but you can never hide
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you
There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around and I'll be two steps behind

Take the time
To think about it
Walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around and see what you can find
Like the fire that's burning up inside me
There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all

(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around and I'll be two steps behind

10 ContributorsToo Late for Love Lyrics
Somewhere in the distance I hear the bells ring
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing
And the lady across the street she shuts out the night
There's a cast of thousands waiting as she turns out the light

But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late

London boys are gazing, girls go hand in hand
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand
And the queen of the dream stands before them all
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall

But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, it's too late
Too late

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-ohoh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

Woah-oh-oh-ohoh-oh


Standing by the trapdoor, aware of me and you
Are the actor and the clown, they're waiting for their cue
And there's a lady over there, she's acting pretty cool
But when it comes to playing life, she always plays the fool

But it's too late, too late, it's too late
Too late for love
Too late, it's too late, too late
Too late

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-ohoh-oh

Is it all too late?
Much too late?
Can't you see it's all too late?
Yeah, it's too late

But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late
But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late

[Song 16: Let’s Get Rocked]
10 ContributorsLet’s Get Rocked Lyrics
Do you wanna get rocked?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

I'm your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothing, in fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day but daddy don't agree
Because when I try to get away, he says, he got plans for me
"Get your butt right out of bed"
Stop bugging me
"Get up and move your sleepy head"
Don't shake my tree
He said, "Mow the lawn", who me?
"Walk the dog", not my style, man
"Take out the trash", no way
"Tidy your room", come on, get real
Sorry Dad, got to disappear
Let's get the rock out of here

Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Driving with my baby to get her in the mood
She's dialing through my radio and I'm ready to make my move
What she got ain't rock 'n' roll and it really blew my groove
It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me want to scream
Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins
Turn it off, that ain't my scene
Well, I'm sorry, girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question

Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

Hey, all I want to do is take a ride into the blue
Every time I want to love you, I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick and tired of dancing with this broom
I feel lucky today
Hey, look at that, man
Do you want to get rocked?
Do you want to get rocked?
Ho, it won't take you a minute
It won't take that long
So get on, get with it
Oh, come on everybody

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Do you wanna, do you wanna?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top of it
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Love to rock your body baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Let's get out and play, rock the night away
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

Do you want to get rocked?

12 ContributorsGods of War Lyrics
Feeling like it's all over
Feeling like there's no love
Feeling like it's not easy
Breathing life in the dust

On a countdown to zero
Take a ride on the nightmare machine
There ain't going to be heroes
There ain't going to be anything, oh

Here it comes, here comes the night
Here it comes, hell in the night
Here it comes, here comes the night

When we all fall down
When we walk into silence
When we shadow the sun
When we surrender to violence, oh
Then the damage is done
Put away that gun
I don't want to be there
I don't want to be anywhere, oh

Here it comes, here comes the night
Here it comes, hell in the night
Here it comes, here comes the night

We're fighting for the Gods of war
But what the hell we fighting for?
We're fighting with the Gods of war but I'm a rebel
And I ain't going to fight no more, no way


On a countdown to zero
Take a ride on the nightmare machine
There ain't going to be heroes
There ain't going to be anything, oh

Here it comes, here comes the night
Here it comes, hell in the night
Here it comes, here comes the night

We're fighting for the Gods of war
But what the hell we fighting for?
We're fighting with the Gods of war
And I ain't going to fight no more
(Stop)

Stop fighting for the Gods of war

Yeah what the hell we fighting for?
(What in the hell we fighting for?)
We're fighting with the Gods of war

It's a game I just can't win
There you are breathing soft on my skin, yeah
Still you won't let me in, so come on

Why save your kisses for a rainy day
Baby, let the moment take your heart away

Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone, you just couldn't have
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad

And you're the girl I got to have
I got to have you baby, yeah, oh, come on
There you go, midnight promises again, yeah
But they're broken by the dawn
You want to go further, faster everyday, baby
But in the morning you'll be gone and I'm alone

Why save your kisses for a rainy day

Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone, you just couldn't have
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad


Every dream I dream is like
Some kinda rash and reckless scene
To give out such crazy love
You must be some kind of drug
And if my time don't ever come
For me you're still the one
Damned if I don't, damned if I do
I got to get a fix on you

Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone, you just couldn't have
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad

And you're the girl, I got to have
I got to have you baby, yeah
It's a game I just can't win, oh

Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone

10 ContributorsBilly’s Got a Gun Lyrics
Billy's got a gun, he's on the run
Confusion in his mind, the blind leads the blind
Yeah, Billy's got a gun, he's going to shoot you down
He's got evil in his eyes, got a reason to despise
There's danger in the air

Can you feel it in the air?
(There's danger in the air)
Danger
(Such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?
(Oh, yeah)

Oh, he was locked inside a room without a door
His innocence he suffered for, in a world of black and white
They were wrong and he was right
Just looking for a clue, it's a nightmare come true
He's going underground to track that danger down
Oh, Billy, and why you got that gun?

Can you feel it in the air?
(There's danger in the air)
Danger
(Such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?
(Oh, yeah)

Never give him an even break
Getting caught is the chance you take
It could be your last mistake
(You could be so hopeless)
As a bird with a broken wing
Like a sheep in a lions den
Going to fall but you won't know when
(He's going to get you)

You hear footsteps in the night, see shadows on the wall
And the ghostly sound of silence, as the mist begins to fall
Then a scream rang out like thunder but the lightning was too late
As the rain came down on the crimson ground was the hand of fate
And a crowd of people gathered around but Billy couldn't wait

Can you feel it in the air?
(There's danger in the air)
Danger
(Such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?
(Oh, yeah)

(Aah, you better run) Never give him an even break
(Better run) Getting caught is the chance you take
(You better run) It could be your last mistake
(Yeah, Billy's got a gun)
As a bird with a broken wing (Oh, Billy)
As a sheep in the lions den (Oh, Billy)
Going to fall but you won't know when
(Yeah, the heat is on, he's going to get you)

5 ContributorsWasted Lyrics
Well I've been lying awake all night just thinking of you
But a bottle of whiskey lies heavy obstructing my view
I've got a bottle of pills to give me my thrills
And I know that I'm leading a life that kills

Wasted - I've wasted my time
Wasted - I'm shooting a line
Wasted - I'm stuck in a hole
Wasted - I'm losing control

And I've been meaning to call, I've been wanting to phone
You see I don't like the thought of leaving you here alone
Well I've seen things down here that are fit for a queen
I've seen things down here that should never be seen

Wasted - I've wasted my money
Wasted - I've wasted you honey
Wasted - I'm out of my brain
Wasted - I'm going insane

I'm running in thin air
There's nothingness everywhere
I've got to get out, oh won't you help me?
I've got to get out, oh won't you help me?
I've got to get out, oh won't you help me get out?


I thought I saw you just the other day
But it couldn't be you because you had nothing to say
"He's going away", they told all my friends
Well now I'll be stuck in here until the misery ends

Wasted - I've wasted my time
Wasted - I'm shooting a line
Wasted - I'm out of my head
Wasted - I wish I was dead

Official Music Video:
You held my hand and then you slipped away
And I may never see your face again
So tell me how do to fill the emptiness inside
Without love, what is life?
And anyone who knew us both can see
We always were the better part of me
I never wanted to be this free
All this pain, does it go away?

Then every time I turn around
And you're nowhere to be found
I know I got a long, long way to go
Before I can say goodbye to you
Oh, I got a long, long way I know
Before I can say goodbye to all I ever knew
To you, to you

From memory, there is no hiding place
Turn on the TV and I see you there
In every crowd there's always someone with your face
Everywhere, trying not to care


To you, I wish you everything
And all the best that life can bring
I only hope you think of me sometimes, oh
And even though I feel the pain
I know that I will love again
The time will come, oh, and I'll move on

I got a long, long way to go
Before I can say goodbye to you
Oh, I got a long, long way to go, got a long way I know
Before I can say goodbye, before I say goodbye
To all I ever knew, to all I ever knew
I got a long, I got a long, long way to go, long way to go
Before I can say, before I say, goodbye to you
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Oh, I got a long, long way I know
Before I can say goodbye to all I ever knew
Girl, I wish you the best I know, oh and all of the rest, to you
I got a long, long way to go
Before I can say goodbye to you

Union Jack is back with a hole in his head
He's getting badly burned every time
He's laughing at me and dancing on my sneakers
And his sixties songs are blowing up my speakers

I say, "You got no respect

You're just playing your dirty tricks
And then come crying to me"

And the whole damn world is really laughing mad

6 ContributorsTonight Lyrics
Aaah! Ooh...

I don't want to play the waiting game
And drift away leaving an illusion
I don't want to hide, it's foolish pride
To close my eyes a touch away from wanting you
Don't try to look away when you're face to face
I see your eyes that animal emotion
You don't have to set your tender trap
It's in those eyes, it's going to happen anyway

Moving to the rhythm of your heartbeat, yeah
I'm wanting, willing, touching you, we'll be
Moving to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Ooh babe, when you get that rhythm
Going to move into your room

Tonight give me love with no disguise
Tonight I see the fire in your eyes
Tonight so right, this night could be dynamite
Wait and see, if it pleases you it pleases me

There's nothing I can say, it's no mystery
It's in your eyes, those eyes are where I wanted them
So give me heart and soul, I lose control
Can't stop my eyes from falling into fantasy


Tonight give me love with no disguise
Tonight I see the fire in your eyes
Tonight so right, this night could be dynamite
Wait and see check it out


Tonight give me love with no disguise
Tonight I see the fire in your eyes
Tonight I want to win the greatest prize
Tonight so right, this night could be dynamite
Wait and see, if it pleases you it pleases me

When you come down here you're already on your knees
You want to ride white lightning then sign your name
If you want to dance with the Devil
You got to play his way, play the game
You got to taste that sweetness
Because you can't say no
But are you ready for the nightmare when you can't let go
Like a soldier of fortune when the money runs dry
You got rivers of bitter tears in your eyes

You want to leave but you can't let go
You want stop but you can't say no

You had enough but you just want more
You never get what you're looking for
You'll never laugh about it, never

You got both ends burning like a moth to a flame
You're going off the rails like a runaway train
It's a no win situation, there's no way out
And no one will ever hear you
Scream and shout


Run, he's coming to claim you
Run, nowhere to hide away
Run, you dance with danger
Run, oh, you got to ride the

White lightning on a dead end street
White lightning, where the deadbeats meet
White lightning, it's a one way ride
White lightning, oh, there's nowhere to hide
Oh, can you believe me babe?

Such a lonely road you ride
It's not easy when you don't know why
Such a heavy load you hide
You never leave no matter how you try



White lightning, can you feel it, can you feel it?
White lightning, it's so dangerous
White lightning, no promises, no guarantees
White lightning

I don't know how to leave you and I don't know how to stay
I've got things that I must tell you that I don't know how to say
The man behind these empty words is crying out in shame
Holding on to this sinking ship when nothing else remains

All I want is everything, am I asking too much?
All I want is everything like the feel of your touch
But all I have are yesterdays, tomorrow never comes

It's hard to hold your head up when you're kneeling down to pray
And the talking doesn't come easy now when the words get in the way
And if you could see what's going on behind these private eyes
The truth would look so easy now but I'm running out of lies


You think the shadow of doubt is hanging over my head
It's just an angel whose wings hide the sun
And it's myself I betray I can not wish this away
Took my chance now the damage is done, hey

4 ContributorsWe Belong LyricsSometimes I feel I don’t belong here
Sometimes I just don’t feel
I feel so uninvited
A wound that never heals
I need a little shelter
Just for a little while
Sometimes I hide the sadness
Behind a painted smile
If you cast the first stone
I will roll it away
I will kneel at your throne
Hold my hands up and pray
I will hold back the tide
Push the oceans aside
Save the day
But I can be stronger
You’re all that I am
You’re all that I see
The keys to the kingdom
Are waiting for me
So don’t hold me back
Don’t hold me down
Just hold me and don’t let go
You’re all that I am
You’re all that I do
The end of the rainbow
Is waiting for you
So tell me I’m right
Cause this can’t move on
Not if we belong

Whatever happened to forgiveness
Are the words too hard to say
What happened to the answers
They disappeared along the way
I hide behind the madness
Still looking for the clues
And there’s nothing left to chance
When there’s nothing left to lose
And the voice in my head
Screams the words I believe
And the light in the dark
Is the air that I breathe
You’re all that I am
You’re all that I see
The keys to the kingdom
Are waiting for me
So don’t hold me back
Don’t hold me down
Just hold me and don’t let go
You’re all that I am
You’re all that I do
The end of the rainbow
Is waiting for you
So tell me I’m right
Cause this can’t move on
Back where we belong

As you cast the first stone
And I roll it away
And I kneel at your throne
These words that I say
You’re all that I am
You’re all that I see
The keys to the kingdom
Are waiting for me
So don’t hold me back
Don’t hold me down
Just hold me and don’t let go
You’re all that I am
You’re all that I do
The end of the rainbow
Is waiting for you
So tell me I’m right
Cause this can’t be wrong
Not if we belong
The keys to the kingdom
Are waiting for me

6 ContributorsOn Through the Night Lyrics
The wait is done, the battle's won
So count the cost before you run
'Cause on and on your time was power
The clock on the wall ticks away the hours
Come on down, you're flying high
You'll never win if you never try
Stop the hate, carry the load
Come on, get this show on the road

On through the night
You can't stop me now
On through the night
You won't stop me anyhow

The stakes are high and getting higher
I'm flat on my face and you call me liar
I'm watching you, you're watching me
You're watching every move that I can see
My reputation's still at stake
I play it safe for safety's sake
Your ego and your promises
Are gonna fade again and again

On through the night
You won't stop me now
On through the night
You won't stop me anyhow, not anyhow

All you want to hear is the audience applause
You can't get on stage for a country clause
And the road ahead seems a little rough
If you want to know my feelings, I say that's tough, that's tough

Your wheels ain't turning, you're out of gas
You pay by check but they take cash
Two roads ahead but which to take
And you can't see it's your mistake
They're waiting for you, they're waiting for me
And what seems like eternity
It's all tradition, they'll get you yet
In rock and roll, there's no safety net

On through the night
Can't stop me now
On through the night
Can't stop me anyhow

On through the night
Going on and on, on and on
On through the night
You can't stop me anyhow
Oh no, not anyhow

[Song 51: When the Walls Came Tumbling Down]
7 ContributorsWhen the Walls Came Tumbling Down Lyrics
On the first day of the first month in some distant year
The whole sky froze golden
Some said it was the aftermath of the radium bomb
While others told of a final retribution
A terrible revenge of the gods

But we understood the grand finale
Fulfillment of a prophecy told many years before
So all that was left was...

All the women were captured and chained
And national suicide was proclaimed
And New America fell to the ground
And all the children lay crippled and lame
But all the nations came together
In fear of the thought of the end
No more would we fight in the streets
No courage had we to defend

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

A blinding light the sun had died
A new moon took its place
Tidal waves and open graves the fate of the un-human race
The city's heart no longer beats no pity have I left to lend
A sinner sits reciting Dylan it's now that I welcome the end

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound


When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls camr tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Nobody made a sound

Down!

[Song 52: Take What You Want]
10 ContributorsTake What You Want Lyrics
Love's complicated, love it or hate it
I'm in this to win
You don't have to believe it, take it or leave it
Just let it begin

From two different worlds we come crashing in
It's like a brand new day (ooh)
Stand shoulder to shoulder, soldier to soldier
So show me the way

So take what you want, take what you need
Take anything but just leave some for me
Take what you like, if you like what you see
There's a price to be paid 'cause it sure ain't for free

Life is elective, the unexpected
It's part of the deal
So don't try to move me, this ain't like a movie
This ending is real

From two different worlds we come crashing in
It's like a perfect storm (ooh)
Stand shoulder to shoulder
Soldier to soldier
So just bring it on

So take what you want, take what you need
Take anything but just leave some for me
So take what you like, if you like what you see
There's a price to be paid 'cause it sure ain't for free

All alone, return to stone
As the king is overthrown
The truth begins to shine
And it's mine
For now and forever

So take what you want, take what you need
Take anything but just leave some for me
So take what you like, if you like what you see
There's a price to be paid 'cause it sure ain't for free

(Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa)
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
(Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa)
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)

3 ContributorsLady Strange Lyrics
Ow
Ooh yeah
Oh

I never needed love before
Until I met you girl
A girl like you I have never seen
You came into my life like a whirlwind girl
You let me know what loving really means

Lady strange, oh lady strange, I want you
Lady strange, oh lady strange, I need you

You got me where you want me girl
So no messing around
You know I never played that hard to please
I've been here many times before
And walked this sacred ground
But this time you got me on my knees
You got me

Lady strange, oh lady strange, I want you
Lady strange, oh lady strange, I need you
Lady strange, oh lady strange, I want you
Lady strange, oh lady strange, I want you
I need you

Oh you're so strange
Oh oh oh

Taking love from you's like taking candy from a baby
But lady strange there is no stranger lady, no
Just you and me, we make love, good love
So let me know what loving really means
Woman please

Lady strange, oh lady strange, I want you
Lady strange, oh lady strange, I need you
Lady strange, oh lady strange, I want you
Lady strange, oh lady strange, I need you

I need you
I want you

[Song 54: Paper Sun]
3 ContributorsPaper Sun Lyrics
Does it hurt to remember
Does it help to forget
Do you know what you started
When you lit the fuse of regret

There's not a reason why you've come undone
There's nothing left to justify, this can't go on
There's nothing left inside as I walk this broken land

Because you're living on a paper sun
Blind to all the damage done
Living on a paper sun
Waiting for the tide to turn
Living on a paper sun
You can't hide and you can't run
All your dreams have come and gone
Living on a paper sun

Do you still hear them screaming
And does the fear make you run
Is the anger inside of you
A gift from father to son
I don't believe in you, you've come undone
I don't believe in what you do, this can't go on
I don't believe in you as I walk this broken land


You will discover the way to suffer
And like no other you feed the fire


Because you're living on a paper sun
Blind to all the damage done
Living on a paper sun
Waiting for the tide to turn
Living on a paper sun
Waiting for the night
All your dreams have come and gone

[Song 55: This Guitar]
3 ContributorsThis Guitar LyricsAt seventeen
I hadn't seen
The thing that makes us real
Then I found you
At twenty-four
I wanted more
When no one else would listen
You sang to me
You're my shoulder to cry on
You're the best of best friends
You brought fire to my fingers
And brought joy to no end
My brother, my sister
My lover, my wife
It's crazy I know
But this guitar saved my life
Broken down, border town
Feels like the end of time
Without you
You came to me
And made me see
Caress me with your honesty endlessly
You're my shoulder to cry on
You're the best of best friends
You brought fire to my fingers
And brought joy to no end
My brother, my sister
My lover, my wife
It's crazy I know
But this guitar saved my life

Me with you, you with me
The ghosts all disappear
Naturally
You lay to rest
My emptiness
And show the world your beauty
Through me
You're my shoulder to cry on
You're the best of best friends
You brought fire to my fingers
You brought joy to no end
My brother, my sister
My lover, my wife
It's crazy I know
But this guitar
This guitar saved my life

5 ContributorsRock Brigade Lyrics
Well, in the middle of the night and the early morning light
You can hear them a million miles away
They'll be banging on their drums, banging on your door
Waving their flags, telling you to score

Watch out for the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Oh no, it's the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Look out for the rock brigade
Leading you away, away

So when they hit your town you'd better get down
I'm telling no lies to you mister
Because they live for rock'n'roll they'll try to steal your soul
Might even try to steal your sister

Watch out for the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Oh no, it's the rock brigade (rock brigade)
Look out for the rock brigade
Leading you away, away

So in the middle of the night or the early morning light
If you hear them coming your way
Well you'd better watch your step, don't step out of line
Because here they come one more time

Watch out for the rock brigade (Rock brigade)
Oh no, it's the rock brigade (Rock brigade)
Look out for the rock brigade (Rock brigade)
You better watch for the rock brigade (Rock brigade)
I say watch out for the rock brigade (Rock brigade)
Keep your eyes on the rock brigade (Rock brigade)
Don't let your eyes off the rock brigade (Rock brigade)

Hey!

I see your cosmic fingers, a-pointing in my way
I see mystic vision, through the laser head
A stardust religion, it′s the end of days
A ride to the crazy on electric phase
When love took disciples in the pleasure of dawn
A scene revolution we can call our own

Hey-oh, wanna rock with you
Just like 72
Hey-oh, rock with me
Just like 73
Hey!

You move like a reptile
Your alligator skin
A chemical reaction
So let the games begin
My old private psycho and extreme machine
Spitfire better make your thing that's clean
Of universal lust, it′s so crazy cool
So turn on the "me", it's time to light up the fuse

Hey-oh, wanna rock with you
Just like 72
Hey-oh, rock with me
Just like 73
Hey!


A stardust religion, it's the end of days
A ride to the crazy on electric phase

For your backstabbing and side stepping
You're all sweet talk, you're all lust
You're the kind, yeah, I don't trust

And yesterday everything seemed okay
Yeah you better run and hide away

Stop your using and your lies

Fire it up
Fire it up
Fire it up

Born to raise hell since I lost my heaven
Couldn't find nine, kid, I'm on cloud seven
Cherry top lover with a chemical metal
Heater on high like a pot on kettle
Jukebox gospel, raise it up another level
Young street apostles with their hallelujah peddles
Preachers in the bleachers keep on dancin' with the devil
Swingin' with the king like an Elvis made of velvet

Bring the beat beat back
Bring the beat beat back (Woah-oh-oh)
Let me see you light, spark the dynamite, here we go

Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till you get what you want, you gotta
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till you get what you want, blaze on

Nuclear radio, kiss the devastation
Cradle to the stadium, burnin' on the pavement
Fishin' for religion on a mission salvation
History's the soundtrack, wake your generation

Bring the beat beat back
Bring the beat beat back (Woah-oh-oh)
Let me see you light, spark the dynamite, here we go

Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till you get what you want, you gotta
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till the damage is done, blaze on

High, high, higher
High, high, higher
High, high, higher
High, high, higher

Let me see you light, spark the dynamite, here we go

Fire it up, fire it up

Blow a hole in the sun
Till you get what you want, you gotta
Fire it up, fire it up
Blow a hole in the sun
Till the damage is done, blaze on

[Song 63: Blood Runs Cold]
4 ContributorsBlood Runs Cold Lyrics
I heard this line one time about trying to save the world
Have you ever tried to save yourself?
A wide eyed suicide drive remains a fake
As if you'd ever, ever go and make the same mistake
Strung out as the night comes crawling
Your halo of thorns is falling

Blood runs cold
I feel it in my bones
But you don't know your time is up
Blood runs cold

Somebody somewhere is screaming out the words
Do they ever really ease the pain?
I guess what I'm trying to say is whose life is it anyway
Because living, living is the best revenge you can play
This fall from grace, I see your face it's over


From you love was kind
Resolved left scarred and blind
Wasted and naked in the wings
Denying twist of fate
Demanding heaven's gate
Lying in wait above the wind
Strung out as the night comes crawling
Your halo of thorns is falling

Blood runs cold
I feel it in my bones
But you don't know your time is up
Blood runs cold
Blood runs cold
Blood runs cold

So stick around and settle down enjoy the mystery

You got this reputation for calling all the shots
I got your invitation so show me what you got
Are you man enough?
You got me in a cold sweat with a lingering caress
A bullet in your chamber with no return address
If you can keep a secret then we can make a deal
Put your finger on your trigger and show me how you feel

When you’re moving to the music you got voodoo in your hips
And the devil would approve it so the question on my lips

Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
To be mine
To be mine
Be my girl

You got my full attention when you’re movin’ ‘cross the floor
Divine intervention comes a knockin’ on my door
I got no time for talking, just need some company
Let your fingers do the walking all over me

When you’re moving to the music you got voodoo in your eyes
Let the devil try to prove it but the question will arise

Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
To be mine
To be mine
Be my girl


Show me down the river
Show me down the river
Show me down the river
Show me down the river
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?
Are you man enough?

A hazy way
Came to play

Came a castaway

Flows like a river
Going down to the ocean
Liquid dust, liquid dust
Floats like a stream
Going over and over
Broken glass
This too shall pass
That sensation of elation
Golden throne
Sits all alone
I should've known
That bird had flown

There's not enough hours in the day
And all the rains they came today
Liquid dust, liquid dust
Flows like a river
Going down to the ocean

Oh yeah
She was a foxy rocker, a roxy roller
An unchained sex machine
Yeah
Slipping, sliding, electric gliding
And boy she was mean, I said mean
High class dealer, sipping her tequila
Coming on pretty strong
Real love stealer, rebel rousing squealer
She said go but I said no

I kept saying no, no no no no no
I kept saying no, no no no no no

Waiting at the back door
Couldn't take it anymore
Didn't know where she'd been
She looked pretty neat, turning on the heat
And only seventeen, seventeen
Winding her up, bringing her down
She wanted it just the same
Said stick around, that's when I found
I only had myself to blame

I kept saying no, no no no no no
I kept saying no, no no no no no

High class dealer, sipping on tequila
Coming on really strong
Rhythm stealer, rattle off squealer
She said go but I said no

Well I kept saying no, no no no no no
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no

We dance on the ashes

Eyes wide open to the signs
And your bitter taste is such a nuclear waste of time

You get me started
You've got me up all night
You take me up and down and all the way around and round

'Cause you're
Dangerous
I'm addicted to your poison
Dangerous
I never felt a thing
Dangerous
And without hesitation
Dangerous
I will take you and jump right in

We're automatic
We're just static on the line
This love's divided
Just don't hide it, let it shine

You get me started
You've got me up all night
You take me up and down and all the way around and round

'Cause you're
Dangerous
I'm addicted to your poison
Dangerous
I never felt a thing
Dangerous
And without hesitation
Dangerous
I will wake you and shake you and take you and jump right in

Uh!

Dangerous
I'm addicted to your poison
Dangerous
I never felt a thing
Dangerous
And without hesitation
Dangerous
I will take you and jump right in
Dangerous
I'm addicted to your poison
Dangerous
I can't feel a thing
Dangerous
And without hesitation
Dangerous
I will wake you and shake you and take you and jump right in

[Song 73: Where Does Love Go When It Dies]
2 ContributorsWhere Does Love Go When It Dies Lyrics
Could you ever steal a prayer to deny your God?
Could you ever buy your love and not count the cost?
And could you ever take a life when all was lost?
Would it ever be enough?
Could you bite the hand that feeds and then ask for more?
Could you kiss the wound that bleeds, spit it on the floor?
Could you open up your heart and then close the door?
Would it ever be enough?

Every word you whisper
All the tears you hide
You die for love when it's alive
But where does love go when it dies?

If you came across your dream would you walk on by?
Hold a candle to the wind and just let it die
And is there room inside your mind for one more try?
Would it ever be enough?
I watch the time go rushing by it's like an ocean wave
Showing you no mercy throwing dirt upon your grave
You're drowning in the darkness and you're blinded by the light
And there ain't no prayer that's going to save you now
If you woke up from your sleep, blood on your hands
Would you wash the pain away? No one understands
There must be someone out there who can help you breathe again
Would it ever be enough?

[Song 74: Tear It Down]
3 ContributorsTear It Down Lyrics
You got the look of a howling wolf
I like it
The kind of eyes that could start a fire
Yes, I like it
A streetwise dynamo, I switch you on
And I watch you go
A thrill to touch, you're so hot
I'm coming for you ready or not

I'm getting ready - Living on the edge of a dream
I'm getting ready - Oh, switch on your loving machine

Tear it down - There's got to be a better way
Tear it down - I can't wait another day
Tear it down - There's got to be a better way
Tear it down - If only you could stay
All night long

I'm on fire, you're all ice
Once too much is twice as nice
Get tough, fools luck
One bite and I'm hooked
A black cat with a silver tongue
A quick lick and you're gone
One kiss, it hots up
Too close ain't close enough

[Song 75: Overture]
5 ContributorsOverture Lyrics
And with this message that I bring to you
A beacon of light to see you through
For the time is on our side
And a holy man does say to me
To always to be blind and never to see
It's not the way he planned it, oh no

The time has come to gather up your thoughts
For you have said your piece
The lords of light will change this land
From famine into feast
The buildings that once stood so tall
Have crumbled to the ground
The silver warriors who came in force
Are nowhere to be found

''Time is the essence'', the priests do say
To restore your faith in man
For the job you do and the role you play
Will help rebuild this land
Through empty streets and dusty fields
We'll fight for what we need
Protected by our swords and shields
We can replant the seed

The roads ahead are long and winding
On which the bandits thrive
But we have the power of finding
Illusion to keep us alive
So through the valleys and over the hills
We'll march and sing in rhyme
We'll fight until we lose our will
For essence is our time


The sun, the moon, the darkened sky
The morning dew reflecting in my eye
The rising mist, the dampened earth
Are just reminders of what life's worth

Whoa whoa yeah
Whoa whoa yeah
Whoa whoa yeah

And with this message that I bring to you
A beacon of light to see you through
For time is on our side
For time is the essence

[Song 76: Goodbye for Good This Time]
6 ContributorsGoodbye for Good This Time LyricsHow many times has tomorrow
Been promised to someone?
How many chances came
When tomorrow was already gone?
How many times will truth
And forgiveness stand in our way?
There's a lie in belief
The heart is a thief every time
Where does the future lie
In this godforsaken place?
The heart has a dark devotion
And it breaks you leaving no trace
This is a song of survival
But the tune is starting to fade
There's nowhеre to run
Nowhere to hidе anymore
It's goodbye for good this time
As love lies broken in two
I'd move Heaven and Earth this time
To cross that wasteland with you
I'm walking into the storm
Just as the night brings the dawn
I am reborn

It's goodbye for good this time
As love lies broken in two
I'd move Heaven and Earth this time
To cross that wasteland with you
It's goodbye for good this time
As love slips into the night
I'd move Heaven and Earth this time
I've one last battle to fight
I'm walking into the storm
Just as the night brings the dawn
I am reborn

She's a gold-plated lover
Twenty-four carat cool
She can walk on water
Yeah she can walk in my room
She's a one man woman
And it's a one man race
She's got a kiss like fire
She burns the lips right off my face
It's finder's keepers, loser's going to weep
She's personal property
Sealed and stamped, money in the bank
She's private, for my eyes only

She's personal property
Personal property
Personal service, personal touch
Exclusively mine, thank you so much
She's a heart stopping, brain thudding
Blood pumping, knee trembling
Spine crushing, tongue tying
Personal property

Yeah, and she belongs to me
She won't fall for nothing
She's much more than cute
Don't mind you window shopping, that's all right
But you ain't going to taste
My forbidden fruit
Adios, au revoir, wiedersehen, goodbye
She's personal property
Off limits, out of bounds, under lock and key
Confidential, for my eyes only


Now I don't mind you guys checking her out
You can whistle like a wolf or you can mess around
But let me tell you the secret of the sweet life
If you want to stay healthy, man take my advice
You better hit the road, Jack and don't come back
You could be king of the jungle
Or you could swing in the rain
But she don't need no monkey, not my babe
Because I'm her Tarzan and she's my Jane

She's personal property
Personal property
Personal service, personal touch
Exclusively mine
Personal property, she's off limits
Personal property, out of bounds
Personal property, under lock and key
Personal property, yeah
She's a heart stopping, brain thudding
Blood pumping, knee trembling
Spine crushing, tongue tying
And she's mine
And she belongs to me

4 ContributorsDesert Song LyricsDark and dirty like you have never seen
A mind so twisted with thoughts so unclean
My heart is racing all tattered and torn
I stand here naked as the day I was born
Only the lonely will stand
I'm holding the world in my hand
I got to believe
The sky is falling on this setting sun
Echoes of silence ringing loud and long
This isolation is the king of pain
A lost horizon in an ocean of flames
Only the lonely will stand
I'm holding the world in my hand
I got to believe
I've been here before
But not as I stand here today
I wait for the dawn
Ready to walk into the light

Love, love look what you've done to my heart
Oh, I should have known from the start
That you'd go and tear it apart
Oh, and now you desert me

You never lose, you never fail
You always live to tell the tale
You take me up, you bring me down
Without a touch, without a sound

Love, love why do I keep searching high and low?
You take me in your arms then let me go

Oh, how long must it be until you
Come and run back to me?
Can't you see I got no release from the pain
Just to see you again



Love, don't let me go
When will your love set me free?
When will you come back to me?

You're like a shooting star with a vacant heart
That's going in for the kill
We got a good thing going
So don't let it die
All we need is some love and emotion
All we have is a moment in time
(All we need) All we need is a promise unbroken
(All we need) And to believe in the dream
Is all we need
This ain't no bedtime story
This one you nevеr forget
You're like a night nеver ending

I can't control myself, don't want nobody else
Is this too good to be true?
You gotta dance just like there's no one watchin'
So come on kick off your shoes

We got a good thing going
So don't let it die
All we need is some love and emotion
All we have is a moment in time
(All we need) All we need is a promise unbroken
(All we need) And to believe in the dream

4 ContributorsAngels (Can’t Help You Now) LyricsIt's a slow news day
But it's gonna happen anyway
Lock it up and lose the key
A truth we'll never see
Is just thrown away
And hidden from us everyday
A secret that just has to be
Is buried on page thirty three
It's slippin' away
It's slippin' away
Don't let it break you down
It's slippin' away
It's slippin' away
Don't let it break you
Another deadline lost
Another promise gone at any cost
You can't see the damage done
A battle never won
If only you could see
Your fingerprints all over me
Savaged by your poison hand
Your wishes never my command
It's slippin' away
It's slippin' away
Don't let it break you down
It's slippin' away
It's slippin' away
Don't let it brеak you

Angels can't help you now
Therе's no time to reason why
Angels can't help you now
And it's too late to even try
Angels can't help you now
And with the touch of your hand
You cast your shadow over the sun
And now it's done
Angels can't help you now
There's no time to reason why
Angels can't help you now
And it's too late to even try
Angels can't help you now
'Cause with the touch of your hand
You cast your shadow over the sun
Angels can't help you now
There's no time to turn around
Angels can't help you now
'Cause it's such a long way down
Angels can't help you now
And in the palm of my hand
The one thing that can still make me feel
The one thing with the power to heal

There's a crack in the sky
So say your goodbyes
Welcome to the end of the end

Day and night, black and white
You take it all for granted
I'm the one who turns you on
When you don't know where you belong
And nothing seems to matter
I'm the one who's holding on
It's alright to be wrong
All we need's a little time
But nothing here can last that long

We show the world a brand new face
It's taken us all this time
All this time
All of this doubt
We get to work it out
All of this doubt
We get to work it out

Yesterday you lost your way
Still looking for an answer
I'm the one who holds the key
When you don't know where you belong
And nothing seems to matter
I'll unlock this mystery


Day and night, black and white
Take it all for granted
(We get to work it out)
I'm the one who turns you on
Turns you on, turns you on
(All of this doubt)

When you don't know where you belong
And nothing seems to matter
(We get to work it out)
I'm the one who's holding on
Holding on, holding on

5 ContributorsBreathe a Sigh Lyrics
Let me down slow and easy
Because there ain't nothing I can do
I hope and pray, my faith won't leave me
When it comes down to me and you

Try a little tenderness
I die a little
For a long lost sweet caress

You lying next to me
Fulfilled some destiny
I want to cry
But I breathe a sigh
Just a little bit of letting go
I don't want you to know
I want to cry
But I breathe a sigh

Overflow of emotion
And a hurt that'll never heal
If you close the door forever
The fate of pain is sealed



I more than long for your affection
You tell me now that ain't so
Not even gentle persuasion
Is ever going to let me go


Won't you let me breathe?
Won't you let me breathe?
Let me breathe
Won't you let me breathe?
Breathe a sigh
Won't you let me breathe?
Won't you let me breathe?
Breathe a sigh
Won't you let me breathe?

There's a hole where my heart used to be?
Set me free
From here to eternity
Do you still hear me
When I call your name?
My constant companions
Are heartache and shame
Now there's a good reason
They're one and the same
I pulled out my gun
You had nowhere to run
As I watched you get shot down in flames
Yes, it's true
I did what I did for you
Can't you see
There's a hole where my heart used to be?
Set me free
From here to eternity
The devil may take me
But you're not to blame
Just a fatal attraction
That I can't explain
So, lord give me shelter
From out of the rain

There's no sideways glances
I'm all out of chances
They're coming to take me away
Yes, it's true
But what more could I do for you?
Can't you see
There's a hole where my heart used to be?
Set me free
From here to eternity
As we walk into the dark and slam the door
Our souls are entwined forevermore
Broken to the core

Set me free (Set me free, baby)
From here to eternity (Oh-oh)

Like a land from outer space

Liberation is what I need
Desperation is following me
If only I could feel like I'm gonna be

Touched by the wings of an angel
Gabriel lay your hands on me
And now the voice of reason
Has nothing left to say
There's rebels in the kingdom
As heaven looks away

If you could see the darkness fall
But your spirit walks right through me
Like a shadow on my soul

Touch me touch me please

You're always pretending to be
Someone who prefers to be free

And can't you see that it's true

Trying so hard, so hard to get through
And why can't everyone see
The way that it really should be
Why hide your feelings and suffer the pain

I can't sleep when I know you're not around

Look at my face I'm about to replace
Every hurt, every tear that you cry

Because when you feel this strong and you can't go on
There's nothing wrong, just try to realize
You won't ever have to say goodbye
You won't ever have to say, "I've wasted all my time"
If the dream you dream ain't what it seems just look into my eyes
You won't ever have to say goodbye

I'm just praying, hear me saying
I'd be there if the sun refused to shine
As the night gets colder I will be your shoulder
I give you my heart until death us do part
Every day, every moment, forever

Won't you save me?
Don't you blame me?

Sentence rape me

I got the fear that I am gone, turn to dust

Slave or sympathy it atrophies
Save the ancient hearts
Hiding scars and knives in symphonies
Still we rise to fall

And the world is wide open
It's fallen for a beautiful lie
We're in this too deep
The timeline is broken
Just like a shadow frozen in time
Open your eyes
'Cause looking up ain't what it seems
When it crushes all your dreams
Open your eyes
Oh, this feeling's nothing new
So let the truth wash over you
I'm tired of this game
Come down from your mountain
We're lost in all this darkness and fear
And all that we crave
Is a seat at your table
Come feed us, watch this pain disappear
Open your eyes
'Cause looking up ain't what it seems
When it crushes all your dreams
Open your eyes
Oh, this feeling's nothing new
So let the truth wash over you

So, what have we done?
Heaven knows which way we'll go
As we lie wide awake and dreaming
We stare at the sun
Watch the dying of the light
As the colours turn to black and white
Open your eyes
'Cause looking up ain't what it seems
When it crushes all your dreams
Open your eyes
Oh, this feeling's nothing new
So let the truth wash over you

Can't you see I can't deny
I'm out of here like I'm on fire

Living like a caged-up animal, criminal
Television newsman so subliminal
Bringing down the walls of wonderland
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me
Everything and everyone and all the things I ought to be
Here I am, your demolition man

Steal your car and leave a wreck
Kiss your bride, I cash your check
And Tyson plus I'm ripped and torn
Been on the edge since I was born
I kick the jukebox, change the tune
I break the bank and jump the moon
I sink the fleet to catch a buzz
And raise a glass for all of us



I'm a beast in space, I'm an acid taste
I'm a primitive gong stuffed in your face
It's enough to bring you to your knees

[Song 97: Love Don’t Lie]
2 ContributorsLove Don’t Lie Lyrics
Yeah, whoa

Time, just watching the time slipping away
Give me a sign, where do you go when you can't find the way
So we watch and we wait and we crawl and we kneel
If you know who you are then you know how to feel
In time, maybe temptation is all that you need

Love don't lie, it lifts you up
Takes you higher when high ain't enough
Love don't lie, it's stronger than steel
It's got the heart and emotion to heal
It's not as easy as it seems
When you can't even speak in your dreams
Love don't lie and that's the truth
Look me straight in the eye for the proof
That love don't lie
Yeah, love don't lie

Out in the cold, with a love that burns like the sun
You've stolen my soul, so justice would seem to be done
So we hope and we pray and we live and we learn
If we know where we are then we know where to turn
In time, maybe persuasion is all that you need


Love don't lie, it lifts you up
Takes you higher when high ain't enough
Love don't lie, it's stronger than steel
It's got the heart and emotion to heal
Love don't lie, it lifts you up
Takes you higher when high ain't enough
Love don't lie and that's the truth
Look me straight in the eye, straight in the eye for the proof
Love don't lie
Yeah, love don't lie
Oh, oh, love don't lie
Yeah, love don't lie

[Song 98: Unbreakable]
4 ContributorsUnbreakable LyricsI'm heading for a heartache
'Cause there's a hurricane coming my way
Can't hold me down forever
So cut me loose before I fade away
I'm not ready for judgement day
This ain't no make believe but
I should've listened to my heart this time
'Cause I can barely breathe
My pulse is racin' like the scene of a crime
So good it can't be legal
So dangerous and lethal
And you know it
Good love's so hard to find now
So, opеn up your mind now
I'm about to blow it
Just look at these chains
I'm tied up and insanе
(Unbreakable, unshakeable
Unbreakable, unshakeable)
Just look at these chains
Yes, I'll say it again
It's unmistakably love
You got me bustin' out
These flames of love could set this house on fire
So come on, take a chance
Come on, don't make me dance alone
We can take this higher

Just look at these chains
I'm tied up and insane
(Unbreakable, unshakeable
Unbreakable, unshakeable)
Just look at these chains
Yes, I'll say it again
It's unmistakably love
Just look at these chains
I'm tied up and insane
(Unbreakable, unshakeable
Unbreakable, unshakeable)
Just look at these chains
Yes, I'll say it again
Oh, no, no, no, no
Just look at these chains
I try to break them in vain
Unbreakable, unshakeable
Unbreakable, unshakeable
Just look at these chains
Let me say it again
It's unmistakably love

4 ContributorsLifeless LyricsI couldn't breathe
As I watched you leave
I thought we had something
But I wanted more
I played my cards
But I pushed you too hard
I feel like a shipwreck
Washed up on your shore
Something's happening
That I couldn't see
I can't get my head around
What you did to me
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone
You left me out on my own
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
You let me take it alone
You left mе down on my knees
You let me go (You let mе)
You left me lifeless
I can't let go
It's body and soul
I'm drowning in memories
So just throw me a line
I feel betrayed
And my nerves are all frayed
Like the last rose of summer
As it dies on the vine

Something's happening
But I didn't know
I can't turn the time back
And it's starting to show
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone (Cold as a stone)
You left me out on my own
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
You let me take it alone (Take it alone)
You left me down on my knees
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
I just can't believe
A word they said
I've got these voices in my head
And they won't leave me alone
So come on now, come in
From the cold
Don't leave me lifeless
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone (Cold as a stone)
You left me out on my own
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
You let me take it alone (Take it alone)
You left me down on my knees
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
You left me cold as a stone (Cold as a stone)
You left me out on my own
You let me go (You let me)
You left me lifeless
You let me take it alone (Take it alone)
You left me down on my knees
You let me go (You let me, you let me)
You left me lifeless

When the night time unfolds and the memories that you hold
Bring a light to your eyes though you know it's disguise
When the night turns to day you turn around and say
Magic mirror please tell is this heaven or hell?

Answer to the master

Can you look to the sky? Can you live through your lie?
Of the thoughts you can't trace which time can't erase
To a face on the wall do you often recall
What you said on the night when the new full moon was rising?

You're ready to hit the streets
Winking at the boys, yeah, heading for the noise
Got the world at your feet
If leaving me for dead with a pistol at my head
Is your idea of how I'd feel
Well let me tell you honey before you spend all of your money
I got my hands firmly on the wheel, yeah

It's way past midnight and you travel through the city
You wonder what you should do
Well baby can't you see that you've had enough of me
And I've certainly had enough of you

Can you reach out for the glory?
Can you feel the nearness of my hand?

If you look a little harder
You can see we're really all the same
And if you look a little deeper
Can't you see it's really all a game?

It could be anyone
It could be you, it could be me

3 ContributorsBlind Faith LyricsIs it really all a matter of trust
Is it really all a matter of time
Can I read the truth between the lines
Or is this just enough to believe
Can you show me why I need to forgive
Can you tell me I have a reason to live
Are your words enough to heal my wounds
Or are they just enough to deceive
Maybe we need tomorrow
Whatever I need I'll borrow
Wherever you lead I'll follow
I'll follow you down
Did I say enough for dreams to survive
Is my faith enough to keep them alive
Did I pray enough and did you hear
Or were they just enough to get by
Maybe we need tomorrow
Whatever I need I'll borrow
Wherever you lead I'll follow
I'll follow you down
Will you show me where the love begins
Will you wash away all of my sins
Will you say the words i need to hear
They just might be enough to believe

Maybe we need tomorrow
Whatever I need I'll borrow
Wherever you lead I'll follow
I'll follow you down
It doesn't come around here no more
But still you've come to believe
Is it really all a matter of trust
Is it really all a matter of time

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, set your sights on the satellite

Me and you, rendezvous, we've got to take the chance
I'm paralyzed, I'm hypnotized, I'm in some kinda trance
Hazy, crazy, this thing's lost control
It's got the power, it's got the strength to steal away your soul

Sometimes it ain't what it seems
I'm all in a daze
Can't find my way out of this maze
I'm looking for clues
And wanting a change in the rules
I'm locked in a cage
Acting out on the wrong stage
Don't want your sympathy, no no no
Don't need the third degree, no no no
Just got to break away and scream
I'm caught in a dream
I'm stood at the edge and I'm looking down
Caught in the danger zone
I feel like a king that has lost his crown
And now I stand here alone
Don't want your sympathy, no
Don't need the third degree, no
Just got to break away and scream
I'm caught in a dream
Fractured love, fractured love
Iron fist in a velvet glove
Fractured Love, fractured love
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love

I don't care if you pull down the sky
Angry passion is a friend of mine

But there ain't much use
Got some walkin' from a bad reaction

Now my brain and my body are runnin' on different rails
And the guy that just said "hi" was as hard as nails, oh

Lyin' half-dead on the floor

What happened the night before

With just me and my wine, oh

And dousing the flames

But I wake to trip the day
Never for you never for me
Would I kiss your feet of clay
I'm still alive and so should I
Soak up the wave of compromise
Am I the victim of youth
Is this the truthh
Why don't you tell me
Why don't you tell me
There's no conscience
In charity or shame
The voice deceive me
But believe me its the same
I see the black in white
And the color in the gray
Better for me better for you
Going to bleach it all away
I'm still alive and so should I
Soak up the wave of compromise
I see the scars, I hear the lies
So what's the truth
Why don't you tell me

Well, we were getting ready just the other night
When a knock on the dressing room door
Gave way to a leather jacket little girl
Who we'd never ever seen before
In her red satin dress and her high heeled shoes
She took us all by surprise
And when she asked us what we wanted to do
Well, she said it with her eyes

Just get your rocks off

When we finally took the stage there she was
But she wasn't on her own
Because she'd brought some friends maybe 5 or 6
Yeah, she must have been on the phone
And when they started dancing and jumping around
Well we couldn't believe our eyes
Because they'd got the whole damn audience rocking
And they'd got us paralyzed

Just get your rocks off

And there was everything we'd need
We were gonna live forever

We were right and we were wrong
Dancing to a different song every day
We were gonna live forever
Is this our last chance?
Is this our last try?
Is this our last dance
Before we turn around
And say goodbye?
Do you remember when we used to dance?

[Song 119: Kings of the World]
3 ContributorsKings of the World LyricsWe were born to rule
Masters of all the universe
For we are the kings of the world
I've played the fool
Broke every rule
Through thick and thin
I've played to win
Against the odds
I fought the gods
And right or wrong
I still stand strong
I count the cost
Of what is lost
When you're under attack
If you never look back
I've been knocked to the floor
But I've come back for more
We were born to rule the earth
Defenders of the universe
Keepers of the flame forevermore
We will fight for what is worth
Cause we were born to rule the earth
Victory is ours to taste
Protectors of the human race
We're the kings of the world

I've felt brave
To play the game
But I stood tall
And gave it all
I count the cost
Of what is lost
When you're under attack
If you never look back
I've been knocked to the floor
But I've come back for more
We were born to rule the earth
Defenders of the universe
Keepers of the flame forevermore
We will fight for what is worth
Cause we were born to rule the earth
Victory is ours to taste
Protectors of the human race
We're the kings of the world
Greater than the seven seas
Mightier than Hercules
We will battle till the fight is won
Our time will come
Again and again and again and again

We were born to rule the earth
Defenders of the universe
Keepers of the flame forevermore
We will fight for what is worth
Cause we were born to rule the earth
Victory is ours to taste
Protectors of the human race
We're the kings of the world
We're the kings of the world
We're the kings of the world
We're the kings of the world

3 ContributorsLet Me Be the One Lyrics
Something in the way you move
Lets me get too close to you
I tremble when I look at your face
And I want all the world to see
Tonight the world belongs to me
Touch me with your animal grace

Put your hand on my heart
And the feel the need in me
Let me be the one
Lead me into temptation
And show me the right side of wrong
Let me be the one
Take me in from the cold
Give me something to hold
Let me be the one
Let me be the one

Burning in the afterglow
Catch the wind and let it go
Washed away like words in the sand
A passion that's so physical, electric and untouchable
Don't want to let it slip through my hands


Don't let this dream pass by
Just spread your wings and fly
Reach out and touch
Let your heart just bring me in
I'll be your oxygen

Left out in this Hollywood Babylon
Was unbelievable, unbelievable

So let my greatest fear walk out the door, ahh
This ain't what we're fighting for, ahh

You don't say that it's over, over
Never thought this could die
But you speak without words
Making me feel so damn good, 'bye
It's unbelievable

Girl, I picture how the ghost of you
Would follow me everywhere
It's undeniable, unbelievable
If I couldn't feel your velvet lips
Your fingers run through my hair
It's inconceivable, unbelievable



Did you really think about it
What we could be missing
I found it so hard to believe, yeah
Unbelievable, it's unbelievable, yeah

2 ContributorsRide Into The Sun (Original Lyrics) LyricsI'm revvin' my engine doing hundred and four
I got the throttle open, she won't take no more
Cause I'm riding, riding into the sun
We're shooting down the highway got my baby behind
She holds on to my hips and drives me out of my mind
Cause we're riding, riding into the sun
We gotta make it, make it by midnight
If we take it, you know that it's alright
And if we break it, no need to get uptight
Just ride, just ride into the sun
Just ride into the sun
We're cruising and we're broozing
And we're having some fun
We're chasing through the country
Got the blues on the run
Cause we're riding, riding into the sun
It's such an easy feeling with the wind in my hair
I'm burning up the rubber and I don't really care
Cause I'm riding, riding into the sun
We gotta make it, make it by midnight
And if we take it, you know that it's alright
And if we break it, no need to get uptight
Just ride, just ride into the sun

And if we take it, you know that it's alright

4 ContributorsInvincible LyricsJust like the movies
When the hero never dies
I am immortal
When you look into my eyes
A lead role in a gilded cage
I could take the centre stage
Bruised hearts are broken
When love is at the door
I bet your tears dried up
Before they hit the floor
I'm gonna take a guilt trop
But I promise be back soon
You wake up screaming
When I leave the room
I am invincible
'Cos my love is here to stay
I am invincible
And I will chase the ghosts away
When you need a light in the darkest night
Just hear what I say
I am invincible I'm not invisible
I am invincible
You keep on moving
Running from your perfect past
Hiding in your broken dreams
Was never gonna last
A love looking for a sign
A shiver looking for a spine
Never let that feeling slip away

I am invincible
'Cos my love is here to stay
I am invincible
And I will chase the ghosts away
When you need a light in the darkest night
Just hear what I say
I am invincible I'm not invisible
I am invincible
I am invincible
'Cos my love is here to stay
I am invincible
And I will chase the ghosts away
When you need a light in the darkest night
Just hear what I say
I am invincible I'm not invisible

Ain't just your kiss, K I S S that I miss
Ain't just the way that you squeeze me tight
If there's a wish at the top of my list
Uh, is that you be there every day and every night

I found a new four letter word
The sweetest sound that I ever heard
I found a new four letter word
Lust can kinda be nice
But it ain't L O V E, indeed
All right

Oh when the rush that I'm dreaming of's not enough
You touch and I can't control myself
You put the glide back into my stride
Oh yeah, you move me like nobody else

I found a new four letter word
The sweetest sound that I ever heard
I found a new four letter word
Lust can kinda be nice
But it ain't L O V E, oh yeah
Let me spell it out, c'mon

You're all I'm looking for
You ain't the girl next door
You're really so much more
You put me to shame
And then you walk right in
You know I can't explain
You do that loving thing
All over again
Live life just like a wild ride
More like a landslide
Take me away

New four letter word
The sweetest sound that I ever heard
I found a new four letter word
The sweetest sound that I ever heard
New four letter word
And baby, the sweetest sound that I ever heard
New four letter word

3 ContributorsPearl of Euphoria Lyrics
Your price, name the time
The suspect or the crime
The shadow of my gun
Get down or you can run
Feed the demon, kiss the flame, feel your desire
Empty room, turn the key
You're never alone when you're with me
Temptation, break the vow
Cut flesh from the sacred cow

Unchain the tiger, kiss the flame, feel your desire
Feed the demon, kiss the flame, feel your desire

Soaked in fear, the curtain falls
Religion within these walls
Mystify my soul beliefs
Confession is my release


Pearl of euphoria, pearl of euphoria

[Song 127: Getcha Rocks Off]
5 ContributorsGetcha Rocks Off LyricsWell, we were gettin' ready just the other night
When a knock on the dressing room door
Gave way to a leather jacket little girl
Who we'd never ever seen before
In her red satin dress and her high heeled shoes
She took us all by surprise
And when she asked us what we wanted to do
Well, she said it with her eyes
Just getcha rocks off, woo
Well, when we finally took the stage, there she was
But she wasn't on her own
'Cause she'd brought some friends, maybe five or six
Yeah, she must have been on the phone
And when they started dancing and jumping around
Well, we couldn't believe our eyes
'Cause they'd got the whole damn audience rockin'
And they'd got us paralyzed
Just getcha rocks off
Thank you, good night, woo!

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, now
Stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me


So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Woah, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

Oh, stand by me

[Song 129: 10 X Bigger Than Love]
3 Contributors10 X Bigger Than Love LyricsI lost my heart to infatuation
You can't cure that with a vaccination
Bad blood is pumping through my veins
I can't slow down livin' life in the fast lane
Your body language, it's telepathic
I'm caught up in the middle of a two-way traffic
Wondering if this is the impossible dream
Or whether we could make such a beautiful team
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than love
Intoxicated 'till I can't feel a thing
I feed my thirst on your unchained adrenaline
Your body's shakin' like a man on the run
You blow my mind like sex and machine guns
I got scars and bloody knucklesd
Diggin' for a diamond in a whole lotta trouble
You detonate me like a nuclear bomb
Wiped out and sleepin' with the TV on
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than.....

Love is love, it ain't always right
Make you sweat, keep you up all night
Walkin' in with your eyes wide open
You're looking out on a lost horizon
Always something to knock you over
And make you feel like you're getting nowhere
If you can't stand up when you're on your knees
Then close your eyes and float up to the breeze
I've lost my heart but hey you can keep it
Cause it ain't no good at keeping a secret
It's got me doing things that I'd never do
Another fine mess that it's gotten me in to
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is, I don't know what it is
I don't know what to do when I get this feeling
I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin'
A little white lie that you got to believe in
Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than love

Saturday night and I crashed your car
Sunday night when you threw me out
Couldn't believe I even got that far
Look out of your bedroom window
And tell me what you see
Who's that standing in the shadows
Oh baby you belong to me, yeah
Place your bets cause I got a good feeling
Hey over there, are you lookin' my way
Electrified like a shock to the system
You walk right through my DNA
If you could just walk for a mile in my shoes
If you don't lose your mind you got no mind to lose
Bang bang gonna shoot you down
I got me a gun but I gotta get a better one
Sweatin' hard, buzzing like a fly
Like a, like a thief with a water-tight alibi
High hopes are sinking like a stone
I swallow my pride but I'm choking on a fishbone
Oh my, I gotta try, so step right up

I'll give you what you want
It's what you need
You know I'm gonna give you what you want
And what you need, yeah
Head over heels and it's making me nervous
Get on my knees and it's making me worse
There's no way out so I pay lip-service
If this thing is bigger than the both of us
If you could just walk for a mile in my shoes
If you don't lose your mind you got no mind to lose
Bang bang gonna shoot you down
I got me a gun but I gotta get a better one
Sweatin' heart, buzzing like a fly
Like a, like a thief with a water-tight alibi
High hopes are sinking like a stone
I swallow my pride but I'm choking on a fishbone
Oh my, I gotta try, so step right up
I'll give you what you want
It's what you need
You know I'm gonna give you what you want
And what you need, yeah

[Song 131: Guilty]
2 ContributorsGuilty Lyrics
Guilty as sin, yes I confess
I can't deny
Strong in the heart, weak in the flesh
I never meant to do you wrong

I swear the soul gets blistered along the way
But when you hurt the things you love
You got to know
If you mean hope, if you mean fear
Of those words that you've been longing to hear
If you mean faith, if you mean love
Then I'm guilty, I'm guilty of all the above

Can't hide the truth, I stand accused
Don't ask me why
I question every move and thought I had
That's going on inside

I swear the soul gets blistered along the way
But when you hurt the things you love
You got to know
If you mean hope, if you mean fear
All those words that you've been longing to hear
If you mean faith, if you mean love
Then I'm guilty
And if it's wrong to feel this right
I can't help it and I won't fight
If you mean faith, if you mean love
Then I'm guilty, I'm guilty of all the above

It's not my first offence
And it won't be the last (My lips are sealed)
I would not change a thing
Except what's in the past

If you mean hope, if you mean fear
All those words that you've been longing to hear
If you mean faith, if you mean love
Then I'm guilty of loving you
If you mean hope (guilty), if you mean fear
(Never said I was innocent)
Wrap your arms around me
If you mean, if you mean love
(And it's you that I want)
And I won't fight
And if it's wrong, it feels right
Guilty, guilty

[Song 133: Winter Song]
3 ContributorsWinter Song LyricsWhen winter's shadowy fingers
First pursue you down the street
And your boots no longer lie
About the cold around your feet
Do you spare a thought for summer whose passage is complete?
Whose memories lie in ruins
And whose ruins lie in heat ?
When winter...
Comes howling in
When the wind is singing strangely
Blowing music through your head
And your rain splattered windows
Make you decide to stay in bed
Do you spare a thought for the homeless tramp who wishes he was dead?
Or do you pull the bed-clothes higher
Dream of summertime instead?
When winter...
Comes howling in
The creeping cold has fingers
That caress without permission
And mystic crystal snowdrops
Only aggravate the condition
Do you spare one thought for the gypsy with no secure position?
Who's turned and spurned by village and town
At the magistrate's decision?
When winter...
Comes howling in

When the turkey's in the oven
And the Christmas presents are bought
And Santa's in his module
He's an American astronaut
Do you spare one thought for Jesus, who had nothing but his thoughts?
Who got busted just for talking
And befriending the wrong sorts?
When winter...
Comes howling in
When winter...
Comes...
Howling...
In

Twenty-four hours of every day
I'd walk on glass just to hear you say
Getting it on is like a drug to me
I want you baby, can't you see
I'm crashed and I'm crushed and I'm stuck on you
I'd do anything that you want me to
I'd crawl on my knees just to get to you
I close my eyes and girl it's true

On a psychedelic space machine, galactic sugar high
Like a caffeinated satellite gone way past 99
Come on, be my
21st century girl, all outrageous, quite contagious
21st century, you got solar fire
21st century girl, sweet romancer, cosmic dancer
21st century sha la la la girl

Kiss this, you're blowing my mind
Never say never, but I'm taking my time
Girl to the world from the A to the Z
I fall for you so easily
Catch my breath because I know too well
That I just can't control myself
Realize we synchronize
It's only when I close my eyes


Flying, flying
You take me up, you set me free
No time to breathe, just zero G
High, still flying, no gravity
She's flying


21st century, sha la la la girl
She's a 21st century, sha la la la girl
21st century, sha la la la girl
She's a 21st century sha la la la girl

2 ContributorsGo Lyrics
This is a truth adjust
Has to be told, it must
We spread amongst us so the world can hear it
We got to get it right
This time, if we just fight
Innocence starts tonight
If we can heal it

We look to our leaders
With the lies they try to feed us
Like a knife they try to bleed us
And they cut us real slow

So go
Just go
Just go
You hide behind your mask of desperation
Go
Just go
Just go
I won't surrender to the last temptation

You have no dignity
I have no sympathy
You are my enemy
But i can't see you
No matter where you run
Thy kingdom will be done
A rocket to the sun
Is where I see you
Endless senses get ecstatic
Overflow is automatic
Feel the need to feel erratic
Don't deny it let it flow

So go
Just go
Just go
You hide behind your mask of desperation
Go
Just go
Just go
I won't surrender to this fake salvation

You know me, just look in my eyes
I shed my skin, got a new disguise
My heart still beats and I'm still the same
Do you know my name
It's everything you've ever seen
It's every dream you've broken
It's only when you keep your eyes wide open

Like a circle of light spinning out of control
And I just can't let go

Day after day there's a voice deep inside me
Day after day there's the ghost of a lie
Every belief that has come back to find me
Day after day and it follows me blindly
Day after day

I feel you, you're under my skin
You look in the mirror, you know where I've been
My heart still beats but it's not the same
Don't you know my name
I'm always there to keep your eyes wide open





Day after day

I don't want tp fall in love
But it's been taken out of my hands
And right now I realize
I don't want to say goodbye
I miss you more than words can say
They never turn out right, but here goes anyway

Everyday I miss your touch
Never thought it would mean so much
All the words I could've said got me reeling torn to shreds
Every road I go is nowhere
But I know you're out there somewhere
These voices in my head got me feeling torn to shreds

I can't help the way I feel
That something's got a hold of my heart
It hurts but I can't let go
Yeah, I just want to let you know
I need you more than words can say
They never turn out right, but here goes anyway


If I ever get myself together
And it takes whatever it takes
To get myself back to you

2 ContributorsEveryday Lyrics
I gave in when you gave out
You showed me the way to love, there ain't no doubt
Always together and never apart
Disappeared, didn't say a word
I slept right through, guess I never heard
Now I'm awake but I wish I was dreaming

Everyday, without you in my heart
Everyday, I'm falling apart
And I know you know I think about you everyday

I woke up and you were gone
Just one night without you, it's too long
Sleeping with the ghost of you
Dying with or without you
Don't want to feel this way tomorrow


Don't know what you got until it's gone

Everyday, everyday, without you in my heart
Everyday, I'm falling apart
And I know you know I think about you
Everyday, until I see you again
Everyday, I'll try to pretend
But I know you know I think about you
Everyday, out of my head, I've been dazed and confused
Everyday, I'm lost but it's you that I don't want to lose
Everyday, we're torn to giving ourselves to each other

Hey! Hey! Hey!

I'm back in your face like I've never been away
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm going to stay
Like a runaway mack, like a a union jack
I'm back
Hey! Hey!

I can stand tall, I can stick out a mile
I can come crawling like a hungry reptile

I'm coming around, I'm wired for sound
Shaking it for all it's worth
I'm a spaced-out alien, a techno-sapien
Crashing on down to earth


I can pour your drink, be the perfect host
I can scare the pants off the holiest ghost



Back in the middle, back in the ring
Backing a winner, it's a sure shot thing
Back in your good books, I did you no wrong
Here I am honey, I'm back where I belong
Belong, belong, belong

I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yeah I'm back
You better believe that I'm back
Now let me tell you I'm back
Can't you see that I'm back
Come on and do it, I'm back
There's nothing to it, I'm back

I'm back in your face like I've never been away
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm going to stay
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack
I'm back in your face and don't it feel so good
I'm back in your face and just like I knew that it would
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack
Sheer heart attack and a Jumping jack flash
Like a leader of the pack
And as a matter of fact I'm back

So do me a favour
Won't you
Move with me slowly
Get too close to me
Move with me slowly
Just like we're meant to be
Just like we're meant to be
Hey say sister
You're dreaming
You got stars in your eyes
A little conscious behavior
Is gonna cut
You down to size
You hear me knocking
So let me in
When your blood runs cold
And your love wears thin
It's over passion
It's under the skin
If love ain't a miracle
It sure ain't a sin
So let me in

Take me to the city
Take me on my knees
Take me anyway
You find me baby
I've got this love disease
And there ain't nothin'
I can do

[Song 141: It’s Only Love]
2 ContributorsIt’s Only Love Lyrics
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

If you could feel what I feel
If I could make you see
If you could need like I need
I'd be the air that you breathe

You go straight to my head as I lie in my bed
I just can't win
I can't help the state I'm in
It's only love so why is falling in it
The one thing that you can't do
It's only love then why am I hurting from it
It's only love if you're hurting too

Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

If you could share my wildest thoughts
Meet me in my mind
If you could want the way that I want
You'd want me all the time


Every dream I dream has got you in
And every minute with you means everything
I wanna take you there where you've never been
In my dreams


Na na na na na na na na na
It's only love if you're hurting too
Na na na na na na na na na
It's only love if you're hurting too

[Song 142: Two Steps Behind (electric version) / Miss You in a Heartbeat (unplugged)]
2 ContributorsTwo Steps Behind (electric version) / Miss You in a Heartbeat (unplugged) LyricsWalk away if you want to
It's okay if you need to
You can run but you can never hide
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you
There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all
(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yeah, yeah
Take the time to think about it
Just walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around and see what you can find
Like the fire that's burning up inside me
Now there's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all
No
(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yeah, yeah
Ohh

Ohh
There's a magic running through your soul
But you, you can't have it all
(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yeah, baby
Two steps behind
Ohh, sugar
Two steps behind

Look in these eyes

And they say that if you don't blink
Then you don't die

And if you ever gonna doubt my faith

[Song 144: Only the Good Die Young]
4 ContributorsOnly the Good Die Young Lyrics
I saw you on a screen
An icon, a legend, a king
I heard it in a song
That's still going strong

A shooting star across the sky
You kiss the earth and say goodbye

Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Crashing into the sun
Only the good die young
They will always be here

I saw you in a dream
You're falling apart at the seams
I heard it in your voice
That you had no choice
This genius is a heavy load
It leads you down a lonely road
But love never dies


Living inside out
Oh turn this chariot
Like a diamond in the sky
You take me so far away


Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Crashing into the sun
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Only the good die young 

[Song 145: Gift of Flesh]
3 ContributorsGift of Flesh Lyrics
I am all destiny
A trade, a grain of sand
I am the lesson to be learned
I take the throat of innocence
And leave decay
I stain the way for all to see

No fear, no voice, no reason
In God no guiding light

When all the guilt that's in your head
Turns it's back and plays the dead
You scorch the earth and torch the sky
Conscience low with head held high

Indulge and multiply
And sacrifice
As lack of breath chokes underground
Divulge degenerate
The darker side
From windows watch the screaming sky



From all the truth comes all the shame
The curse of flesh just takes it's aim
On hollowed ground and tortured sky
Walk in fear with spirits high

[Song 146: Sea of Love]
4 ContributorsSea of Love LyricsBow to the man who gets to
Give with what he can
Kneel to the universal mother
Say a prayer for that child
Where no one cares
Give a hand to help your brother
We got need for the greedy
And greed for the needy
We eat to feed on one another
Warmth for the chosen
Only fear the frozen
Sincerity lives undercover
Set adrift on the sea of love
Ride on the breeze with only heaven above
You'll be sailing the sea of love
Open your mind be careful what you find
Hail to the love with only
Love to discover
A broken heart for consolation
Bread for the winner
Others starve for their dinner
The noble cause is in vain

Set adrift on the sea of love
Ride on the breeze with only heaven above
You'll be sailing the sea of love
Open your mind be careful what you find
Try breaking while your hearts not beating
Try bleeding when you start to feel
Try crawling while the sky is falling
Try walking while you're standing still
Set adrift on the sea of love
Ride on the breeze with only heaven above
You'll be sailing the sea of love
Unlock your mind and let your true love shine
Set adrift on the sea of love
Ride on the breeze with only heaven above
You'll be sailing the sea of love
Keep yourself alive take your mission to survive
Open your mind believe in what you find

[Song 147: Bad Actress]
3 ContributorsBad Actress Lyrics
Twenty-one years and you answer the call
Hollywood screams from your bedroom wall
You can't get away from the thrill of it all

Bye-bye baby
Get me out of here I'm done
A girl gone crazy
You ain't fooling anyone
You can't sing can't dance
Can't fit in your pants
You're a bad actress
You can't run, can't walk, got to learn how to talk
You're a bad actress

Come on down and walk the moonlit mile
You've got the perfect teeth
You've got the perfect smile
You do it all wrong but you do it in style
Oh yeah


You can't read, can't write
Got to learn how to fight
You're a bad actress
You're too cold, too old
And the story's been told about
The bad actress


You can't run, can't walk
Got to learn how to talk
You're a bad actress
You can't read, can't write
Got to learn how to fight
You're a bad actress
You're too cold, too old
And the story's been told about
The the bad actress

Oh Yeah
Bad actress
Oooh
Bad actress
No good
Bad actress
Too bad
What's a girl like you doing in a nice place like this?

[Song 148: All Time High]
4 ContributorsAll Time High LyricsYou ask me to be your savior
But I'm the poster boy for bad behavior
I'm on the edge it's a long way down
Living out loud at the speed of sound
I can hear you calling out my name
You tell me that fate is calling
'cos all you see is darkness falling
Don't let go don't lose your grip
Fire and ice at your fingertips
Can't you hear me calling out for more?
You knock me out like a wrecking crew
I'm back on my feet and all over you
Faster than I've ever been before
I'm on an all time high
Never giving up never giving up
Never gonna die
I'm on an all time high
You gimme the wings
You gimme the reason to fly
Shine your light and I will find you
Follow me I'm right behind you
This is the lifeblood on which I feed
Take what you want I got all I need
There ain't no mountain I can't climb

I once was knee deep in the mud
Lifeless and waiting for the flood
But now my heart is bursting at the seams
And I will not go quietly
No I will not go quietly

[Song 149: Little Wing]
3 ContributorsLittle Wing LyricsWell she's walking through the clouds
With a circus smile that's running round
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
She's riding with the wind
When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright, she says, it's alright
Take anything you want from me, anything
Anything, yeah
Well she's walking through the clouds
With a circus smile that's running round
Oh, butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
She's riding with the wind, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah little wing

3 ContributorsOnly After Dark LyricsAhh
I feel my spirit fly, only after dark
Ahh, Ahhh
I, I kiss the world good-bye, only after dark
Ahh, Ahhh
Night, with the city lights, only after dark
Ahh, Ahhh
Run like a runaway, only after dark
Ahh, Ahhh
Won't you disappear
Into midnight again
Why don't you come
Why won't you come
Why don't you fly fly fly with me
Sweet innocent fate will be our company
Ahh, Ahhh, Ahh, Ahhh
We at the plant remain, only after dark
Ahh, Ahhh
Moon, simple as can be, only after dark
Ahh, Ahhh
It's wrong to feel so free, only after dark
Ahh, Ahhh
Only you do it to me, only after dark

Won't you disappear
Into midnight again
