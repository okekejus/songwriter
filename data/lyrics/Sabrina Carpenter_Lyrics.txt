I know I have good judgment, I know I have good taste
It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
But just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby

Please, please, please
Don't prove I'm right
And please, pleasе, please
Don't bring me to tеars when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)

Well, I have a fun idea, babe (Uh-huh), maybe just stay inside
I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice (It's so nice, right?)
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really (Kinda), really, really

Please, please, please (Please don't prove I'm right)
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice

I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh

Don't do it in front of me

We had sex, I met your best friends
Then a bird flies by and you forget

'Til your guilt creeps in
On a Tuesday, send a soft "hey"
As if you really don't recall the time

We were goin' right, then you took a left

Guess I'll waste another year on wonderin' if

You're confused and I'm upsеt, but

All the silence just makes it worse, really
'Cause it leaves you so top-of-mind for me
All the silence is just your strategy
'Cause it leaves you so top-of-mind for me

We never talk about how you
Found God at your ex's house, always
Made sure that the phone was face-down
Seems like overnight, I'm just the bitch you hate now
We never talk it through

You're so dumb and poetic
It's just what I fall for, I like the aesthetic
Every self-help book, you've already read it
Cherry-pick lines like they're words you invented
Gold star for highbrow manipulation
And "love everyone" is your favorite quotation
Try to come off like you're soft and well-spoken
Jack off to lyrics by Leonard Cohen

Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you talk like one doesn't make you a man

You're so sad there's no communication
But, baby, you put us in this situation
You're running so fast from the hearts that you're breakin'
Save all your breath for your floor meditation
You're so empathetic, you'd make a great wife
And I promise the mushrooms aren't changing your life
Well, you crashed the car and abandoned the wreckage
Fuck with my head like it's some kind of fetish

Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you act like one doesn't make you a man
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you leave like one doesn't make you a man

This week, you're holdin' space for her tongue in your mouth
Now shе's sendin' you some pictures wеarin' less and less
Tryna turn the past into the present tense, huh
Suckin' up to all of your mutual friends

And you've lost all your common sense (You've lost all your common sense)

Your car drove itself from L.A. to her thighs
Palm Springs looks nice, but who's by your side?
Damn it, she looks kinda like the girl you outgrew
Least that's what you said (That's what you said)

Oh  wow, you just broke up again

Oh, it's like that, I'm your dream come true
When it's on a platter for you
Then you pull back when I try to make plans
More than two hours in advance, mm

I slam the door, I hit ignore

Don't smile because it happened, baby
Cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her

My heart is heavy now, it's like a hundred pounds
It's fallin' faster than the way you love to shut me down
I think I need a shower, my friends are takin' shots
You think it's happy hour, for me, it's not

Don't smile because it happened, baby
Cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her
Don't smile becausе it happened, baby
Cry becausе it's over
(I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me)
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her
(I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me)

Pour my feelings in the microphone
I stay in, and when the girls come home
I want one of them to take my phone
Take my phone and lose your
Number, I don't wanna be tempted
Pick up when you wanna fall back in
You can fake it, but you know I know
Know I know

Don't smile because it happened, baby (Don't, oh)

To something that looks better
I'm stupid, but I'm clever
Yeah, I can make a shitshow look a whole lot like forever and ever

You showed up with a boombox and stars in your eyes
Who knew cuddling on trampolines could be so reckless?

Fell so deeply into it
It was all so innocent

Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked
I'm the hot topic on your tongue
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy

Ah, mmm

I'm not catastrophizing, everything's derailing
Was only tryna hold you close while your heart was failing
It's not internet illusion, just two kids going through it
You said I'm too late to be your first love, but I'll always be your favorite

Meeting you as the glass-half-full version of me

Would've folded, but I can't now
Heard they say this emotion should be kind

But I couldn't make it

Your arms are reachin'
And your eager heart is throbbing
I know you're frustrated
'Cause I will not let you touch me
You say you can take it
But you don't know how hard I can make it

Fuckboys you'll never meet
Well, you can thank them for why I'm so goddamn reactionary
And for the graveyard in my stomach
Filled with pivotal formative comments
Meanwhile, you're just tryna tell me I look nice (Ooh)

Read their texts like they're havin' sex right now
Scared I'll find out that it's true
And if I do, then I blame you
For every worst that I assume
When I'm forty-five, someone calls me their wife
And he fucks our lives in one selfish night
Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did

I'm intentionally careless, least I got self-awareness
Just want someone to love me who doesn't

Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin' (When we're kissin')
And when you're comin' down the chimney
Oh, it feels so good
I need that Charles Dickens (No)
You'll be Santa Claus and I'll be Mrs. (Mrs., uh)
I'll take you for a ride, I'll be your Vixen
I don't even know, I'm talkin' Christmas (Oh-oh-oh)

Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a Christ-smash
How quickly can you build a snowman? Think fast

73 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolbosanskiPortuguêsFrançaisItalianoSabrina Carpenter - skinny dipping (Nederlandse Vertaling)skinny dipping Lyrics
It'll be a Wednesday
And I'll be goin' to this coffee shop
Hear the barista call an oat milk latte and your name
And I look up from my phone
And think there's no chance it's you, but it is
You'll say, "Hi," I'll say, "Hi, how are you?"
You'll say, "How's your family? How's your sister?"
I'll say, "Shannon's bein' Shannon"
After a minute of nonsensical chatter, you'll say
"Well, this was really nice, maybe we should do this on purpose sometime"
And it'll have been long enough that we won't harp on (Hmm)

Arguments in your garage
All the ways we sabotaged it (Mmm)
What it was and what it wasn't

We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff
I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship
It'd bе so nice, right? Right?
If we could take it all off and just еxist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge

You'll suggest a restaurant we used to go to
And I'll say, "Won't that be too nostalgic?"
And you'll say, "Maybe, but let's do it anyway
We won't sit at our same old table, I promise
And we won't bring up the past, we'll keep it bureaucratic"
And we won't say it, but both of us, we'll be thinkin' about
How different we are from those scared little kids that had those (Hmm)

Arguments in your garage
All the ways we sabotaged it (Mmm)
What it was and what it wasn't

We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff
I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship
It'd be so nice, right? Right?
If we could take it all off and just exist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge

Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha

We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff

One year, ten thousand bad moments
But it was dressed up in heated emotion
And I tried to look for the best in the worst
But like, fuck me, that caused a commotion
You're lucky I'm a private person
I've quietly carried your burden
And everyone thinks you're an angel
But shit, I would probably use different wordin'

Oh, you're so vicious
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Crush my heart and wreck my image
Why you gotta be so vicious?

You like a certain type of woman
Who's smart, but neglects intuition
When you're insecure, could be me, could be her
You just run to whoever is winnin' (Ah)

Said that it was me and you for life
Now you're kinda acting like I died

Oh, you're so vicious
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Crush my heart and wreck my image
Why you gotta be so, so, so
Oh, you're so vicious (No)
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Half of me just can't resist it
Why you gotta be so vicious?

Oh, no
Why you gotta be so
Oh, oh
Why you gotta be so vicious?

You don't feel remorse, you don't feel the effects
'Cause you don't think you hurt me if you wish me the best
I shoulda known all along, I was only the next one
To take your love songs as a promise

Oh, you're so vicious
I loved you, but I wish I didn't
If you're out there somewhere listenin'
Why you gotta be so vicious?

Your eyes crashin' into my eyes
Was I accidentally falling in love?
Your words didn't mean to heal the hurt
We're coincidentally more than enough

All these days, I never thought

But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you

You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it

And my time changin' all of your time
It's a butterfly effect on my heart

We were never in the park
Talkin' on a seesaw teetering with our feelings in the dark
Ignoring tornado warnings
He didn't hold me in his arms
We didn't stumble over the pages of our relationship arc
Ignoring tornado warnings

Don't understand how quickly we get
Right back in our rhythm without missing a step
And logically the last thing I should have on my mind
But I want you there sometimes

I guess maybe that's why I'm lying to my therapist
I keep saying things like, "I never saw him and we never kissed"
Now I think somehow in my mind
If I could convince him, if he doesn't see it, then maybe it doesn't exist
I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch
I'm lying to my therapist

I deserve an hour in a week to focus on my thoughts
Not so obsessed with yours, I can't hear myself speak
I deserve my own consideration, but sometimes, I wish I kept
Some of my feelings in the basement so I'd still have some left

Don't understand how quickly we get
Right back in our rhythm without missing a step
And logically the last thing I should have on my mind
But I want you there sometimes

I guess maybe that's why I'm lying to my therapist
I keep saying things like, "I never saw him and we never kissed"
Now I think somehow in my mind
If I could convince him, if he doesn't see it, then maybe it doesn't exist
I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch
I'm lying to my therapist

I'll drive you home, you drive me crazy
But that's not gonna stop me
I'll call you out, you call me "baby"
But that's not gonna stop me

From lying to my therapist
I keep saying things like, "I never saw him and we never kissed"
Now I think somehow in my mind
If I could convince him, if he doesn't see it, then maybe it doesn't exist
I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch

Mmm, no, hmm

This feeling's so alien
Need to know if you're just a friend
Are you a secret I'm holdin' in?
So leave it on my brain if you feel the same
Lie but I notice it
Don't know the rules but I got to win
The paranoia is sinkin' in
So leave it on my brain if you feel the same

Ooh, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know
No, no, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know

Don't let me leave when I'm standing at your door
Don't make me stop when you're really wanting more
When you're really wanting more
If you show me what you were thinking of
Let me get inside your mind
If you show me love it'll be enough
It'll be a better night

If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night

Alienated them
Right about when our love began
Emotions are moving in
Getting in my space, livin' in my place
When did these games begin?
I'm overthinking my thoughts again
No, we don't break, but we're bound to bend
Getting in my space, livin' in my place

Ooh, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know
No, no, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me, let me know

Don't let me leave when I'm standing at your door
Baby no, don't let me
Don't make me stop when you're really wanting more
'Cause I know you're wanting more
If you show me what you were thinking of
Let me get inside your mind
If you show me love it'll be enough
It'll be a better night

If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
If you love me, let me know
It'll be a better night (Be a better night)

Qui donne envie d'aimer, d'aimer passionnément
Mon cœur est à toi pour toujours
You will always have my heart

The night that your sister said that you got in an accident"
"And God, I, I'm watchin' everything that you do"
"I can't get your songs out of my head or your hair out of my room"

"I saw you met somebody and I'm jealous as hell

Here I am again, the same old situation
Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated?
I should've played it cool, instead, I made a fool
Oh, the things I do

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh, oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Ooh, ooh

I should've shut my mouth, I could've kept it quiet
I might have freaked him out 'cause I was so excited
But I just couldn't wait, I took a leap of faith
Oh, the things I say

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh, oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh, no, no

And I think sometimes
I tend to be my own worst enemy
And maybe someday
I'm gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue
Doing what I do

And just as I'm giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one, it's so intoxicating
And being where I've been, I know that in the end
I'll do it all again

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, love will find me, there ain't no denying
That you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh, oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Mmm

But they don't know me like my baby

We look good in photographs
I like the way you like to laugh
At dirty jokes, I know they'll always land
Used to get to work on time
But now you're takin' up my nights
Never been so glad to be so tired
Ooh, I'm mad for you

He's good for my heart, but he's bad for business
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby

If I'm just writin' happy songs
Will anybody sing along?
You had to go and break into my head
And I would try to fight these feelings
I can't find a single reason
I'd make all the same mistakes again, ah

He's good for my heart, but he's bad for business (He's very bad for business)
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby

(Oh-oh) Our love is running into a burning building
(Oh-oh) Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

Rumors spread like wildfire
I held a strong ground
But I've been burning down
'Cause it's like fire is all I hear about
And we are fading out
Don't wanna turn out the light
But it's like...

I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm, and there goes the night

Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

Secrets in a small town, they always get around
But the flame has been put out
And I am hearing all the small talk
They whisper as I walk
In a house that's boarded up
So good luck

I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm, and there goes the night

(Oh-oh) Our love is running into a burning building
(Oh-oh) Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

Smoke and fire, smoke and fire
Don't you know that if there's smoke, there's fire?
Smoke there's fire, smoke there's fire
Now, now
(Oh-oh) And now it's over

Of running into a burning building

Rumors spread like wildfire
I held a strong ground
But I've been burning down

(Oh-oh) Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

Smoke and fire, smoke and fire
Don't you know that if there's smoke, there's fire?

Tell me I was more than just a decent opportunity
Or will you tell me anything I wanna hear to control how you're perceived?

Why were you somewhere else when you were next to me?
I know you know it keeps me up
Isn't it kind of strange how it all changed when
I wasn't the one they wanted you to love?

My relatives always know what to say to piss me off

Small talk in the kitchen
Dated, dumb traditions
Who sucks competition (Oh)

That I'm at home with nobody to hold
I'm dreamin' 'bout silver and gold (Silver and gold)
That champagne buzz down to my toes (Down to my toes)
Someone, not you, kissin' me, oh yes
Nеw Year's, is it New Year's yеt?

Santa, Santa, boy, you're the worst
It's the 25th, I wish it was the 1st
Couples all around me, damn, it hurts
Wanna push 'em in the fireplace and watch 'em burn
Santa, Santa, why do you hate me?
I'm a gift, look how God made me
Never, never get what's on my list

I don't wanna buy what they're sellin' these days
Sayin' feelin' and fallin' is all a mistake
No, no
And why does everybody look at young hearts fillin' up
Like it's just a matter of time before they break?
No, no

They started sayin', "When you can't hide, run"
"When you can't run, hide"
Started thinkin' love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all stop thinkin' that the world
Stopped spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did a heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meaning it was worth the while?

I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide

Traded out our eyes to light a screen
Traded our holdin' hands to holdin' back everything
No, no
No, no, oh
And words got shorter and quiet got longer
And all the sudden, love started lookin' like a memory
No, no, no

They started sayin', "If you can't hide, run"
"If you can't run, hide"
Started thinkin' love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all stop thinkin' that the world
Stopped spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did a heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meaning it was worth the while?

I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide, no

Mmm, no
No, no, no

They started sayin', "When you can't hide, run"
"When you can't run, hide"
But love don't gotta be a loaded gun
Or a losin' fight
And when did we all stop thinkin' that the world
Stopped spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did a heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meaning it was worth the while?

But I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved

Running down to when I feel alone and the feeling gone, you can touch it a little
Hear me underneath the covers coloring your body, reading Braille
Take you to Bahamas, seeping through the sand
Sucking on the silence, now I'm in your ear
Telling you, baby, to listen, I just

Wanna feel your skin, wanna feel it on mine
Maybe I been on the Internet forgetting how to keep it slow
But no, I need it bitty bad bone Bonnie Clyde, come and get it

Like whoa, stay, let's keep it this way

People askin' what we doin', I don't say a thing, no
Can we keep it to ourselves like if it's all the same?
'Cause if they know what we know
That's when everything's gonna change

Should we tell 'em? Mmm
It might be too much for them, they might get jealous, hey
The way that you're lifting me up, feel like heaven, oh
I know they can see it, I know they can tell it
So we ain't gotta tell 'em (Shh)

And you could be my everything I'm needing

You're not asking for much, but
It just seems like a lot, and
Kinda confused, don't know what to choose
But baby, it's hard for me, I'm not ready for your love
I keep on the go, but
I don't mean to tease ya
You're down on your knees, you're beggin' me please
But darling, it's not the way to get me, baby, no

Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think we could be a thing
And I'd give you everything, love

Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

We can't get the timing
Because I was running
But now I want you and you always knew
So baby, you pull away and make me wait for you
So screw all that love ish
I think that I've had it
The more you turn your back, then I want you back
'Cause this is the last time I play this game
Always the same and I'm through

Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Oops, didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming

Didn't wanna make you think we could be a thing

That's just the way it is

Would you come alive again, 'live again?

Just walk like you're never alone

But where is the love? Where is the love?

Underneath our clothes, pretend that we know it all
Shut off the lights just to hide in the dark

Think that I know you the farther you are

Even if I know that I will end up in a mess

Like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need

See right through the fiction and all of this fakery

We are young, we are gold
Trying things we didn't know
Looking at the sky
See it come alive
All our fears became our hopes
Climbed out every locked window
We rode a lion's mane
And fell upon the rain

We can reach the constellations
Trust me, all our dreams are breaking out

No, we're never gonna turn to dust
Yeah, all we really need is us
Don't be scared to close your eyes
No, we're never gonna die
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close our eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars

(Oh)
We'll be the stars
(Oh)
We'll be the stars

Let me in, hold me close
Fill my heart with simple notes
So when it's hard to see
They are there reminding me
Take my breath and hold me high
So I can feel the city lights
Glowing under me
It's in our reach, we're breaking out

No, we're never gonna turn to dust
Yeah, all we really need is us
Don't be scared to close your eyes
No, we're never gonna die
We'll be the stars, oh

[Song 78: No Words]
24 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolsrpskiPortuguêsNo Words Lyrics
No words, no words, no words

When everything is quiet
Nothing on the tip of your tongue
But a beautiful silence
And it lets me know
That even in the madness
When everything just seems to go wrong
Take a beautiful silence
'Cause it lets me know

Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars

When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
(No, no, no words)
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
(No, no, no words)

When I'm in the darkness
The dawn is having you by my side
'Cause you leave me speechless
And it lets me know
Where nobody can hear us
I'll tell you everything with my eyes
'Cause you leave me speechless
And I think you know

When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
(No, no, no words)
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
(No, no, no words)

No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words
(No words, no)

No, no, no
No words
No, no

When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
(No, no, no words)
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue (Tip of your tongue)
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
(No, no, no words)

No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words

But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't

We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love

I had the upper hand
But I, I, I
I had the upper hand

O-oh

Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low

How's it going over there in your own universe?
Do you like the colors that you're painting in your world?
Is it easier to stay inside and not get hurt?
Is the weather kind of dreary there without your girl?

Always talking to yourself, are you still happy?
Is it heaven, is it hell, in there without me?
You've got your space and dust
But don't you still need love?

If no one's there
To hear you scream
You can still reach out
Your hand to me
And I'm floating there
I'll always be
The brightest star in your galaxy

[Song 92: Your Love’s Like]
21 ContributorsTranslationssrpskiYour Love’s Like Lyrics
Woah-oh, woah-oh

Sometimes life gets bitter
I get strung out, caught in the middle
And I can't breathe
I just need a little taste of paradise
I know a place I can escape to
Where I go, troubles never break through
The grass is greener, my head is clearer
I got peace of mind

When I fall into your eyes

Your love's like breathing in the salty air of summer
On a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinnin' in my head
Keep it play-playin' on repeat
It's like flowers in the springtime
Every day is Valentine's
So good, it's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight
Dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love, that's what your love's like

Woah-oh, woah-oh
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
Woah-oh, woah-oh
That's what your love, that's what your love's like

Stop signs I keep on running into
Red lights make me wanna scream like
Why can't it just be only you and me
All the time? (All the time)

In a world no one can find

Your love's like breathing in the salty air of summer
On a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinnin' in my head
Keep it play-playin' on repeat
It's like flowers in the springtime
Every day is Valentine's
So good, it's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight
Dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love, that's what your love's like

Woah-oh, woah-oh
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
Woah-oh, woah-oh
That's what your love, that's what your love's like

When life has left me numb
And I need a pick-me-up
There's no better rush than your love
Your love, your love

Your love's like breathing in the salty air of summer
On a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinnin' in my head
Keep it play-playin' on repeat
It's like walking on the ceiling
Can't compare the feeling
Better than I could ever describe
It's like soakin' in the sunrise
Not a worry on my mind (On my mind)
That's what your love, that's what your love's like

Woah-oh, woah-oh (Hey)
That's what your love, that's what your love's like
(La-da-da-da-da-da)
Woah-oh, woah-oh (Yeah)
That's what your love, that's what your love's like

[Song 93: White Flag]
24 ContributorsTranslationssrpskiWhite Flag Lyrics
Take, take it all away
Save my heart for another day
I'm up late on the telephone
And I'm all alone with a dial tone
Wait, wait 'til the sun is up
Drown my dreams in a coffee cup
Palms out, wanna beg for luck
But I'm way too proud, never giving up

Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give
And something's got to break
I know someday, it's gonna happen
Someday, it's gonna give
Can't always be this way

And if the riptide comes to get me
Pulls me under, won't upset me
I'll go down
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll throw the white flag, I'll surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

Give, give everything I've got
Out of reach, but I'll take a shot
Kick rocks in the parking lot
Feel like giving up, but I'll never stop
Run, run, running like a fool
Never win if you never lose
And find hope in a little truth
Wanna learn new tricks, gotta jump through hoops

Oh, something's gotta happen
Something's gotta give
And something's got to break
I know someday, it's gonna happen
Someday, it's gonna give
Can't always be this way

And if the riptide comes to get me
Pulls me under, won't upset me
I'll go down
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll throw the white flag, I'll surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever
Not forever, won't stay down
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, not forever
Not forever, won't stay down

And if the riptide comes to get me
Pulls me under, won't upset me
I'll go down
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll throw the white flag, I'll surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
And if the riptide comes to get me
Pulls me under, won't upset me
I'll go down
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll throw the white flag, I'll surrender
Knock me down, not forever
Just for now

an original for all the lovers at home 🧸this is called ‘before i had love'
Before I had
Before I had love
Before I had
Before I had love

Never heard a bird sing
Never let somebody call me baby
Never woke up in the morning with that hungry feeling
Would've said falling is weak
Wouldn't switch up my plans in a blink
Wouldn't catch me crying at the movies, no no

No sky ever looked so blue
No nights staring at the moon
No song ever felt this true, mmm

Before I had love
Before I had love
Bеfore I had love
I had nothing
Beforе I had love

Why is it that
I would get on a plane
Just to go grab some dinner
And stare at your face
I just thought of it now
'Cause it's starting to rain
I remember the days
Where you'd do the same

No sky ever looked so blue
No nights staring at the moon
No song ever felt so true, mmm

Before I had love
Before I had love
Before I had love
I had nothing
Before I had love
Before I had love
Before I had love
I had nothing
Before I had
Love

Before I had
Before I had love

[Song 95: We’re the Babysitters]
14 ContributorsWe’re the Babysitters Lyrics
Hello, my name is Jenny Parker and these kids are my crew
We're in a lot of trouble and I'm not sure what to do
See it all started, when our phones made a switch
Lola lied to the parents, she's been a real witch
Kid snuck out, the kitchen caught fire
The car got towed, all because she's a liar

Now these bad guys are chasing us

We almost just died

I got a tattoo

Can you let that one slide?

This girl is ruining my life, my job, my reputation
And if we ever get home, I'm gonna need a vacation

Yeah tell 'em girl

But no matter what, I won't be a quitter
Gonna care for these kids, cause I'm a ba-by-sitter

She ain't no quitter
She's the babysitter

She ain't no quitter

She ain't no quitter

She's the babysitter

She's the babysitter
She's the babysitter
She ain't no quitter
She's the babysitter

She ain't no quitter

She's the babysitter
She's the babysitter

Hold up just a minute, that's not the straight scoop
This girl's so uptight, she's all tied in a loop

Looks Like we have ourselves a battle of the babysitters! Haha

Uh, let's rewind this movie an hour or two
The kid snuck out, I didn't have a clue

Yeah, That's true

Okay I admit it, I don't follow rules
I'm not good with kids, I'm not good at school
It wasn't my plan to steal a car
Or end up in jail or take it this far
It's true, I lied, but nobody's died
And these kids are having an incredible ride

You think you know it all, but you don't know me
See I'm more than just, Miss Spelling Bee

Wanna be a real artist
Take pictures, get gritty
On your first night out in the big, bad city
You're a cool girl, Jenny
But I'm pretty cool too

Go Lola, go Lola

In fact,  I'm just as a great as a
Babysitter as you, ha

She's right. I'm smart and I do follow rules
I work real hard, and I care about school
There's a time for fun, to let go and climb trees
But I am a real artist, everybody say "Cheese"

We're ain't no quitters
We're the babysitters

They ain't no quitters

They ain't no quitters

Yeah she's the babysitter

They're the babysitters
They're the babysitters
They ain't no quitters

No cap

They're the babysitters
They're the babysitters
They ain't no quitters
They're the babysitters
They're the babysitters
We ain't no quitters
We're the babysitters

That's right

We ain't no quitters
We're the babysitters
We're the babysitters
They ain't no quitters
They're the babysitters

Five feet to be exact
She's wonderin' why half your clothes went missin'
My body's where they're at

Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation

I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do
Just know you'll taste me too

He pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue
Hе's funny now and his jokes hit different
Guеss who he learned that from?

Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation

I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do
Just know you'll taste me too

Every time you close your eyes
And feel his lips, you're feelin' mine
And every time you breathe his air
Just know I was already there
You can have him if you like
I've been there, done that once or twice
And singin' 'bout it don't mean I care
Yeah, I know I've been known to share

Heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do (And I bet you do)

It's a narrow line I'm walking
Better watch my step
'Cause we got everybody talking
And I can hear 'em say

Maybe in another lifetime (Lifetime)
Maybe when you're older
What they don't know is
I've already made up my mind (My mind)
And yes, I know what love is

'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls with two young hearts

Two young hearts
They say we're too young

I could lie awake in darkness
Oh, just to dream of you
And you can lay your head on my chest
Yeah, just like you always do

Maybe in another lifetime (Lifetime)
Maybe when we're older
At least we know that
We've already made up our minds (Our minds)
And yes, we know what love is

'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls with two young hearts
Two young hearts, oh

We're gonna keep on runnin'
Runnin' for all that we are
We want it all or nothin'
We knew it right from the start
We are a part of somethin'
Somethin' as old as time, time, time

'Cause we are two old souls
With two young hearts
We can run
I will follow you to the end of the earth
Where we can see forever
They can never tear us apart
Two old souls with two young hearts

Two young hearts
You're never too young

Dandelions are going to seed
It's my soul I need to feed
Trees stand so tall and bare
And here I stand without a care

Pumpkin seeds stuck in my teeth
There's something more I need to be
More than just a silly girl
Waiting for the sun to hurl

Rays of sunlight
Down the sidewalk, down on me
Casting light on
The turning leaves and what I'm supposed to see

Winter's here and settled in
But where are you? I can't begin
To imagine where I went wrong
Perhaps it was when I started this song

Rays of sunlight
Reflecting off the snowflakes
There are no more crinkly leaves
I need to rake

There's a chance
A chance I need to take

Birds and bees are here again
We haven't talked since God knows when
I like to dance in the sprouting grass
If it snows again, then I'll have to ask

Why the hell are
The seasons fickle just like you?
Rip my heart in half
I'll stitch it up if it's certain we are through

Junebugs, butterflies, sand in my pants
Midnight moon and those pesky little ants
You're here once more to try your luck
Well, I'm done with you, you sneaky little

Now it's over
There's nothing left for us to do
Besides acknowledging the repelling forces
That are me and you

We'll never be as young as we are right now

So take in what's around you, put your camera down
Take a shot, give it all you got
I have a way of getting stuck on yesterday
I tend to miss the little things that come my way
Always looking forward, always looking back
They seem so near, but they're not here

'Cause time moves on so quickly
Without or with me
I've got to take a breath

And slow down, slow down, my mind is racing
Catch up, catch up, I've gotta pace myself
I'm always wandering, but I don't need to go right now
Let go, let go (Let go), we hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin (Begin) to live your life
The present is our future past
We've gotta make this moment last right now

Have you ever noticed how your heartbeat feels
When you're nervous or excited 'cause it's getting real?
Have you stopped to listen to what's in your soul?
That's your intuition and it always knows

Time moves on so quickly
Without or with me
I've got to take a breath

And slow down, slow down, my mind is racing
Catch up, catch up, I've gotta pace myself
I'm always wandering, but I don't need to go right now
Let go, let go (Let go), we hold our fears too tight
Begin, begin (Begin) to live your life
The present is our future past
We've gotta make this moment last right now

Oh, right now (Right now), right now (Right now)
Enjoy the ride, the ride that you're on
Right now, right now

But I'm pleased to know you at all
Pull me out before I'm gone

Fall asleep, but not for long

Handle them gracefully
But don't let them sift like sand

Sing of love and sing of none
Remember when you are through
I'll be here to sing along
My heart will be with you

Moments are fleeting
Each end is a greeting
To what lies ahead
So get up from your bed

Keep your eyes off the clock
Time's spent better with them locked in mine
Oh, I tell you that it's true
Every second is a treasure with you

Winds are mean and time is too
I can see them in my face
But winds have timely brought us close
Like pearls sewn into lace
He has great plans in mind for us for welfare, not for woe

Plans to give us futures
Full of goodness
Full of hope

[Song 107: Garden]
7 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolGarden Lyrics
If I had a rose, every time you took off my clothes then quickly departed
I would have a garden
If I had a match for every time you came crawlin' back
Swearin' that you never liked her
I would have a fire, hmm

If I had these things
I'd be compensated for the tears I cried
And the nights I wasted on you

If I had a brick for every time the sex was mid
And I didn't make a sound
I would have a house
If I had a dime for every message unreplied, oh
You avoidant little bitch, hmm
Well, darling, I'd be rich

If I had these things
I'd be compensated for the tears I cried, and the time I wasted
I can't get back every thing you've taken from me

If I had a note for every night you held me close
And strung my heart along
Well, I would have a song

[Song 108: 23]
7 Contributors23 Lyrics
If I met you at twenty-three
You wouldn't be so scared of learnin' to love yourself at the same time you love me
And you'd still say all the right things
But by then you'd mean them
If I met you at twenty-three
There wouldn't be no extenuating circumstances, complicatin' things
And maybe you'd know how to think about more than what you need
If I met you at twenty-three

Sometimes I catch myself, talking about us in past tense
Sometimes I catch myself, thinking how this inevitably ends

When you told me you'd never lеave
That's what I believеd
I didn't second-guess it, and that's on me
When you called me the love of your life
I took that shit hard
Guess you meant the love of your life so far

If I met you at twenty-three
I wouldn't be okay with just how comfortable you are with losing me
And I would know when I should go
Differentiate what's meant for me
From what I already know

Sometimes I catch myself, talking about us in past tense
Sometimes I catch myself, thinking how this inevitably ends

When you told me you'd never leave
That's what I believed
I didn't second-guess it, and that's on me
When you called me the love of your life
I took that shit hard
Guess you meant the love of your life so far

Guess you meant the love of your life so far

Still think about 2 a.m., two of us
Lookin' up places in New York City
Find our favorite bagel spot, walk Central Park
And wastin' too much money
You finishin' both our coffees every morning like you always do
I was plannin', you were fantasizin'

And you told me you'd never leave
That's what I believed
I didn't second-guess it, and that's on me
When you called me the love of your life
I took that shit hard
Guess you meant the love of your life so far
And you told me you'd never leave
That's what I believed
I didn't second-guess it, and that's on me
And when you called me the love of your life
I took that shit hard
Guess you meant the love of your life so far

Guess you meant the love of your life so far

[Song 109: It’s the Most Nonsense Time of The Year]
6 ContributorsIt’s the Most Nonsense Time of The Year Lyrics
It's the most nonsense time of the year
They gave me a special, they said "It would test well"
As if I had fear
It's the most nonsense time of the year

It's the ho, ho-ho-iest special of all
The champagne is bubbling
Entendres are doubling
When I deck your halls
It's the ho, ho-ho-iest special of all

There'll be songs all crescendoing, hot innuendoing
Dancers who flex and keep time
Thеre'll be wit for the smartiеs
And you know the best part is it's all on Netflix's dime

No, seriously, they told me I could have an unlimited budget as long as I go viral, so I'm gonna break the set just to do it!

It's the most nonsense time of the year
If you're hot and you're young
And your stocking's well hung
By the chimney with care
It's the most nonsense time of the year

There'll be singing and jesting, celebrity guesting
Huge packages under the tree
I'll be playing my bangers with elf doppelgängers
So please, please, please have faith in me

There are comedy specials, and there are music specials, and there are holiday specials
But who does musical comedy holiday specials?
A lot of people
But do those specials have celebrity guests?
Yes, they do!
Everyone with a musical comedy holiday special does them with celebrity guests, and this is one of those

There'll be divas so stunning and seasonal punning
And costumes in red and in green
You can watch with your aunties
I might mention panties
But don't fret, it's TV-14

Which means I'm allowed to say "fuck" three times
Fuck, just one left
Anyways, here we are
We've arrived at my set, isn't this cute?
It's exactly what my house looked like growing up
A tree, three walls, and a live studio audience

It's the most nonsense time of the year
Well, I've learned all my blocking
So please stuff my stocking with holiday cheer
It's the most nonsense time
Yes, it's the most nonsense time
What's a third really good rhyme?
Of the year

[Song 110: Waiting Room]
6 ContributorsWaiting Room Lyrics
I thought when we said our goodbye's it was over
Why’d you ask if I'd take a later flight?
You gave me just enough to fantasize
So I don't think burying this love alive
Is gonna change the way I feel tonight

Last I remember we were singing this song in your car
I look over and you were gone

Are you somewhere out there hopin’ I'll wait for you?
Are you countin' down the days 'til I break?
I don't know how long I've been in this waiting room alone
But there's only so much more I can take

Hope you know that my mama was rootin' for ya
Even though, there were nights that I lost faith
I know you said that it would be okay
But I took your word for it and I don’t feel so great
It kinda makes me sick to say, ooh, and—

Last I remember we were singing this song in your car
I look over and you were gone

Are you somewhere out there hopin’ I'll wait for you?
Are you countin’ down the days 'til I break?
I don't know how long I've been in this waiting room alone
But there’s only so much more I can take

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Last I remember there were tears fallin' down on your face
And you said that your love won't change

Are you somewhere out there hopin' I'll wait for you?
Are you countin' down the days 'til I break?
I don't know how long I've been in this waiting room alone
But there's only so much more I can take

Never been as happy as the day I met you
Never been as healthy as the day you left
I thank God we never got those matching tattoos
But I've got other ways to make sure you don't forget

Said you needed somethin' to lean on
And sadly that it couldn't be me
Must've needed somethin' to sleep on
You can catch me in your dreams
Ha-ha

I wanna be in Vogue
Cover of every issue
I want the kind of fame
Where you have to stare at my face in pictures
I wanna be in Vogue
Not for the money either
Just so you feel the pain
When you turn the page
While I'm every issue

Say it like a premonition
I can make you wait in lines for me
There won't be no competition baby
I'm the best you've ever seen

Don't need a rocket to take you to outer space
Barely need a couple minutes 'til I can't be replaced
I'ma make you lose your faith, lose your mind, you'll be mine
I'ma make you lose your faith, lose your mind, you'll be mine

So close you could touch it

If it means something to me

I bet you never thought you'd meet (Meet)

It only happens in a dream world
Maybe I was just your dream girl
Made up of all your fantasies (-Sies)
I'll make you think you're seeing things (Things)
It only happеns in a dream world
Maybe I was just your dream girl

Keep mе in your head 'cause I'll be gone before you know it
Never sleeping again, you can fuck your melatonin
When you wake up in my bed, it's gonna look like heaven, heaven
Keep me in your head 'cause I'll be gone before you know it

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, your troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Hey

And here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
And faithful friends who are dear to us
Will they gather near to us once more?
Oh, hoo

And through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
But 'til then, we'll have to muddle through somehow, no
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Will they gather near to us once more?

Don't you dare look out your window, darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside your door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone...
Gone

Just close your eyes

And I just need a reminder from time to time

Couldn't get to bed without no melatonin
I used to put the toxic in oxytocin
Stability, I might just dip my toes in
Even if it's a little colder

Fuck it, I'm fine I'm truly sublime

Keeps me up at night I missed it
She got all the midnight conversations
Got her name tied onto every heartfelt song you've written
She got all the shit I didn't

Well, maybe I'm a little afraid that you'll never fully be mine, fully be mine
Maybe I'm a little bit late, or maybe I'm right on time, hm

I wanna be the last onе you love
The one you hold a littlе tighter 'cause the others never meant this much, oh
I wanna be the last one you love
When you're talkin' 'bout forever doesn't matter who the first one was

Does it sting a little bit when I think about
All the others girl that you were kissin', parade around? Uh-huh
Maybe it's okay, come to think of it
They can have the memories, I'm living it

Maybe I'm ahead of myself thinkin' what our kids will look like, look like
Maybe I'm a little bit late, or maybe I'm right on ti-i-i-ime

I wanna be the last one you love
The one you hold a little tighter 'cause the others never meant this much, oh
I wanna be the last one you love
When you're talkin' 'bout forever doesn't matter who the first one was

The last one, wanna be the last one
Wanna be the last one, mm-mm

But the truth is, baby, I'm more fun
Wanna be the last one

It's in every movie and every poem that I have been readin'

Bеneath the chandeliеr is all I need to know

So don't make my body
No don't leave me hanging

But you never see it

When you look at me like I'm Lady Monroe
The way my fingertips fall in your hand
Beneath the chandelier is all I need to know

[Song 122: Christmas the Whole Year Round]
13 ContributorsChristmas the Whole Year Round Lyrics
One, two, one, two, three

Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this
Feeling we're feeling now
Gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing
We'll keep the whole world singing
Feel so good, why stop now?
Let's make Christmas the whole year round

I don't care if snow stops falling down
Santa's come and gone, yeah he's left town
I don't need a Christmas tree
Mistletoe, or red and green
All I need is you next to me
To make every night Christmas Eve

Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this
Feeling we're feeling now
Gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing
We'll keep the whole world singing
Feel so good, why stop now?
Let's make Christmas the whole year round

All those pretty lights have been put away
And old Rudolph is gone on holiday
We'll keep that fire burning
Though the calendar is turning
Why stop at 1, hey we're full
When we can have 364 more

Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this
Feeling we're feeling now
We gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing
We'll keep the whole world singing
Feel so good, why stop now?
Let's make Christmas the whole year round

I don't need a Christmas tree
Mistletoe or red and green
All I need is you next to me
To make every night Christmas Eve

Let's make the whole year Christmas
No reason to forget this
Feeling we're feeling now
Gotta keep it going all year round
Let's keep the sleigh bells ringing
We'll keep the whole world singing
Feel so good, why stop now?
Let's make Christmas the whole year
Make Christmas the whole year
Let's make Christmas the whole year round
Let's make Christmas the whole year round

[Song 123: Broke My Phone]
11 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolBroke My Phone Lyrics
Lately, texts have been gettin' laxy
Watchin' you move just like a movie (Ah)
The more we're talkin', the more it's hurtin'
Couldn't wait to do it in person

You're kinda set in your ways
You're kinda settin' me straight
If you've been havin' your fun
While I'm alone with the pain
You don't make it easy
You're just makin' it hard
And now your name is the reason
That I'm fallin' apart

Last night was the last time
I watched all our videos
Last night was the first time
Tears ever broke my phone

Broke my phone
(Tears ever broke my phone)
You broke my phone

Guess there ain't no way to fix it
Once my eyes started drippin'
The connection, it was slippin'
Heard your voice and I'm weak
If it's just about a body
I could have 'bout anybody
Love was never just a hobby for me

You're kinda set in your ways
You're kinda settin' me straight
If you've been havin' your fun
While I'm alone with the pain
You don't make it easy
You're just makin' it hard
And now your name is the reason
That I'm fallin' apart

Last night was the last time
I watched all our videos
Last night was the first time
Tears ever broke my phone

Broke my phone
(Tears ever broke my phone)
You broke my phone

Never miss a call from you again
No more reminiscin' anything
Never miss a call from you again
No more reminiscin' anything

Last night was the last time (Time)
Last night was the first time
Tears ever broke my phone

Broke my phone
You broke my phone

6 ContributorsCruise Lyrics
There's a warmth in your face that's familiar
And out of nowhere I'm spilling my secrets to you
You're made of safety with sprinkles of danger
I think I'm falling in love with a stranger

But I won't waste a second with—

You were meant for me to find
It's out of my hands
There's nothing left to do but
Cruise and just enjoy the ride
Wherever I go, I wanna go with you

Let's make a memory in every city
So when you visit again, you can't help but think of me
Sorry I'm moving too fast
Just wanna hit the gas, and never look backwards
Tell mе are you good with that?

Baby, I won't waste a second with—

You wеre meant for me to find
It's out of my hands
There's nothing left to do but
Cruise and just enjoy the ride
Wherever I go, I wanna go with you

This moment, take it I don't want it back
Just promise you'll always look at me like that
You were meant for me to find
Wherever I go, I wanna go with you

You were meant for me to find
You know it baby
Cruise and just enjoy the ride
One, two

You were meant for me to find
It's out of my hands
There's nothing left to do but
Cruise and just enjoy the ride
Wherever I go, I wanna go with you

This moment, take it I don't want it back
Just promise you'll always look at me like that
You were meant for me to find
Wherever I go, I wanna go with you

14 ContributorsGood Problem To Have Lyrics“Good Problem To Have*” is an unreleased song by Sabrina Carpenter that leaked on May 31, 2022. The song was recorded in 2017.
Everybody warns me but they don't know how you make me feel
They say I should be with someone who's going somewhere
But when I'm with you, I'm there for real

Nobody sees what we do
Nobody hears what you say
Nobody knows me like you
How could they?

Everyone says you're a problem
Everyone says you're bad
But you're a good, good problem to have
And everyone says you're danger (Danger)
But you turn me on like that
'Cause you're a good, good problem to havе

A really good problem
Good, good, real good problеm
Good, good
'Cause you're a good, good problem to have

Call me up at midnight, as usual, you're hanging on the edge
Baby, I love the view when I stand by you
Holding my breath as we're on the ledge

I love the words on your lips
I love the way that you think
Your mind is like an abyss
Dark as ink

Everyone says you're a problem
Everyone says you're bad
But you're a good, good problem to have
And everyone says you're danger (Danger)
But you turn me on like that
'Cause you're a good, good problem to have

A really good problem
Good, good, real good problem
Good, good
'Cause you're a good, good problem to have

Everybody says you're a problem
Everyone says you're bad (Oh, nah)
But you're a good, good problem to have
And everyone says you're danger (Danger)
But you turn me on like that
(Easy turning me on like that)
'Cause you're a good, good problem to have

A really good problem
Good, good, real good problem
Good, good
'Cause you're a good-
You're a really good problem to have

Feel you inching closer on the sofa, what you indicating?
You took off your jacket, now I think I'm hyperventilating
Ooh

I don't want you to know that you're on it all the time
Yeah, I know that you're hesitant, lemme clarify
For you

You have my permission
To pull me under, stop the overthinking
Throw me on the table and forget the dishes
Whatever you've been hoping, you've been wishing
You have my permission
To go all night without the intermission
Yeah, but I'm the show and, oh, you're a musician
Whatever you've been hoping, you've been wishing
You have my permission

I don't want a tour around your housе, we're getting off thе topic
I just wanna feel your hands on me, so take 'em out your pockets
Ooh

I don't want you to think that I got a dirty mind
I don't want you to know that you're on it all the time
Yeah, I know that you're hesitant, lemme clarify

To pull me under, stop the overthinking

7 ContributorsRed Flags Lyrics
I've always wanted what's best for you
But I guess I always thought it would be me
I always liked myself next to you
But I can't make that where you wanna be

You told me you loved me way too soon
Mmm-mmm, should've known how easily things change for you
Oh-oh-oh, mmm, I probably should've panicked
But your red flags were so romantic
Mmm-mmm-mmm, I still don't understand it
How your red flags were so romantic

You make me laugh while we're arguin'
So we never let the fights get very far
It felt so right it was startlin'
And that's makes this all so fucking hard

You told mе you loved me way too soon
Should've known how еasily things change for you
Mmm-mmm-mmm, I probably should've panicked
But your red flags were so romantic
Mmm-mmm-mmm, I still don't understand it
How your red flags were so romantic

Everybody tells me it gets better, wait and see
But all that I can picture is a future, you and me

Mmm-mmm-mmm, I probably should've panicked
But your red flags were so romantic
Mmm-mmm-mmm, I still don't understand it
How your red flags were so romantic

[Song 128: Wasn’t Love]
4 ContributorsWasn’t Love Lyrics
I should've known
You need validation from people that hurt you
For any consolation, you know I'd never hurt you
Is that why you don't need it from me?

I should've guessed
That something was strange when you told me you moved on from her in a day
But that was a lie, like when you said that we're meant to be

I would never lose you if I had the option

Why did I think it was passionate, the way we dealt with conflict? (Ah-ah)
Why'd I not trust the feeling that was always in my stomach?
It wasn't love, you sure as hell convinced me it was
But that wasn't love, it couldn't have been love

I shouldn't have fought as hard as I did
To be with someonе who wouldn't fight for me a little bit
And I cried thе day I found out your love songs weren't about me

You would never choose me when you had the option

Why did I think it was passionate, the way we dealt with conflict? (Ah-ah)
Why'd I not trust the feeling that was always in my stomach?
It wasn't love, you sure as hell convinced me it was
But that wasn't love, it couldn't have been love

It wasn't love, wasn't love
It wasn't love, wasn't love

My mom said she'd kiss my head now if she could
She told me her first love didn't treat her good
But she's glad it happened
'Cause otherwise, she wouldn't have me

11 ContributorsJust In Case Lyrics
I've been thinking about you, way more than I like to admit it
Always people around you, almost wrote you back but I didn't

You know, you know we make sense
I know the thought is in with your head
Yeah, we know, we know how this ends
Yeah

I put my gold rings on, did up my nighttime face
I'm drinkin' somethin' strong, just in case
The two of us collide, we end up at my place
I cleaned up real, real nice, just in case, la-la
And I got everything you'll ever need
And I think it's gonna happen, baby, ah-ah
I just wanna feel you, feel me
Yeah, I think it's gonna happen, mm-mm

I wrote your name on paper and I threw it into flames
God would never let the way I'm lookin' go to waste
I have some fantasies, yeah, I need you to entertain
You told me that your plans changed
Things are startin' to take shape

You know, you know we make sense
I know the thought is in with your head
Yeah, we know, we know how this ends
Yeah, I just don't know when

I put my gold rings on, did up my nighttime face
I'm drinkin' somethin' strong, just in case
The two of us collide, we end up at my place
I cleaned up real, real nice, just in case, la-la
And I got everything you'll ever need
And I think it's gonna happen, baby, ah-ah
I just wanna feel you, feel me
Yeah, I think it's gonna happen

[Song 130: Your Existence]
5 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolYour Existence Lyrics
Music has sounded better when you were singin' it to me
Champagne tasted sweeter when you were sharin' it with me
Conversations were longer, 'cause talkin' to you was so easy
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm

Am I just supposed to say, “Oh, well”
And shut the door?
Like the nights we spent together were fun
And nothing more?
I don't even remember where my life was before
You camе along and changed it all

How can I just pretend thе sun is shinin'?
When am I gonna find a silver linin'?
How am I just supposed to go on livin'
Since I've been made aware of your existence?

Ta-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da

Wish I could see something funny without wantin' to tell you about it
Achievin' an accomplishment without thinkin' that you would be proud of it
If I'm breathin' the same air you're breathin', I might pull on my heel
And if one more person tells me it's gonna be fun, I'm gon' be screamin'

How can I just pretend the sun is shinin'?
When am I gonna find a silver linin'?
How am I just supposed to go on livin'
Since I've been made aware of your existence?
I wanna take it back, but then I don't 'cause
I guess I'd rather known than never known you
But how am I supposed to go on livin'
Since I've been made aware of your existence? (uh-uh)

Ta-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da

This ain't no Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
How can I erase the fact that everything with you just felt so right?

How can I just pretend the sun is shinin'?
When am I gonna find a silver linin'?
How am I just supposed to go on livin'
Since I've been made aware of your existence?
I wanna take it back, but then I don't 'cause
I guess I'd rather known than never known you
But how am I supposed to go on livin'
Since I've been made aware of your existence? (Uh-uh)

6 ContributorsStrawberry Moon Lyrics
So that's what all the old songs were talking about
Yeah, what you want, don't always get it
Only thing I'm positive about are my doubts
Not really bitter, just a realist

I've come this far, can't stop, but without you here I'm lost

I'll grow out of my clothes and go a new direction
That's what I'll do, that's what I'll do
I'm making wishes, having heart-to-hearts
Under the Strawberry Moon, Strawberry Moon
I'll grow out of my clothes and go a new direction
That's what I'll do, that's what I'll do
I'll settle in the ways I haven't changed under the Strawberry Moon

Under the Strawberry Moon
Under the Strawberry Moon

Guess everybody thinks they know what's best for my health
A little less of this and more of that
Well, God bless everybody but go fuck yourself
I'm still not bitter, I'm just kinda sad

I've come this far, can't stop, but without you here I'm lost

I'll grow out of my clothes and go a new direction
That's what I'll do, that's what I'll do
I'm making wishes, having heart-to-hearts
Under the Strawberry Moon, Strawberry Moon
I'll grow out of my clothes and go a new direction
That's what I'll do, that's what I'll do
I'll settle in the ways I haven't changed under the Strawberry Moon

Under the Strawberry Moon
Under the Strawberry Moon

Woah
Woah
I wanna lay down my head in a bed where the flowers grow

I've come this far, can't stop, but without you here I'm lost

I'll grow out of my clothes and go a new direction
That's what I'll do, that's what I'll do
I'm making wishes, having heart-to-hearts
Under the Strawberry Moon, Strawberry Moon
I'll grow out of my clothes and go a new direction
That's what I'll do, that's what I'll do
I'll settle in the ways I haven't changed under the Strawberry Moon

I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
But just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy

Yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby

Please, please, please

Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)

Well, I have a fun idea, babe (Uh-huh), maybe just stay inside
I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice (It's so nice, right?)
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really (Kinda), really, really

Woke up this morning with you by my side
And your hair was a mess, but you kissed me and asked if I slept alright
We're havin' trouble leaving on time
You told me it just feels so right to be here again, with me again

So tell me why I gotta live without you?
'Cause all I wanna do is be around you
In my arms, I could've sworn that you didn’t leave
It felt so real to me, just like a fever dream
Why does it feel so good to disregard reality?

With everything in me, I tried to leave it wherе we were that night
But how do wе meet in a whole other city like it's not a sign?
For moments, we're so fucking aligned
Two minutes later, might be the last time I see you again
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm

So tell me why I gotta live without you?
'Cause all I wanna do is be around you
In my arms, I could've sworn that you didn't leave
It felt so real to me, just like a fever dream
Why does it feel so good to disregard reality?

Meet me when I close my eyes
Come sing me a lullaby
I'll be your Lucy in the sky
Don't wake me up until you're mine
Meet me when I close my eyes
Come sing me a lullaby

Baby, you were so in love you couldn't see a motive
Everything you gave to them was givin' off devotion
Baby, I'd be lyin' if I said that you was hopeless
'Cause you were livin' twenty years without them, never noticed

But people leave to show you what you're worth
The more you're holdin' on, the more that you gon' stunt your growth
So take a break, you're not the kinda girl who waits

You say you're done, be done with it (Uh-huh)
Doesn't deserve you, never did (Uh-huh)
Just go ahead and take the hint (I know you're missin' him so much)
Trust me, it's not once in a life (Ah)

How many nights are you gon' keep on stayin' in?

The words are there, but without commitment
Can't change what's already written

But people leave to show you what you're worth
The more you're holdin' on, the more that you gon' stunt your growth

Say you gave me something
When I had everything
When I'm with you
I find the piece

So I took your hand and you slammed on the gas
And I swear to God I'll never look back, back, back
Oh, I'll never look back

'Cause, baby, with you
I ain't got nothing to hide
I'll wear this love in my eyes
'Cause anywhere that we're going, yeah, I know it's gon' be paradise

I, I, I, I, I think I need u, mmm
I, I, I, I said, “I think I need u”
I, I, I, I said, “I think I need u”
I, I, I, I said, “I think I need u”

[Song 139: Sir]
6 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolSir Lyrics
Excuse me, sir
I'd like to have a conversation
Tell me 'bout the things that make you question everything
About who you were
Did it make you wanna change the station?
Did it make you think that no one's ever really listening?

Well, I don't know myself much better
We could find shit out together
You just tell me where you wanna start

For the first time, it feels simple
Like I don't have to put it on
You remind me what I wished for
Whеn I was young
Young

Sometimes
I think about how I must have donе
Something right
Or maybe it's just good karma from
A past life
'Cause last night, I just feel like I had something on my side

And for the first time, it feels simple
Like I don't have to put it on
You remind me what I wished for
When I was young
Young

I don't know myself much better
We could find shit out together
You just tell me where you wanna start

What if I told you it was simple
And you don't have to put it on
You remind me what I wished for
When I was young
Young

I have to do one fuck up every take?
I like that-

3 ContributorsFeather / Nonsense Lyrics

(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)

It feels so good
Not carin' where you are tonight
And it feels so good
Not pretendin' to like the wine you like

Well, I slam the door, I hit ignore
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked, excited to never talk, I
I'm so sorry for your loss

I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind (Ah)
Floatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time (Ah)
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch (A bitch)
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic"
I feel so much lighter like a fеather with you out my life
With you out my life

But I can't hеlp myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like ("Bleh-blah-bleh-blee")

Hello
Oh, hey
No, I'm like mid-performance at the VMAs, why?
He's here?
Oh my god, I'm gonna call you back


Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to "Don't Leave Me Alone"
You said you like my eyes, you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh

But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-blee"
I don't want no one else, baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote, it's about you and me

I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin'

I'm talkin' all around the clock
Hope nobody knocks
Opposite of soft
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?

But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-bleh-blee"
I don't want no one else, baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote, it's about you and me

I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I (Had to hit the octave)
I think I got an ex, but I forgot
I can't find my chill, I must've (Lost it)
I don't even know, I'm talkin' (Nonsense)
I'm talkin', I'm talkin'

This song catchier than chickenpox is
I bet your house is where my other (Sock is)
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a (Pop hit)
How quickly can you take your clothes off? Pop quiz
He said that it's bigger than a Moonman
Guess that means I'm holdin' it with two hands

It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
But just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby

Please, please, please
Don't prove I'm right
And please, pleasе, please
Don't bring me to tеars when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)

Well, I have a fun idea, babe (Uh-huh), maybe just stay inside
I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice (It's so nice, right?)
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really (Kinda), really, really

Please, please, please (Please don't prove I'm right)
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing (Heartbreak is one thing), my ego's another (Ego's another)
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)

If you wanna go and be stupid
Don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically

[Song 142: Bad At Breaking Up]
5 ContributorsBad At Breaking Up Lyrics
“I don't want to ruin this”
Is a funny thing to say
When we haven't been together
For sixty-seven days

And every conversation feels normal
That's the weirdest part
When we try to keep it informal
End up in the dark
All this logic I've been ignoring
To be in your arms
And the more that we do this
Don't make it any less hard

Say you gotta leave, so why'd you kinda stay?
You're always my almost, I'm your just in case
Each time we decide to go our separate ways
We don't go far enough
Halfway hold on to love
We don't go far enough
We're bad at breaking up

We'rе bad at breaking up

It's objectively too much now, but I still anticipatе
When we talk for hours and hours, past our expiration date
And every conversation feels normal
That's the weirdest part
When we try keeping it casual
End up in the dark
All this logic I've been ignoring
To be in your arms
And the more that we do this
Don't make it any less hard

Say you gotta leave, so why'd you kinda stay?
You're always my almost, I'm your just in case
Each time we decide to go our separate ways
We don't go far enough
Halfway hold on to love
We don't go far enough
We're bad at breaking up
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
We're bad at breaking up
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
We're bad at breaking up

Keep me on a string, but I hold it so tight
And this toxicity gets to me just right
We're not done with this saga
This late night TV drama
And when it ends, I'll be a wreck
So let me have this for a sec

Say you gotta leave, so why'd you kinda stay?
You're always my almost, I'm your just in case
Each time we decide to go our separate ways
We don't go far enough
Halfway hold on to love
Say you gotta leave, so why'd you kinda stay?
You're always my almost, I'm your just in case
Each time we decide to go our separate ways
We don't go far enough
Halfway hold on to love
We're scared of losing us
We're bad at breaking up

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're bad at breaking up
Ah-ah-yeah, ah-ah-yeah
Ah-ah-la-la, we're scared of losing us
Yeah, we're bad at breaking up

My mom loves her purse, daddy loves his telescope
Sammy loves her spy kit, Peter loves his jump rope
Ooh, yeah
My sister Amy gets a bike, brother gets a tambourine
And Amy's husband Dave gets, um, pass
My mom loves cashmere, my father loves photography
And Amy's husband Dave loves Amy

Giving gifts fills me with joy
Wrapping up each little toy
Eyes so brightly ooh and ah
Now what do I get my brother-in-law?

Hey, you haven't given me anything yet
Right

Sammy is a whiz at math, Peter is an athlete
Amy's an adventurer and her husband Dave
I don't really know a lot about
I think he mentioned baseball
Is cash faux pas?
Maybe he likes IPAs
Who is my brother-in-law?

Giving gifts fills me with joy
Wrapping up each little toy
Eyes so brightly ooh and ah
What the **** do I get my brother-in-law?

I like food and I like pants
And I like blue and I like music
And I like sports
Okay

I got you a journal and your new perfume
I'm not gonna give you a gift until you give me one
Who is this man? What does he do?
I've known him ten years and I don't have a clue
Ooh, yeah

So what? He just, like, hangs out?
Yeah, when he's not at work
What's his job again?
Oh, I forget

Giving gifts fills me with joy
Wrapping up each little toy
Eyes so brightly ooh and ah
Seriously, what the hell do I get him?

Here is a shaving kit, here is a bracelet
And for my brother-in-law

A phone charger
I love it, I've always needed one of these
You're so interesting
Where'd you get this?
You're like a genius
You're really something special, Sabrina
May I hug you?
Yeah, okay
You really made this a really awesome Christmas
I really care about you
Honey, stop hugging my sister
Oh, I'm sorry about that

What the **** do I get my brother-in-law?

[Song 144: Fall Apart]
9 ContributorsFall Apart Lyrics
Standing in the dark with you
I thank my lucky stars
That all those movie scenes aren't just wishful thinking
If you believe that it can happen to you

I can feel your eyes on me, I've got no place to hide
If it were brighter you could see my cheeks turn red
Oh, it's so quiet I can hear my heartbeat in my head

When he takes you by the hand
You gotta listen to your heart
Don't try to understand
Just fall apart
'Cause the story isn't told
You're only at the start
Forget everything you know
And just fall apart

I don't have a role, right now I'm playing myself
There's no camera or director standing by
What do I do? I keep forgetting all my stupid lines!

When he takes you by the hand
You gotta listen to your heart
Don't try to understand
Just fall apart
'Cause the story isn't told
You're only at the start
Forget everything you know
And just fall apart

Remember when Spider-Man kissed Mary Jane upside down in the rain?
She didn't need to know his name, she couldn't even see his face

So when he takes you by the hand
You gotta listen to your heart
Don't try to understand
Just fall apart
'Cause the story isn't told
You're only at the start
Forget everything you know
And just fall apart

So when he takes you by the hand
You gotta listen to your heart
Don't try to understand
Just fall apart
'Cause the story isn't told
You're only at the start
Forget everything you know
And just fall apart
Just fall apart
And just fall apart

Guess that's just the story of us
It's bound to be ambiguous
I don't even care to be frustrated

Take risks, but I don't mind
We're going off script for your lo-lo-lo-love
Don't know where it's going
'Cause baby we're going off script

Save all of your good advice
Need to see what it's like to learn my wrongs from my rights
Even I can't predict my next move
I might change my mind out the blue
I know only one thing is true
Is that since I'm addicted to you

I'm going off script for your lo-lo-lo-love (Lo-lo-lo-love)
Take risks, but I don't mind
