Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (Uh)

All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms (Ooh, yeah)
Layin', we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde, huh
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

Put that spotlight on her face (Spotlight)
Put that spotlight on her face (Ah, yeah)
We gon' pipe up and turn up (Pipe up)
We gon' light up and burn up (Burn up)

You and I take a ride down the boulevard (Yeah)
And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good lord

Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out a spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia (Info)
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy (Flash)
She swallowed the bottle while I sit back and smoke gelato (Ah)
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand paintin', Picasso (Hey)
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho (Woo)
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo (Flash)
She havin' it, went to college, workin' on her bachelor (College)
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us (Woo)
Average, I'ma make a million on the average (M's)
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it (Skrrt)

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)

Hey!
Now nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe

And do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

And do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)
To memorize the way you shock me (Zap)
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

Don't be afraid to catch feels (Ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels (Straight up)
Feels with me (Woah)

Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking, you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Flyin' first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (I know)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Woah, woah, woah
Feels with me
Don't be afraid to catch feels (No, no)
Don't be afraid, baby
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Woah, okay)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
I know, I know, I know, I know
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

A collaboration between Khalid and Calvin was first hinted at two months earlier from this tweet:
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe

Got L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci (Get what I'm sayin'?)
Got L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci (Get what I'm sayin'?)
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn
We deserve Grammys and some Oscars, damn
They deserve Whammys, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah

I come through with strippers and some shottas
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (Cream I make)
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (Shit I say)
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (Fold up)
I was in the double R when I rolled up (When I rolled up)

I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe

Pluto
Gotta dig what I'm sayin', Chanel drapes on me, baby
Gotta dig what I'm sayin', she look like she's sponsored by Mercedes
Dig what I'm sayin', this Creed cologne is on me, baby (You dig?)
Dig what I'm sayin'? I'm goin' hard (Hard, yeah)
I pop bubbly in your memory
You should be glad I'm showin' you sympathy (Showin' you sympathy)
I gave you real love out the gutter (Out the gutter)
Ever let you go, you gon' suffer (You gon' suffer from it)

I come through with strippers and some shottas (Shottas)
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (Cream I make)
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (Shit I say)
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (Fold up)
I was in the double R when I rolled up (When I rolled up)

Yeah, L-O-V-E on my right leg
Nah, Hendrix overload, dig what I'm sayin'?
I feel like I should be giving up
You can leave if it's too much
But I'm tired of you leading me on, oh no
I don't like where this shit is going
I mean, I've been stuck in all your apologies
Gave you my all but you want more from me
Keep your love, it doesn't feel the same
I hope it hurts you when you're hearin' my name

And now my eyes are open

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free

42 ContributorsSweet Nothing Lyrics
You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushin' out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'


It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'


And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing (Woah, woah, woah)
Nothing

Woah, woah, woah, sweet nothin' (Woah)

Feedin' the press, when we don't speak
But we're both with somebody else

And, oh, I lost the feeling, but I try to hold on
I thought the end of love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
When there's no getting through, I won't hold back
I will throw down everything in life, I know now
I've been layin' on the floor, sleepin' on the ground
I would give up everything in life I'd know how

'Cause I can't stop wondering if I was
Too late to see the signs
If I could go back, with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you, give into you

Oh, when the moon was shinin' bright before morning
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shinin' bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
Visions in my mind about to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down, the other way around
I don't want the words 'til I can't make a sound

'Cause I can't stop wondering if I was
Too late to see the signs
If I could go back, with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you, give into you

Can't hold back, reachin' out
I, I, I was livin' in the heat of the moment
Between us, I told you that
I, I, I was livin' in the heat of the moment
I'd give in
I, I, I was livin' in the heat of the moment
I'd give in
I, I, I was livin' in the heat of the moment
I'd give in
I, I, I was livin' in the heat of the moment
I'd give into you, give into you

I'd give in

Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old and something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle

We're drinking from the bottle

Yeah, I was done with staying, getting it wrong (Yeah)
Then everything is alright (Woo)
Got them girls going Heidi Klum
The Kardashians, Rihanna, all types
If you ain't lean, then you in the wrong scene
If you ain't high, then you're not on my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need no sparklers or nothin'
Just keep the bottles coming all night

Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot

Hoping that you'll find me

And maybe we're not just strangers

Only ever makes the heart go stronger

Yeah (Getting it in from here to China)
Yo
Aight, let me just kill this right now, quickly

Super trippy, riding through the gritty inner city
Roll with the committee, handle your business or handle the pity
All I see is arse and titties
And a bunch of hippie chicks that's ready to show me tricks
They're doing the splits, I'm all up in the mix
A choir out the mist, I'm taking trips
I'm in a Ferrari looking sick
I'm in a Ferrari looking slick and letting the engine rip
And gettin' the tyre a-grippin', a-slippin' and slidin'
Turning the music up, I'm vibing
Now I'm flying, Lord, strike me if I'm lying
I ain't perfect, but I'm trying
Going Super Saiyan, buying anything that catches my eye
'Cause I'm a provider, getting it in from here to China
It's so minor, I'm a survivor, never retire
I'm a black tiger, I'm ready to blaze the fire, live wire
Now I'm rolling through the shires
Blazing the green to get me higher
Now I'm inspired, putting the pressure on the back tyres
Making a hasty get away
Having a better day in every way than yesterday
I guess there’s nothing left to say

Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)

Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)

Yo, yo
Wind in my face, chilling in Versace shades
Wearing a fresh pair of gaze, looking like I've just been paid
Stupid, I don't play no games, switching out lanes on these lames
Switching out dames, simple and plain, no, I can't be contained
Plus, I'm raw and untamed, I'm so far from mundane
Getting ghost is my aim, I suggest you do the same
Taking a trip out to Spain with my girl Mary Jane
And she stays on my brain, life's a big gravy train
Paparazzi on my case, giving chase
Cameras flashing in my face
All up in my space, gotta pick up the pace
Singing Amazing Grace
I'm in an amazing place with crazy peeps
I ain't like them other lazy apes, I used to blaze the tapes
So now I stay, hoping for my break, making no mistakes
Now I'm rolling with the breaks
But still book time for my original mates
So we don't bubble with hate, we just get on with it
You brothers are constipated and your shit is overrated
You should save it

Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)

Lick the blood stain from your finger, say, "What do you see?"
Remind you that whatever you get is what you want it to be

And I was told there's not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state you're in
I tell my good friends, get out the way
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend

Pushing knobs, pushing faders, but I don't know what they do
This reflection in my mirror reminds me of you
When I tilt it towards the sunlight, you fall out of view

Cat got your tongue, girl, say what's on your mind

Girl, take it low, kiss it like a mistletoe

You that thang that I crave (Crave)
It's been a hell of a wonderful day (Day)
I guess I'm gettin' the things that I prayed for
Love when you have it your way (Way)
Catch your open shot and I shoot (Shoot)
What would you do if you were in my shoes? (Shoes)
Girl, I love the way that you move, ooh (Move)

We gotta get the feelin' right (Right)
The weed ain't gon' smoke itself tonight (Oh yeah)
Your troubles, I move them out the way
Until you got nothin' more to say (Oh yeah, you arе)
From all that I can, and all that you are
Make me feel good, takin' mе far
From all that I can, you're all that I know (Alright)

You're a hell of a woman, straight up out of dreams
When you say you love me, tell me what you mean
To havin' hope, kiss me 'til we gettin' old
Girl, take it low, blow it like a whistle, oh

Dollar signs
Said, "Fuck this shit," you know what's on my mind
Stay on your hustle, you be on your grind
Rip out your heart and left it on the line
You running out of time
You lose your mind, you lose your fuckin' mind
You lose your mind, you lose your fuckin' mind
You close your eyes, you're seeing dollar signs, dollar signs

People searching for answers
While the world's spinning faster
They say love is the answer
All you see is dollar signs
Dollar signs
Dollar signs

Dollar signs
I told you once, ain't gotta tell you twice
If life's a game, I'm throwing loaded dice
These other girls ain't really what you like, what you like
Feeling like running away
Stressing 'bout nothing all day
Money and hoes, come and they go
Let them go, fuck 'em away
Everything ain't what it seems
If it's all just a dream
I believe it, I believe it

People searching for answers
While the world's spinning faster
They say love is the answer
All you see is dollar signs
Dollar signs

Love is something vicious
Still, it isn't right
Seeing all them secrets in your eyes
Meet me in the middle
Underneath the lights
You know I ain't got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight

Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothin' left
Hey, I've been wantin' to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing

And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you cryin'

Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby

Nowadays, I'm just a ***** to everybody else
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself, ay
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you cryin'

Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby

(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
I'm not gon' act like I don't love you, baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (True)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (No)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (Yeah)
I 'member all of them times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Oh, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (Yeah)
Had to get counseling from my moms, she's a heartbreak teacher (Oh yeah)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face, made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, oh-oh-oh

Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?

26 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsEspañolDay One Lyrics
Men too young to drive cars
Back of my scooter you ride
Girbaud in black and white zombas
Countin' stars in the night
Honeybuns with extra frost
Man, our parents would fight
Teenage years we would question
Kiss while listenin' to Tribe
They don't understand us
You're the only one that'll stand up
Put your hand up
Even when I don't have a plan, but
You with me, you get me
And when my heart get broken, you fix me
No one compare
Day one, you were there

There's some shit on them days that just won't let up
That only you'll offer to do
'Cause I forget, I always feel so much better
After I talk to you
'Cause you my day one (Day one), day one (Day one)
Day one (Day one), day one (Day one)
'Cause you my day one (Day one), day one (Day one)
Day one (Day one)
After you locked up, fuck what they talkin' 'bout

I don't chase them, I replace them
Hunnid dollar bills' like a drink, I waste them
Favorite dope boys are the ones, they traced him
King Push been around the world, might Ma$e them
Spinnin' like there's ten of me, shootin' at my frenemies
Dirty money, let it spin dry 'til we Kennedys
Let's talk symmetry, his and hers Patek, light flex for our energy
Wish I could go back and just talk to beginner me
Of how I should invest what I spent on the shimmery
No regrets, baguettes is blushing
Gosha on the sweats, all in Russian
Click, clack, means no discussion, oh
Who you know chart number one like Bruno?
Still tip the scale like sumo
Erase you out your spot like Pluto
Got love for all my day unos

There's some shit on them days that just won't let up
That only you'll offer to do
'Cause I forget, I always feel so much better
After I talk to you
'Cause you my day one (Day one), day one (Day one)

Too fast and I didn't know
Then I'm in a toast to daylight
You're here, no way to let go
Don't look back when you're holding me

One day, we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms
We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever
'Cause we'll wake up together

I got something and it feels right
What I needed to be, can't control what you feel for me
I was watching you the whole night
I can never explain how the magic was made
Don't look back when you're holding me
'Cause I know what this love was meant to be

One day, we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms

Sun is up, back to life, my eyes are open
And the last thing I remember was you holding me
The fact that I still love you in the morning
Tells me that your body might be home for me
We were dancing, we were wild in the ocean
When the crowd is all around me, you're still all I see
And the way you lay me down and break me open
Tells me that your body might be home for me

We were dancing, we were wild in the ocean, ocean, ocean
Love the way you lay me down and break me open, open, open
We were dancing, we were wild in the ocean, ocean, ocean
Love the way you lay me down and break me open, open

The moon is up, I'm back to life, my eyes are open
I could lay right here forever if you're holding me
It's the way you love me even though I'm broken
Tells me that your body might be home for me
We were dancing by the tides in the moment
Looked around and when I found you, finally found peace
It's the way you fill me up with your emotion
Tells me that your body might be home for me

We were dancing, we were wild in the ocean, ocean, ocean
Love the way you lay me down and break me open, open, open

And after we go around the globe, let's take this shit beyond the galaxy

Bang, everybody, if you step up in the party
And we do it, are you ready or not?
Flyin' like a rocket, ain't nobody else can stop it
I'll be movin', are you ready or not?
Watch the way we kill 'em and you know we gonna get 'em
And hit 'em then, are you ready or not?
Tell me if you're ready or not
Show mе if you're really ready or not

Plеase be clear, I ain't never, never, never gonna stop
You better be careful, 'cause every single time you'll see me drop
I'm comin' to get 'em and celebrate it, cop another yacht
Be fuckin' shit up, is you wit' me? (Let's go)
You know I got it for ya 'cause you need that
I make 'em scream a line until you hear a lot of feedback
And then I hit the block until the shit is off the meat rack
Funny, Calvin, they want you to bring the beat back (Let's go)
Look, you don't really wanna do it (Heh-eh)
Go against me never, I be flowin' like a fluid
And I be damagin' everything every time when I really get up on it
It's nothin' we know, and they already knew it
And it ain't nothin' really to it 'cause we 'bout to let it blow (Blow)
Fireworks, people, now we givin' 'em a show
Never chill, gotta know a lot of money on the flo'
If it ain't nothin' else, you gotta let 'em know, are you ready or not?

Bang, everybody, if you step up in the party
And we do it, are you ready or not?
Flyin' like a rocket, ain't nobody else can stop it
I'll be movin', are you ready or not?
Watch the way we kill 'em and you know we gonna get 'em
And hit 'em then, are you ready or not?
Tell me if you're ready or not
Show me if you're really ready or not

Step up in the spot like another block
Every time I drop, stop, they ain't even got a clue (Clue)
Regularly trust I really need to be seen (Seen)
Medically tell me what you really wanna do
Generally, others think they better than me, boo (Boo)
'Til they try to squeeze they little foot up in my shoe
That's when I make 'em panic, I don't really understand it (Eh-eh)
That's when I lay 'em down and try to get a better view (View)
Genuinely see the way I regularly chew (Chew)
Wack all 'em bitch, I'm from the legendary few (Few)
Some are frumpin', I don't know if they already knew (Uh)
Instead of tryna front, you need to get a better crew (Uh huh)
Lactose, bitch, I keep a MAC close
Better know I pack toast, I don't wanna let it go (Ooh)
Damn folks, now they wanna stand close
Every time I bang, those cannons and they blow, are you ready or not?

Bang, everybody, if you step up in the party
And we do it, are you ready or not?
Flyin' like a rocket, ain't nobody else can stop it
I'll be movin', are you ready or not?

Lying in the grass
Watching the stars come out

Come and get the dream, ghosts right through the cemetery
Feel the morning rain, dancing 'round the Colosseum
I can not explain, something in your chemistry
Power to your brain, power to the mind's museum
Come and get the dream, ghosts right through the cemetery
Feel the morning rain, dancing 'round the Colosseum
I can not explain, something in your chemistry
Power to your brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain

We can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
We can watch the stars come out

4 ContributorsThe Rain Lyrics
She's the type of girl that makes you feel better
It don't matter how you used to feel
She's the kinda girl that follows good weather
And the sun brings out her sex appeal

If you want to talk to her, it don't matter
You'll be breathless when she calls your name
Oh, I'll bet that you can hear the rain

These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright

How do you think I can make you feel better?
How do I know what you say is real?
Writing an imaginary love letter
Talking mostly 'bout her sex appeal

If you want to talk to her, it don't matter
You'll be breathless when she calls your name
Oh, I'll bet that you can hear the rain

These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life

5 ContributorsWorst Day Lyrics
Must be the worst day of my life
Izza Kizza, girl

My first mistake was letting you into my life
Yes, it was
My second mistake was allowing you into my bed
Laying in my bed
My third mistake was loving you more than I should
Though I really should know better
My fourth mistake was sitting with you
While you're telling me that you can't do this anymore

This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

I'm walking home and listening to MP3s
Just how did I let you decide to destroy me?
I'm missing you, it crossed my mind that a heart will bleed
The love that I have left behind is gonna finish me
It's one of those days

This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
('Cause it's the worst day of my life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
(Girl, Izza Kizza)
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

See, yesterday, I called her back
The day before, I called her flat
It ain't working, break my neck
Still, it ain't cut me my cheque
A week ago, I did my thing
Three o' clock, I missed my train
Tomorrow, I thought we could chill
There won't be us, you won't, I will
The moral of the story like I told my cousin Corey
You see, Cupid, he will stab you in the back like Jason Voorhees
So he's got smoking me cigarettes and got me drinkin' 40s
And the doctor said, "Take two of these
And call me in the morning"
It's the worst day

This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

Yeah, writing's on the wall
Got no heart, no soul, no control

This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life

Longing for the night to feel that moment the spark hits
Pullin' me to places I don't know

And it's the same as it all was
Middle of the street while all the cars drive around us
Takin' me to places I don't know
I know you're here, but not for long, oh, no

My dreams keep repeatin'
They keep you from leavin'
They don't let me wake up alone
(My dreams)

It's a tainted reflection, punchin' in the sheets
You know I crave the attention
All that I can have, I want the most
I know you're here, but not for long, oh, no, love

My dreams keep repeatin'
They keep you from leavin'
They don't let me wake up alone

Would you just like to tell us
How you began creating disco?

Well, it was the mid 70's
I was a virtually unknown producer at the time
And I, I was conducting various sonic experiments
With the assistance of Mary, my wife

Anyway, during one session I discovered that
By using a succession of techniques
I, I actually developed during the war
I could create an entirely new genre of music
And that was the night I created disco

I created disco

Would you just like to tell us
How you began creating
Disco, disco, disco, disco, disco?

Inside me, inside me is a flame
That burned brighter anytime you came
Gets in the way when I'm alone with you
But disappears if I'm with someone new

It learnt how to fit into my foreplay

Until the night when we were on the phone
You're moving on, oh, I'm better (Ow)

I can't believe it, every day and every night (Bounce)
Is gettin' better with you out of my life (Bounce)
It's like I flicked a switch, and now I'm feeling good (Bounce)
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes, I know I feel alive (Bounce)
You will be the last thing on my mind (Bounce)
No regrets, do you know what that means? (means, means)


Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
I can love again tonight
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back (back, bac)


Bounce


I feel so close to you right now, it's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve like a big deal
Your love pours down on me, surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now


I feel so close to you right now, it's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve like a big deal
Your love pours down on me, surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now


And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now


Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine-mine)

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


We took it all apart, but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room, something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day


You could see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts


Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day


I love the way I feel
Streets replaced with fields
Wide awake in here, you shine
I ran away from goals
Left you in the cold
Nothing's in our way tonight

You know that you'll never be replaced
And everyone here made the same mistakes as me
And either way, our time won't go to waste
Our﻿ hearts will never be the same again
Our hearts will never be the same again


Our hearts will never be the same again


I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love


I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there, but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love


Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles, but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this, but I know I'm not that strong

And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love (love, love)


All the years, all the times
You were never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears, all the lies, all the waste
I've been trying to make it change
And now my eyes are open

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free


I-I-I-I-I-I-I could pay for everything that's on you (Yeah)
So everything is on me (Woo)
Got them girls going Cyndi Lauper
Gaga and a little Blondie
If you ain't drunk, then you in the wrong club
Don't feel sexy? You're on the wrong beach
Tell the bar that we don't want no glass, just bottles
And I'm buying everybody one each

Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old and something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle

Yeah, I was done with staying, getting it wrong (Yeah)
Then everything is alright (Woo)
Got them girls going Heidi Klum
The Kardashians, Rihanna, all types

If you ain't high, then you're not on my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need no sparklers or nothin'
Just keep the bottles coming all night

Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot

You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushin' out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So, I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'


It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So, I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'


And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing (Woah, woah, woah)
Nothing

If I told you that this couldn't get better, baby
And your heartbeat, it lets me know you feel the same
I can hold you, keep you safe until you fall asleep
Never worried, 'cause I can give you what you need

Now everything I do is all for loving you
It's not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you every day
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose
I'll do anything you want me to
Like any other day, I know I'll find a way
And if ever I'm alone, you'll say

In a moment, I know that everything could change
And I know that my life would never be the same
But you're the only one that's making sense to me
When I close my eyes, you're the one I see
There's no other way I could ever be without you, babe

Now everything I do is all for loving you
It's not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you every day
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose

But the temperature rising, a fire is flickering
Getting hotter and hotter, beyond the wildest dreams
I'm connected to Heaven cause this is everything

Can you feel the waking sun?

Where we can touch the sun
We're closer now with every touch
We burn it up, you light me up
And we could touch the sun

And we could touch the sun
And we could touch the sun
And we could touch the sun
And we could touch the sun

Every moment here with you is a candle flame
Going out of control, it's more than I can take
I can feel it ignited from 
Like an ocean of energy, and we wash the wave

Can you feel the waking sun?
Rising up, the two of us
Where we can touch the sun

We burn it up, you light me up
And we could touch the sun

You took my heart and you had it in your mouth
And, with the word all my love came rushing out
And, every whisper, it's the worst, empty though by a single word
There is a hollow on me now (me now, me now)

So, I'll put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing


It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I swallow every single word
And every whisper, every sigh, eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow on me now (me now, me now)

So, I'll put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing


And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing (Woah, woah, woah)

I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love
Now I'm dreaming, will I ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so hopeless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love
All the years
All the times
You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears
All the lies
All the waste
I've been trying to make a change
And now my eyes are open

I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free

Soon as the stooly sings
And it wasn't cause she couldn't control us
Look, i'm back like niggas on a bus
Oh i see you couldn't stop, it wasn't your fault, you couldn't restrain/
Who do you blame? it's a shame because the man's slain
Fuck it turn my mic up a lil bit
Too much greatness, you couldn't even grasp it
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
But still couldn't find any hope crevice
And i don't run counters no more
Couldn't find a thing worth fighting for,I couldn't imagine what would happen
She smiles; a niggas full of passion
I'm done thinking, this ain't enough drinking
Couldn't keep sleeping, but kept thinking

And blame God for looking too old?
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold?
You can untrain yourself to notice

Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door

I am literally in a state of reverse brainwashing
To become a clear, bright, purified channel of the most high
Might take a lifetime of work and you know what?
I'm in, can you dig it?
So I'm gonna ask you to join me on this journey into your
Your awesomeness, you know what I'm sayin'?

Ushuaïa, how we feelin'?


Sometimes, I feel like throwin' my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes, I feel like sayin', "Lord, I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me through
Sometimes, it seems the goin' is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then, it seems like life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through

When food is gone, you are my daily need, oh
When friends are gone, I know my savior's love is real
You know it's real

You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love

But I've gotta let it go

And we'rе standing side by side

My flow is nasty like tofu
Have you sitting on clouds like a young Goku
Dope niggas locked out four year rap trotted
The sun is now gone
See dark clouds coming out
Boozy Brandy and Bacardi Beverages

But something was always missing like 6Dz
I step through the stomach
Replace the baby with some looking pounds
You shouldn't look back to the past in fact just look up in the clouds
But five years from now I bet she see

Ripping holes in clouds as my altitude diminishes
How I do it thinking I'm new to this
In the clouds where I sit off another spliff
Vicious viscous clouds your flow
Victory is my impulse


One look at the clouds
Do you see me?
Addicted to the hobby of making rap writings

No dark clouds
Just silver linings

And you lose your rhythm, don't give up the fight
When you wake up in the morning
Darling, I'll be by your side

I'll be there by your side
If you need a light that's shining

Does your heart bleed like mine?
(Oh does your heart, yeah)
For a place we can go
Where the troubles of our time are far away
(Hey they're so far awa-ay)
And I had all my life in front of me
Now my darkness days are trouble-free
There are so many wondrous things for you to see
If you find that something's going wrong
Look around at what you're running from
You can wait a thousand years in line
For that stillness in time
I found love in that way
And I'm never sad, and I'm always glad
Anything you give me today
I will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
'Cos they don't know where they're coming from
There was nothing left to do but hang on
For a stillness in time
(For a stillness in time
Search the spaces on my mind)
If this world is turning too fast for your head
Just remember how bad times can roll instead
Guess I'll have to search the spaces on my mind
For a stillness in time
You can wait a thousand years in line
For that stillness in time
I found love in that way
And I'm never sad, and I'm always glad
Anything you give me today

I can't believe it, every day and every night (Bounce)
Is gettin' better with you out of my life (Bounce)
It's like I flicked a switch, and now I'm feeling good (Bounce)
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes, I know I feel alive (Bounce)
You will be the last thing on my mind (Bounce)
No regrets, do you know what that means?


Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
I can love again tonight
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the slide (Oh yeah)
Whatever comes, comes through clear (Yeah)
Do you slide on all your nights like this? (Yeah)
Do you try on all your nights like this? (Your nights, oh)
Put some spotlight on the side (Light on)
And whatever comes, comes through clear (Yeah)

I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (Uh)

All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Layin', we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

[Song 142: We’ll Be Coming Back (Original Extended Mix)]
6 ContributorsWe’ll Be Coming Back (Original Extended Mix) Lyrics
We took it all apart, but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room, something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day


You could see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I cravе
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are wе ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts

Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

3 ContributorsFeel So Close / Last Night (TWINSICK Edit)  Lyrics
Last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life, goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

I know that last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

No way it was our last night (Last night)

I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes, you feel so cold, you know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waitin' for the fire to light
Feelin' like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control


We're under control

I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes, you feel so cold, you know
I'm too afraid of my hеart to let you go

Waitin' for the fire to light
Feelin' likе we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road

[Song 146: I’m Not Alone (Extended Mix)]
4 ContributorsI’m Not Alone (Extended Mix) Lyrics
Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old?
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold?
You can untrain yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
'Til next year?

God, I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone


If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I'm not alone?
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I'm not alone? No


If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I'm not alone?
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I'm not alone? No

I want you to hold me
Don't let me go
Be the one and only
Take all control

Stay with me forever
At least for the night
Even when you leave me, lead me to the light

You are my desire, oh
And just the thought of you is keepin' me awake
You take me higher, oh
Take me away
You are my desire, oh
And just the thought of you is keepin' me awake
You take me higher, oh
Take me away

Take me away

Promise you won't wake me
Before you leave
Leave me in a daydream
Just you and me

Stay with me forever
At least for the night (The night)
Even when you leave me, lead me to the light

You are my desire, oh
And just the thought of you is keepin' me awake
You take me higher, oh
Take me away
You are my desire, oh
And just the thought of you is keepin' me awake
You take me higher, oh
Take me away
