We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I'll find
A real love

So I've tried my best and prayed to God he'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
I'll give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

Real love, I'm searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

See, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I'm searching for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
(Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love

Don’t it seem like
Like I’m always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time
A terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working
Made me an addict
There's way more people that want it
Than people that have it
I don't get it, I would hate to think I tricked ‘em
They fall victim to my system
Guess I sure know how to pick em
And I’m always her regret
Yeah, I’m always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
It goes up and down, it’s just up and down
She’s crying now but she’ll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
And expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she’s not the type to hold grudges
I’m wrong

Bad boys ain't no good
Good boys ain't no fun
Lord knows that I should
Run off with the right one, hey

Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (So good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (So bad)
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up 'cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

Hung up off your good
You call and I run
My family's screaming at me, "Don’t do it"
"Don't do it, Mary!"
I guess they never had none

Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (So good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (So bad)

Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on

When he put that loving on me, I can’t think of nothing
That’ll make me walk out
I’m holding on

I must be out my mind
For going so strong

Now I watch you play Columbo, Picasso
Tricks inside colossals, turn your castles to brothels, uh

Dippin' on your ninja Honda with Tanisha and Rhonda, what?
You work more body than Jane Fonda (Uh-uh)

Under pressure, I lie for you, die for you
Ruger by the thigh for you, right hand high for you
Because of you, I'm inheritin' trillions
Buryin' billions, Bentley coupes millions (And no one can tell me who)
Playin' good Samaritan in the Sheraton
Crack the Dom P's and Remy's, you better hurry in

Who's gonna make you feel the way I do? (Who gon' love you like I do? Huh? What? Who gon' treat you like I do? Huh? What? No one)
Nobody (Uh-huh, uh, nobody)

While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else

Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids, I have nothing to show
Wasted my years, a fool of a wife
I should have left your ass a long time ago

Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears (Can't do it)
Well, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it), I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears (You were never worth my tears)
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet

Eleven years I've sacrificed
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I should've left your ass a thousand times

Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
(I deserve better)
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
(Never gonna shed a tear, no)
Well, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it), I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
(I'm not gonna cry no more)
No, I'm not gon' cry (No, no, no, no), it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I know there are no guarantees (Guarantees)
In love, you take your chances (Don't take chances)
But somehow it seems unfair to me (So unfair)
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health, 'til death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our hearts
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet

Eleven years I've sacrificed
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I should have left your ass a thousand times

Well, I'm not gon' cry (Again, and again, and again), I'm not gon' cry
(I said I should've been gone, gone, gone, gone)
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No, I'm not gon' cry (I'm not gonna cry), it's not the time (It's not worth the time)
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well, I'm not gon' cry
(I'm not gonna shed a tear 'cause you lied)
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears (I'm not gonna cry)
No, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it)
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
(You were never worth my tears)

Well, I'm not gon' cry (No, I'm not gonna cry)
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears (All the tears I cried)
No, I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time (I'm not gonna shed a tear)
'Cause you're not worth my tears (But you're wrong)
Well, I'm not gon' cry (But you're wrong), I'm not gon' cry (You're wrong)
I'm not gon' shed no tears (I'm not gonna shed a tear)
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time

Somebody told me once that pain is a game we all gotta play
Then why am I in overtime and sudden death every other day
I know that for the good of life there's a price we all gotta pay
But I'll pay till I'm poor and I still don't know what it is to have a good day, yeah
Since everybody knows what it is that I need to do
Well do me a favor, let me worry bout me and you worry bout you

I don't need no one to put me down
I'm on the ground, can't get no lower
And I don't need no one to hang around and make me frown just makes me look older
And I don't need no one to black my eye and tell me lies
Don't wanna cry over nobody else
No no no no I can do bad all by myself

Somebody told me once that running from the rain don't make no sense
I had my own dark cloud for awhile now, it goes where ever I'm going, yeah
They're telling me the grass just might be greener on the other side
But I don't wanna take a chance on dirt when I got grass even though the grass has died
Oh since everybody knows what it is that I need to do
Well do me a favor, let me worry bout me and you worry bout you

I don't need no one to put me down
I'm on the ground, can't get no lower
And I don't need no one to hang around and make me frown just makes me look older
And I don't need no one to black my eye and tell me lies
Don't wanna cry over nobody else
No no no no I can do bad all by myself

Don't waste time feeling bad for me
I didn't ask you for your sympathy
No I know God is watching over me
So I guess this is where I'm suppose to be
Ohh yes

I don't need no one to put me down
I'm on the ground, can't get no lower
And I don't need no one to hang around and make me frown just makes me look older
And I don't need no one to black my eye and tell me lies
Don't wanna cry over nobody else
No no no no I can do bad all by myself

And to find a love that's mine (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

I asked for a sign
From my sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me, but when
You think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you
And you for me

Oh, I cannot hide the way I feel inside
(No, I don't know why)
I don't know why, but every day I wanna cry

To these rules, will you abide?

Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind
All the time?
Help me sing it

Must've been crazy to think that you loved me
I saw all the signs but I just couldn't say nothing
I did the time across the line for you
'Cause I can't see myself with nobody else but you
Tell me what you're thinking 'cause this is what you wanted
Should've been the one to hold me when I got lonely
'Cause every time I think of the lies you told to me
Make it easy for me to leave

You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me

Oh, I was ridin' wherever you going
At times, I wanted to leave, but didn't wanna be lonely
Can't deny the fact you were my one and only
Love that I would do, only love I knew
And now I gotta turn my back 'cause you didn't realize that, boy
This was a real thing
And I just can't deny the fact we don't belong together
Guess it ain't the real thing

You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me

Gotta keep on pushing and love myself through the hard times
Gotta keep my patience, still a long way to go now
There's so much to learn
When we trust the love that's deep in us
Then love will return (yes, it will)
Boy this thing was, a love lesson

You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me

It's been a long ride, but I made it here with love
I made it here with love, love
Said I've been and up and down and I've been through it all
Took a while to know my heart
Oh, yes, it has, yeah
Before a love like this, you go
Through the fire and valley lows
But if you just hold on
Please hold on 'cause love is strong, it'll save ya
Oh, please hold on, it'll save ya, save ya

Truth can be the sweetest pain
It can mess up everything
It's the only way you know
I'm payin' for it, I'm changin' for it
Oh, oh, and it hurts
But I'll make it work
'Cause I'm no beginner
I'm a winner, paid dues, I know my purpose

Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds, I'm movin' past you

Oh, you gotta love yourself
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else

Yeah, gotta love yourself
Uh, you know what I'm sayin'?

I decided not to use my color as a handicap
He a designer, artist, producer, and he rap
Never found virtue from patience, in a dark room just pacin'
Precious time is just wastin', you do not know what we facin'
I cannot be complacent, in my job, be courageous
Another kid just got shot, they can't find the assailant
Made it out of the basement, made it out of the underground
From a time where you outta town, they might gun you down, blaow
There goes another round, blaow, there goes another round (another round)
Came from this Chi and wow, look what the fuck they found
A young legend, comin' to shut the summer down (summer down)
You need to talk to me like you don't bring your mother 'round (your mother 'round)

Oh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else

I don't feel no ways tired
Can't get restless in my soul
Hold your heart, the world is cold
Keep singin', don't you stop prayin', woman
Yeah, it will come to pass
Don't worry 'bout nothin'
God knows that you're worth it
You deserve it, can't nothin' else hurt you

Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds are movin' past you

Oh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else

Cuz I ain't no quitter babe
And I be damned if all these years I let you diss me, babe

You know I deserve more than this

No more crying and trying
And bring back this loving when nothing is here

But this shit ain't worth it
I’m done with the mess
I confess on the stress
And I know Ima look back and call it a blessing
Cuz I ain't no quitter babe

It's too bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too bad, baby
But I gotta face reality
It's too bad, it's too bad
Too bad, baby
But I gotta face reality

Today you had a visitor, or should I say an old friend
But wait a minute, that's not where it ends, no
Is there something that you wanna tell me?
Mmm, 'cause I'm believing what your friends say
About your hidden secrecies

And girlfriend, she wasn't disrespectful
(In fact) She's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours?

She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious

She said she never wanted to hurt me
And could I understand, she's afraid and lost
She said a real woman wouldn't do this over the phone
And that you told her about me after the baby was born

And girlfriend, she wasn't disrespectful
(In fact) She's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours?

She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
(Really messed me up)
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious
(She said) She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
(There can never be anymore us)
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious (so precious)

Oh, the baby looks just like you
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Your own child
What kind of man are you?

And girlfriend, she wasn't disrespectful
(In fact) She's a hundred percent sure
Oh, and how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours?

She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious
She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?

'Cause the sex was good, you had my mind
And I let you come back every time
You would violate and cross the line
And you knew that I would be the type to
Always wait so patiently, thinkin'
You was comin' home to me
Well, damn, I never heard the keys
Or felt your taps sayin', "Are you asleep?"
Rewind that

Well, damn, I never heard the keys
Or felt your taps sayin', "Are you asleep?"

Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me

Time I choose my clothes
Choose my friends, be with my family
They been askin' "Girlfriend, where you been?"
We ain't seen you in weeks
Been chasin' this fool around
Thinkin' he gon' hold me down
I would follow his lead
Thinkin' I would be the one he keep around
When I ain't need it, not your finance
And all that I needed, real commitment
I really couldn't see it, not the real man
You said you would be in this relationship
So many men think (These men)
That all a girl needs (They think)
Is to be sold a dream (A dream)
But I won't fall for it

Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me

Don't wanna play house no more
You treat me all wrong, tired of you playin' me
I been lookin' at the front door
This ain't yours so let me come in
Don't wanna play house no more
No more, I'm tired of you playin' me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin'
It's time I do something for me

You turned your back, and back I came running
But the simple fact is that you ain't want me
Done enough lying and crying to myself
Nothing left to do but move
What else can I do but leave?
I believed that you would marry me, but now I gotta breeze
I be's with LT when you come to your senses
But then it's too late
That's always how it be
Catch me with the B's on the wheels, Giuseppe's on the hills
Shoulda Marc Jacob Fe Fe bagged me when you had me
Next dude will gladly pick up where you left off
Ice me, wife me, you ain't gonna have me

Cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me
Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
(To think that you would marry me)
I got to be out my mind to think
I need someone to carry me

Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')

I know you can hear me now
For the record: I love you, I love you
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record: I love you, I love you

When I found out that you were leaving me
I couldn't sleep thinking about
All the things that we've been through
Now all I want to do is tell you
That I miss you so much
You know I really really miss you

To those pretty memories

For the record: I love you, I love you

Now that I'm on my own
I know that in time, I'll find somebody new
(Who'll treat me better than you)
So now that I'm all alone without you
But I still love you (Love you)
You know I'll never live without you

All those pretty memories

I wish you'd change your ways soon enough
So we can be together
You just don't understand good love
But now all we have is memories

15 ContributorsOne Lyrics
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now
You got someone to blame?
You say one love, one life (One life)
It's one need in the night (In the night)
One love (One love), we get to share it (Oh)
Leaves you darlin', if you don't care for it
Mary

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without?
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

One, one
One, one
One, one
One, one
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?
Well, did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
See, we hurt each other, then we do it again
You say love is a temple, love is a higher law
Love is a temple, love is a higher law
You ask for me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't keep holding on to what you've got
'Cause all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters and my brothers
One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

One, one
One, one
One, one
One love, one love

So tired, tired of this drama
You go your way, I go my way
No more, no more
I'd rather be free
So tired, tired, tired

Broken heart again
Another lesson learn
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burned
Gotta count on me
'Cause I can guarantee that I'll be fine

(No more pain)
No more pain
(No more pain)
No more pain
(No drama)
No more drama in my life
(No more in my life) No one's gonna make me hurt again

Why'd I play the fool?
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
'Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

(No more pain) No more pain, no more pain
(No more) No more game
No more game messin' with my mind (No drama)
No more drama in my life (No more in my life)
No one's gonna make me hurt again
No more (No more tears)
No more tears, I'm tired of cryin' every night
(No more fears) No more fears, I really don't wanna cry
(No drama) No more drama in my life (No more in my life)
I don't ever wanna hurt again
Wanna speak my mind, wanna speak my mind
Go 'head

Ooh, it feels so good
When you let go
Of all the drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain (Free from all the pain)
Free from all the game (Free from all the game)
Free from all the stress (Free from all the stress)
So find your happiness
I don't know
Only God knows where the story ends for me
But I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or lose
And I choose to win

(No more pain) No more pain, no more pain, tired of hurting
(No more pain) Tired of your playin' games with my mind
(No drama) No more drama in my life (No more in my life)
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
(No more tears) No more tears, no more cryin' every night
(No more fears) No more waking me up in the morning
With your disturbing phone calls (No drama)
Leave me alone, go ahead (No more in my life)
Hey, yeah, oh, whoa (No more pain)
No more time (No more games)
No more games, I'm tired, I'm so tired (No drama)
No more, no more (No more in my life)
No more, no more
No more, no more, no more

No more drama
I'm tired of all this drama (No more drama)
Go 'head, go 'head
You demons get out of my face (No more drama)
Go get out my life (No more drama)
I am 'bout to lose my mind
Lord, help me, help me say
No more drama (No more drama)
No more drama
No more drama (No more drama)
No more drama
Oh, help me sing, I need a peace of mind
No more drama (Peace of mind, peace of mind)
Yeah, I need a good night sleep (No more drama)
I need to know that you won't creep

Oh no, oh no
No more, no more, no more drama
No more drama in my, in my life
I'm so tired (I'm so tired, so tired)
Tired, tired of all this drama
Of all the drama

You should know better
I tell myself
You’ll never go further
I warned myself
You’ll never be better
Don’t know me that well

I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I’d do it all again
Cause I made it to the top
But I can’t keep doubting myself anymore
No, ooh, oh, oh

No, ooh, oh, oh

You think you know
But you don’t know the half
You think you beat me down
But I’ll have the last laugh
I’ll keep getting up
Cause that’s what I want to do
I’m gonna be the best me
I’m sorry if it kills you

I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I’d do it all again
Cause I made it to the top
I can’t keep doubting myself anymore
Oooh, no, ooh, no, no, no
I can’t keep doubting myself , no, no

And I remember holding The Breakthrough album
Holding it in my hands, in my car

To just be, like me
I feel like we're, we're so similar

She's been talked about constantly
She's been up and down
She's been pushed around
But they held her down, NYC
She has no regrets
She accepts the past
All these things they helped to make she
She's been lost and found
And she's still around
There's a reason for everything (Yeah)

You know I've been holding on
Try to make me weak but I still stay strong
Put my life all up in these songs
Just so you can feel me
So you can get the real me

So take me as I am (Take me as I am)
Or have nothing at all (Nothing at all)
Just take me as I am
Or have nothing at all (Nothing at all)

Yes, she's older now
Yes, she's wiser now
Can't disguise her now
She don't need no one tellin' her
What to do and say
No one tellin' her who to be
She's on solid ground
She's been lost and found
Now she answers to G-O-D
And she's confident this is not the end
Ask me how I know 'cause she is me (Yeah)

You know I've been holdin' on (I've been holdin' on)
Try to make me weak but I still stay strong (Stay strong)
Put my life all up in these songs
Just so you can feel me
So you can get the real me

So take me as I am
Or have nothing at all (At all)
Just take me as I am (As I am)
Or have nothing (Or nothing, baby) at all (This is me, this is me)

So it's all or nothing at all

Hey, yo, yo, Pop, check out that situation right there, yo
Yeah, what's the motions, man?
Yo, honey right there, yo
Yo, the fine amazon, man?
Yeah, yeah, she got it goin' on and on like, you know?

Ay, yo, I got it goin' on, hun

What's the 411, hun?
I got it goin' on hun
Ay, yo, I got it goin' on, hun

Well, I be Puba on this here, the nigga from last year
Girbauds hangin' baggy, Tommy Hilfiger top gear
Take no shorts, I'm doin' lovely in all sports
Even swing the pole at the hole on my golf course
Some say I'm fair, see, 'cause I'm horny and nasty
If I see some rugged joints, then I won't let it pass me
I take no shorts, let suckers step up to see
I'll flip the script, and get harder than Jeopardy
I shot the sheriff and the mutherfuckin' deputy, test me, check it
I'm not Keith Sweat, but bet that ass that I can make it last
Skinz turn their head so fast, they end up catchin' whiplash
If hun's a monster, I'm Carl Lewis on the meter dash
It's Grand Puba, baby, and I'm gettin' crazy cash
What's the 411? Let me know, hun
What's the 411?

What's the 411, hun?
What's the 411, hun?
I got it goin' on
Ay, yo, I got it goin' on, hun
Ay, yo, what's the 411, hun?
What's the 411, hun?
I said I got it goin' on
Ay, yo, I got it goin' on

Yeah, nigga, what makes ya different from the next nigga?
Seen ya last week, and ya couldn't even speak
Ya try ta play like Mr. All Of That
But now ya wanna come to me with some chitchat?
I don't have no time for no 'Wam-bam-thank-you-ma'am'
Gas me up, get me drunk and hit the skins and scram
The same ol' shit you pulled last week on Pam
I'm not havin' that, no, I'm not havin' that
Ya gotta do a lot more, and that's just how it be
I'm Mary Blige and you just ain't runnin' up in me
I need a man whose lookin' out with some security
So come correct with some respect, and then we will see
So if you wit' it, then drop the seven digits
And I might just give you a call
If you ain't wit' it, then don't waste your time at all
So what's the 411, hun?

Hey, yo, honey was talkin' a little somethin', man
Yo, so what's up? Push up, man
I'm gonna catch up with it in a minute
Right now, see what she talkin' about
So set it straight, man
Aight, yo, I'll get back wit' ya lata, G
Chill

All my love is all I have
And Grand Puba's very special
All my life I look for you
And today your dream comes true
You need me and I need you
Grand Puba is very special
Things just seem to do divine
This is how the two combine
I know our love was meant to be
Mary Blige is somethin' kinda special
Love is life and life is livin'! You're very special
You know it, baby, you got it goin' on a little somethin'
So baby, you know what I'm sayin'?
A little time, spend a little time

Bounce on her for another day, man

[Song 31: Set Me Free]
11 ContributorsSet Me Free Lyrics
Tell me how you figure that you made me
And you gave me what I had before I meet ya
Ain't gon' have it when you're gone
And how you fix your mouth to say I owe you
When you had another bitch and taking trips and shit
With my money for so long
You must have lost it, nigga, you won't get a dime
But all you're gonna get, too bad, I can't get back my time
Wasted all this time
I'ma be alright, be just fine, woo

There's a special place in hell for you
You gon' pay for what you did to me
I'ma tell you, 'cause the truth will see me free, oh

Yes, I cut that bitch 'cause things was running through my brain
And what I found out 'bout you was enough to go insane
All this time to think that you were just here for my name
I was loving you and you were only playing games
Oh, what a damn shame

There's a special place in hell for you
You gon' pay for what you did to me
I'ma tell you, 'cause the truth will see me free, oh

Oh, I spent so many hopeless nights
Thinking you were really there
Thinking you would come home
Maybe that you care
But I'm wrong again
You never were my friend
All alone
Now I'm finally free to be me, yeah, yeah
Oh, woah, yeah, ooh

There's a special place in hell for you
You gon' pay for what you did to me
I'ma tell you 'cause the truth will see me free, oh

Gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya
Gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, oh
If I keep it in, it'll drive me crazy
So thank you, thank you for listening
Thank you for pulling me through

[Song 32: MJB Da MVP]
19 ContributorsMJB Da MVP Lyrics
Yeah, let's take 'em back

'91, I stepped in this game
After "What's the 411?" things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain, but
I'm so glad to be here and my music's still sincere
Let's get back to the story of all this pain and glory
And '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I've been through

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

Then I came with "Share My World"
But at that point I was just a foolish girl trying to find my way
Then I dropped the Mary album
And people were saying that it's just not gonna work
And my feelings, they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
Then I came with "No More Drama", I remember that week
Yeah, it was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it every day and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

You remind me of a real love (You don't have to worry)
Real love
All night long I'm goin' down
Reminisce on the love we have
You are everything, love without a limit
What you gonna do without my life, my life, my life, my life?

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top (Hate it or love it)
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
(I'm gon' shine right now)
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it (I'm gon', I'm gon' shine)
I'm gon' shine (I'm gon', I'm gon' shine)
Go 'head, envy me (Hey, hey), I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

Right now I wanna thank
Each and every person out there that's ever done anything for Mary J. Blige
I wanna thank TV, radio, talk shows, friends, family
But most of all I wanna thank my fans
For hanging in there with me during the bad times
And now you're here
To see me at a point in my life where I can actually call myself a queen
And for those of you that don't like it
This is what you can do
You can do this
You can hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it (Hate it)
Hate it or love it (Love it)
Hate it or love it (Hey, yeah)
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it

Samples Diddy-Dirty Money’s song from Last Train to Paris – Someone To Love Me
It then features Diddy himself and Lil Wayne.
(It's a shame that y'all put me in such a box... Check it!)
Ayo Mary, I want you to talk to em like you supposed to
Come on

Looking for someone to love me
I’m-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

I’m no angel, there's so much I can take
Calm down, patience, don’t lose your temper, hold on, wait
I’ve got issues just like you, sometimes I get so confused
I’m strong but I can break, I be prayin so hard to get thru the day
Bad thoughts in my mind I can’t shake
Having nightmares in the day can you relate?
Please somebody calmly wake me
I can’t let this cold world take me, I was looking

My drama, my karma
My love, my life, dear momma
The war’s I’ve fought, scars that I’ve garnered
The hustle, I got that honest from my father
Mix me with violence, blend me with peace
Combine me with hate and I can’t face defeat (nope)
I did it all in a week
Still incomplete as I stand on my feet
It take a lot to still dance to the beat
Skin more cold and callous than concrete
I love swimming but there's just one ski
In a rich man’s chique hotel with bed sheets
Uh ah, you know what I’m looking for

Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

It’s my life, my life, word to Mary
Niggas can’t fuck with me, Virgin Mary
Go ahead make my day, dirty Harry
Weezy, fuck the world, pop the cherry
Everybody pushing but I don’t fall back
And everybody looking but blind to the fact
The clock on the wall say it’s time for some action
Now you can take that to the bank and cash in
I’m feeling myself, fuck if they feeling me
Can’t spell them without me, it's them or me
Yesterday was a memory
Looking in the mirror at my enemy
But today I’m...

Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

My rise, my falls, enemies wanna see me crawl
My ups, my downs, y'all know I’ve been around
But sometimes it bothers me when I hear people say a non truth
Am I sane, am I crazy, pick one there all the same
In this world we’re living in, I’ma make mistakes, I’m only human
I was...

Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

You told me a thousand times that you would be mine, all mine
I do everything for you, but in your smile, I still can’t find
Now you tell me this, this is something that I can miss
And all you wanna do is to love me for me and I'll love you for you

If lovin’ you is all that I have to do

And let me in where I belong
If lovin' you was all that I have to do
Then it won’t be wrong, baby
'Cause we belong together baby

Together, we will be as one
Just me and you, you, you, you
Will you love me? (I will love you)
Will you please me? (I will please you)
Girl, don’t leave me (I won’t leave you)
Let's make it easy (I’ll make it easy)

If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
I don’t wanna do anything else

They could take my possessions
They could never take your love away from me
Ohh, see now listen with every breath I breathe and every beat of my heart
I know that no one, I know that no one can tear us apart
'Cause I love you, baby
I love you too
And I need you
I need you too
Stay with me, more than just a day
And you know, you know, you know

[Song 38: Seven Days]
8 ContributorsSeven Days Lyrics
Oh, oh-oh

I've been searching for someone
But never looked before my eyes
There you were to my surprise
It was so obvious looking into your face
After playing a game of truth or dare
I wanted to stay at your place

I never thought that I would fall in love with you
But since the day we kissed, I knew it had to be you
I never thought we would be together
I can't believe I just made love to you
After all the things that we've been through
Now what are we gonna do? Oh

Monday, a friend of mine, Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away, Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back, I wanted to kiss you on Saturday
On Sunday, we made love, now what are we gonna do?

As much as I, I want you
I don't wanna wreck a friend I've already found in you
I've been there before, and I can't ignore
How two friends became one, but walked away with none

I cannot risk a friend, but the love is so good
I gotta make a choice, I would if I could
I never thought we would be together, how can I address you?
"Hey, lover?" "Hi, friend?" "How ya doin'?" "Where ya been?"
I gotta make a choice

Monday, a friend of mine (A friend of mine), Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away, Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back, I wanted to kiss you on Saturday

9 ContributorsWhole Damn Year LyricsIn this song, Mary J focuses in on the emotions associated with the recovery period after a breakup. However, the impact of the past breakup is increased when she confronts her new man.
Tryna find a way to explain this
Why you can't touch me tonight
I can feel you gettin' impatient
But I really can't let you inside
Bad, how deep the pain is
Ooh, you just couldn't believe
And yeah I seem good on the surface
But I'm a mess, I'm a mess underneath

See, winter took most of my heart
And spring punched me right in the stomach
Summer came lookin' for blood
And by autumn I was left with nothin'

It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It took a whole damn year
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It's been a bad five years
Gon' take a long, long year for me to trust somebody
Gon' take a long, long year
Gon' take a long, long year for me to touch somebody
It's been a bad five years

Not tryna do this on purpose
Boy, I really wish I could
Don't act like you never heard this
I know you haven't misunderstood
But the others just wouldn't respect it
Don't tell me you as well
I thought we were headed for Heaven
But you're 'bout to take me back to Hell

See, winter took most of my heart
And spring punched me right in the stomach
Summer came lookin' for blood
And by autumn I was left with nothin'

It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It took a whole damn year
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It's been a bad five years
Gon' take a long, long year for me to trust somebody
Gon' take a long, long year
Gon' take a long, long year for me to touch somebody
It's been a bad five years
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It took a whole damn year
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It's been a bad five years
Gon' take a long, long year for me to trust somebody
Gon' take a long, long year
Gon' take a long, long year for me to touch somebody
It's been a bad five years

Bad to the liver, bad to the bone
Bad to the liver, bad to the bone
Bad to the liver, bad to the bone
It's been a bad five years

Oh, oh (Turn up, turn the music up)
(You know that I don't ever wanna leave you)
I wanna be with you
(Does he care for you? Does he want you?)
I wanna be with you
(Does he even care?)

I can't deal with the fact that
You don't want me around
Why you wanna see me down?
It's so unusual
That you don't love me no more
Why you wanna close the door?

I spent all my days and all my nights with you
Just tell me what am I gonna do without you
If loving you is so right
Tell me how I'll make it through the night
(You know that I don't ever wanna leave you)

Nothing else I'd rather do

I want to spend my life with you, yeah, oh

Let's take this time to think about
What was said and done
Now tell me why you had to run
Away from me
Now I can't sleep at night
Why we have to fight?

Every day from you, I look and I see something new
Now tell me what I got to do to get this through to you
It's the little things you do for me
That make me very happy
You know that I don't wanna leave you

I, I, I (I wanna be with you)
I just wanna be with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do

You don't want me there
And it's beginning to make me so scared

All I wanna do is be with you baby, baby, baby, baby boy

So, you think you know how to love a woman?
Well, I feel it's still some things you need to know, things you need to know

A woman, she needs more than material things
And a woman needs so much more that what a man can say
A woman, needs you to make love to her, she needs more than sex
A real woman needs a real man that don't talk about it
Be about it
Put that work, and still shows his woman real romance

So, you think you know how to love a woman? (Think you know how to love her, yeah)
Well, I think it's still some things you need to know

A woman, she likes to talk and work it out
And a woman likes for you to watch her back
Protect her crown
A woman don't only want your make-up sex
She wants your respect
And a real woman never wanna walk into a room
See another woman knowing information
She don't even know about her man

So you think you know how to love a woman?

Well, I feel it's still some things you need to know, (Things you need to know)

Make your way home at a decent hour every night
Pick up your phone
Just to say you're still in love from time to time
Remind her that she's still beautiful in your eyes (Beautiful in your eyes)
And ride with your woman
Make her feel that you're always on her side
When she cries, ask her what she's feeling
Let her know you sympathize
Gotta swallow your pride (Your pride)
Got some making up to do, gotta make it right

Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Gotta take your time
I said kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Say it one more time, say it one more time (Whoo)
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Gotta take your time
Don't want a minute man
We wanna have fun until she finish, man
If that's asking too much
You'll never know how to really
Love a woman

So you think you know how to love a woman? (Oooh)
Well, I think it's still some things you need to know
(I think it's still some things, still some things you need to know, oh)

Hard enough to be alone
I'm just tryna move along (Mhm)
Sometimes, I do and, then, I don't
Tell me what I'm doing wrong
Tell myself that it ain't healthy
Second guessing, it don't help me
I'm so tired of feeling empty
Dry my eyes, it's time to fight
It seems like I'm always against me
Seems like this is never ending
And I refuse to let it end me

I need my peace (Yeah), yеs (Oh)

Life is a teacher, time is a healer
And I'm a believer like a river wild
Ego's a killer, greed is a monster
But love is stronger, stronger than them all

White flag in hand, I don't wanna fight
No lines in the sand, I'm on your side
Invisible, no colour life
It's time we put our, put our, put our differences aside

Time tells no lies
It keeps changing, and ticking, and moving, then passes by
But if you're lucky, it will be kind
Like a river flowing through time

(Like a river) let it wash you clean
(Mighty river) going up stream
(Like a river) cutting through right
(Mighty river) 'cause it never gives up
(Like a river) so full of life
(Mighty river) liquid like time
(Like a river) let it wash away
(Mighty river) the pain from yesterday

Love is the answer, hate is a cancer
Hope of forgiveness, it waters the soul
Our blood is red, we're not so different
'Cause underneath our skin we're identical

White flag in hand, we're not gonna fight
No lines in the sand, I'm on your side
Invisible, no colour life, oh
It's time we put our, oh, put our differences aside
We know wrong from right

Oh, time tells no lies
He keeps changing, and ticking, and moving, then passes by
But if you're lucky, it will be kind

I just want back what I put into this
And then, I'll keep movin'
All of my chips on the table
'Cause I never got what I came for
Not leaving 'til I am stable

I spent everything on ya
Spent my energy on ya
Put that loyalty on ya
I ain't got nothin' left
I'm in over my head (Woo!)
Now, I'm barely breathin'
You know you the reason, just tryna break even
You must be used to me spending

Look, now my rent money due
I spent everything fuckin' with you, oh
They said, "You win some, you win some, you lose"
All I got is rеnt money due, fuckin' with you

I just want back what I came with
Ain't no sеnse throwin' no shade
Pointing a finger in blame
I knew the risk, soon as we kissed
Wasn't no even exchange
You treat everyone like they are famous
Every girl like she's the main chick, amazing

I spent everything on ya
Spent my energy on ya
Put that loyalty on ya
I ain't got nothin' left
I'm in over my head (Woo!)
Now, I'm barely breathin'
You know you the reason, just tryna break even
You must be used to me spendin'

Look, now my rent money due
I spent everything fuckin' with you, oh
They say you win some, you win some, you lose
Now, all I got is rent money due, fuckin' with you

Goddamn, the rent money due
Tanqueray, spilling gin and juice, feeling like I'm Snoop
Phone out, she recording just so she can get the proof
It was all good when we was in the mood but I scratched that
Nothing on me regular, Louis Vuitton backpack
Shanks on, she ain't got her own, she gotta match that
Focused on the future, I don't backtrack
That rent money due, I take credit, cash, debit, even CashApp
Fifties, we spendin' hundreds, we stash that
It's hard to trust 'em, I one to stab that
Now I'm just looking past that
I hope you got your own, no more asking me where your cab at
Asking me what I'm mad at, smoke it and then, I pass that

What more do you want from me? (Want from me)
You can't help my sanity (No, no)
I gave you my best, there ain't nothing left
This can't be reality
I'm picking up the pieces of the puzzle here all by myself (Damn)
I can't even wish you well

Look, now my rent money due
I spent everything fuckin' with you, oh
They say you win some, you win some, you lose
All I got is rent money due, fuckin' with you

[Song 50: Feel Inside]
5 ContributorsFeel Inside Lyrics
Turn the track up a little bit
We need to rock in here
Oh, oh, oh
I wanna make you happy

I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite
It's my story, I'ma state it, you could love it or hate it
I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That's garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your bestie, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib
Mary...

I wanna make you happy
But you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe
But I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things
'Til we make each other cry
What are we doing?
Will it ever get better?

My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
Boy, I love you
But you're pushing me away

I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
I feel inside
This is how I feel, this is how I feel

Now I was hoping we'd get through this together
You said you'd love me through all types of stormy weather
Wasn't it you who said we'd be together for all time
But it keeps messing with my mind, oh oh

My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
I need you here near me
But I can't make you stay

I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
I feel inside
This is how I feel, this is how I feel

I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it?
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in

If you don't want this, I don't want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write back
Tell me why it's like that

So make up your mind, boy decide
We can't go on like this, this ain't right (It ain't right)
Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go, oh oh

I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
I feel inside
This is how I feel, this is how I feel

Sir Nas, Mrs. Mary J. Blige
And this is her life
Yeah, this is her life
Yeah, yeah yeah
This is how I feel, this is how I feel
Yeah
Let me hear that

I always wanted you to be my baby
When you touch me, boy, you drive me crazy
I don't wanna be your secret lover
When I get you, boy, there'll be no other

You and me it's gotta be (the real thing)
Diamond, gold, I'll set you free (my baby)
Wait too long, boy, I'll be gone (so hurry)
Wanna get this love don't do me wrong

What you find now (I think I love you)
What you feel now (I think I need you)
What you know now (to be real)

I get with you, boy, on one condition
If you promise not to ever mention
All the things we do to any of your friends
I will promise you love never ends

You and me it's gotta be (the real thing)
Diamond, gold, I'll set you free (my baby)
Wait too long, boy, I'll be gone (so hurry)
Wanna get this love don't do me wrong

What you find now (I think I love you)
What you feel now (I think I need you)
What you know now (to be real)

I pulled up to the front door of your love and I
Knock knocked and you opened up
Now you can't get enough, you was thinking one lil' date
Ate sushi wit ya soul mate
Dead the ice or the SUV's
Our love grows we chose to water the seeds
You the one I've fallen for the more we walk down love's corridor
The angels all applaud (I want ya)
See the look in my eyes don't ya
Like a kid in my whip with Willy Wonka
Like back in the day playin wit Tonka
Gimme ya palm, ma, lemme read ya fortune
I see trust with hard times and honesty
We gon' go down in history
One look in your face just prove the fact
That you don't have to chase what you can attract
Now what's real

What you find now (I think I love you)
What you feel now (I think I need you)
What you know now (to be real)
What you find now (got to be real)
What you feel now (got to be real)
What you know now (to be real)
What you find now
What you feel now
What you know now (to be real)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oooo (oh, oh, oh, oh) oooo
Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
'Cuz a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real shit (yes)
See baby we been...
Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cuz I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (no)
Make me cry? (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)
I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been...
Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cuz I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby
See this is real talk
I'm always stay (no matter what)
Good or bad (thick and thin)
Right or wrong (all day, every day)

Now if you're down on love or don't believe
This ain't for you (no, this ain't for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it's true (come on, come on, come on)
Well, let me see you put your hands up (hands up)
Fellas tell your lady she's the one (fellas tell your lady she's the one, oh)
Put your hands up (hands up)
Ladies let him know he's got your love
Look him right in his eyes and tell him
We've been...
Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cuz I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby
Heeeeeeeeeeeey ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
Heeeeeeeeeeeey ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you

[Song 53: Indestructible]
8 ContributorsIndestructible Lyrics
I know he hurt you after swearing that he would change
You're not the first to take him back again and again
And you ain't the first to cry, ain't the first one asking why
So you can't give up the fight, you never know when it's your time

Think about how valuable you are, you are, you are
Don't let what he put you through cause you to close your heart

I know your heart is aching, but you can't let him break it, baby
You gotta love like you never been hurt, to find a love that you deserve
Indestructible, indestructible
Indestructible, to find love you must be indestructible
Oh, you must be indestructible

I know it took you to a place where there was no love and he left you so numb
You're protecting your heart but girl, you need it, don't let him take away your feelings
Oh, so much to get over, you're feeling stuck but you wanna move forward
If you ready then love will find you, keep moving, don't look behind you

Think about how valuable you are, think about it, think about it, girl
Don't let what he put you through cause you to close your heart

I know your heart is aching, but you can't let him break it, baby
You gotta love like you never been hurt, to find a love that you deserve
Indestructible, indestructible
Indestructible, to find love you must be indestructible
You must be inde-inde-indestructible, oh yeah

You never know where love's gonna come
So you gotta be ready
I'm staying open
To the possibility that it's coming for me
You don't wanna end up in the place where you're not real
It would be so sad if you got to a place where you can't hear

Think about how valuable you are, think about it, think about it, girl
Don't let what he put you through cause you to close your heart, don't let him make you feel it

I know your heart is aching, but you can't let him break it, baby
You gotta love like you never been hurt, to find a love that you deserve
Indestructible, indestructible
Indestructible, to find love you must be indestructible

Don't let him break you down
Oh, you must be strong
You must be strong
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Oh, yeah

7 ContributorsDance For Me Lyrics
I come up in the dance with a slip of sensi
Whether peanuts, epitome too, or envy
A family affair, everything is carefree
I ain't get up off the wall until I heard Mary

If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me?
If you feelin' the groove, it ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor and just dance for me
And I know you been stressed, this whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor and just dance for me
'Cause we here, ain't no joke, so stay here 'til we're closed
And stay up on the floor and just dance for me

Hey, I know it's been rough
But I'm tryna make it easy
For everybody to dance for me

So come one, come all, come everybody (Come on, come on)
Me and you, all of us 'bout to really party (Really party)
And you know that we're gonna put it down (Put it down)
After two more drinks, we'll be feelin' the sound

If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me? (Come dance with me)
If you feelin' the groove, it ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor and just dance for me

Get off the wall, 'cause I know that you can feel me
Stop the fronting and dance for me

So come one, come all, come everybody (Come on, come on)
Me and you, all of us 'bout to really party (Really party)
And you know that we're gonna put it down (Oh)
After four more drinks, we'll be falling down

If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me?
And I know you been stressed, this whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor and just dance for me

Leave all your troubles and your cares behind
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, not tonight, no
Don't drink too much, because we have all night
Don't you rush, because it's all night long

If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me? (Dance for me)
If you feelin' the groove, it ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor and just dance for me (Oh, dance for me)
And I know you been stressed, this whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor and just dance for me (Dance for me, yeah)
'Cause we here, ain't no joke, so stay here 'til we're closed
And stay up on the floor and just dance for me (Oh)

While ladies shake they thangs, brothers chains swang
Dancing is a ritual we use to maintain
Whether steppin' or Crip walkin', over music, **** talkin'
Hard times get softened in spots we hit often
Off in a loft, basement party, or a strip club
Good times, good wine, gotta skeet to trick dubs
It's up to you, I ain't gon' tell you where you has to be
Like the ghost of Marvin, come on and dance for me

If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me?
If you feelin' the groove, it ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor and just dance for me
And I know you been stressed, this whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor and just dance for me
'Cause we here, ain't no joke, so stay here 'til we're closed
And stay up on the floor and just dance for me
If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me?
If you feelin' the groove, it ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor and just dance for me

Oh, oh

Played yourself again, oh, damn
Move to the left again, oh, damn
Wishing that you had this
I know you're wishing that you had this, oh
Played yourself again, that's tragic
Gave you my heart, baby boy, you should've kept it
Wishing that you had this
I know you're wishing that you had this
I done turned up on you, woah
I done turned up on you one time
Told you it would take only one time
You, you, you, you thought that I was lying
When I told you that I can't be no side bitch, oh
I know you want that thing back
You want that love, you want that kiss, you want that sex
Oh, now you wanna make it last

But when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with thе fact you did me wrong forever
You did mе wrong forever
'Cause when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with the fact you did me wrong forever
You did me wrong forever
We the best music

Had, had a real bitch by your side
Riding like a Glock 45
Now, now you're lonely when you slide (We could've been here together)
Tell me what money do
If it don't by honeymoons
I'm sweeter than honeydew
But I caught you sipping strange fruit
You turned me into a dog, I'm barking, woof
Told you just to keep it hundred proof
You made me promises that you couldn't ever keep (Keep going)
Said you was just fucking them and you would get back to me

But, baby, when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with the fact you did me wrong forever
You did me wrong forever
'Cause when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with the fact you did me wrong forever
You did me wrong forever

You did me wrong
When a good girl gone, she gone forever
When a real bitch leave, you gon' wish you never met her
And I'm a real bitch, don't make 'em like me no more
Before I share my bed, I'll sleep on floors
I told you, I'm a wife, I can't be your whore
We different prices, I don't go for what she go for
Please keep your keys, I'm changing all these locks
'Bout to find a new nigga and give him all this box
Tryna bring me down, I'll give him all this top
See, I got some money, boo
I do what I wanna do
And I've been a hundred proof
You turned me to a dog, I'm barking, woof
Now I'm gone, nigga, poof

Baby, when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with the fact you did me wrong forever
You did me wrong forever
'Cause when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with the fact you did me wrong forever
You did me wrong forever

Could it be love, could it be love
At first sight?
Come on, let's go, I see you Mary
I like this right here, you ready?
The queen of hip hop soul
Bad boy, Mary J. Blige, yeah, back together again, let's go

Lookin' at you from a distance
Gettin' all of my attention
Could this be love at first sight, baby
You walked away and I missed you
Visions of wanting to kiss you
How could this be if I don't really know you?
Ohh baby, baby

Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?

You had on the latest fashion
It was a bigger distraction
It drew me closer and closer to you, yeah, baby
I never saw anything like this
But you I just could not resist
I swallowed my pride and stepped through your side
Or could it be - be

Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?

I wanna know if you could call me up (could you call me up sometime? please)
And maybe somebody we just might hook up, could this love at first sight?

Once again, it's that other M&M now
How many women feelin' him?
Somebody call the coroner, quick, Mary is killin 'em
Tell 'em what's the 411 and who came runnin'
When Clef dialed 911 from shots comin'
This somethin' for the radio, guest starring M.C
Johnny Blazin' the hip hop and R&B
What, ya'll thought ya wasn't gon' see me
You can't spell Mary J. Blige without a J.B
Well back to the matter, and it's sex on the platter
She only wanna be happy and I ain't mad at her
You go momma, nowadays, I'm more calmer
And if you take a look at my life, no more drama
Now you know, you searchin' for a Wu-Tang pro
You find me, just bout everywhere the poontang go
Now you know, feel me like your favorite love song
Cause my computer love is the thetruth.com

Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?

Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?

A dream
A simple fantasy
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more

Last night I dreamed
That you were here with me
And we were in each other's arms
It was oh so heavenly
You held me close to you
And whispered in my ear
Let's spend the night together
Sharing love beyond the bed

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share
And the music stopped
In a flash I was all alone
It was just a dream
Haunting me once again

A dream
A simple fantasy (Simple fantasy)
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more

The day you left
You said you would return
Just when you couldn't promise
That you needed some time alone
You said you'd love me
And someday our love would be
I couldn't understand it
I thought we were both happy

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share
Then the music stopped
In a flash I was all alone
It was just a dream
Haunting me once again, oh

A dream
A simple fantasy
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more
(Relive this dream once more)

A simple fantasy

That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more

Oh, a dream
A simple fantasy
(A simple fantasy that I)
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more

A simple fantasy
That I
Wish was reality
That you (You, you, you)
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more

If you wanna be happy (Don't you be a fool)
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me
Never have to be sad again
'Cause I'll always be your friend

I gave my heart to you
What more can I do
To show you how much I care?
About you and all the little things you do
But see, all I ask is that you make me feel like
I'm somebody
All day, all day, every day, give your lovin' away
Whoa...
Baby, can't you see
If we should part
That all my days of loving you
You know they weren't that hard
That's why I'm saying I gotta be strong

I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need, take heed
Don't be a fool like your daddy
If you wanna be happy
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me
Never have to be sad again

I know that I was wrong
For all that carryin' on
But are you gonna hold this against me for life?
You know all I wanted to do is be your wife
And make you happy, yeah

Only one you need, take heed (I'm the only one)
Don't be a fool like your daddy

Never have to be sad again
'Cause I'll always be your friend

If you really don't want me (Want me)
I wish you'd let me know
And I will go so far away
I cannot stay
If you don't want me to, I can
Be a fool for you no more (I don't think so)
You see, I tried
Tried to please you
The best way I know how
And I never deceived you
If only we could trust each other
Stop thinking foolish things
I don't want another lover, so I...

I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need, take heed (I got to be strong)
Don't be a fool like your daddy
If you wanna be happy
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me
Never have to be sad again
'Cause I'll always be your friend
I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need, take heed
Don't be a fool like your daddy
If you wanna be happy (Don't you be a fool)

Hey, no, no-oh, oh-oh
Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
Ain't nobody gonna love you better, boy, than I am
Than I am

When you're out at night and you're in the streets
And you have time to yourself
Think of all the love that you get from me
That you can't find nowhere else
When you're far away and I'm not around
And temptation fills your heart
Think of all the ways that I'm faithful, babe
But to replace me would be hard
'Cause there's nobody

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better (No, nobody)
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better (Nobody)
Ain't nobody gonna love you better (No)
Boy, than I am, than I am (Boy, than I am)

Oh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am

You can try to act single if you wanna (Wanna)
You can go ahead and mingle if you wanna (Wanna)
You can even behave like you don't care
But you know (But you know)
Like I know (Like I know)
That you ain't that foolish
Who you foolin'?
You won't ruin what's been here all along
You ain't movin' from what you've got at home, yeah

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better (Ain't nobody gonna touch you)
Ain't nobody gonna love you better (Oh)
Boy, than I am, than I am (Boy, than I am, oh, oh)

(Nobody, nobody)
Oh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am

I just want you to know
Baby, I love you so
There is no need to go lookin' for nothing more
'Cause I've got everything you'll ever need right here
But if you feel that you need to leave
Just know!

Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better (Ain't nobody, yeah)
Ain't nobody gonna love you better

[Song 62: We Got Hood Love]
8 ContributorsWe Got Hood Love Lyrics
Sometimes I don't get a chance to really tell you
But I promise you, my love will never fail you
Don't you get it? Right now, we're writing history
A thousand years from now, they'll talk about you and me
I know sometimes I go hard for no reason at all
Put your soul through the business and test the weight of your heart
'Cause when your back's on the wall and there's a shortage of friends
You know that I'm with you until the end

We got hood love, I be fussin', I be screamin' like it's over
Then I'm longin', then I'm fienin' just to hold ya
'Cause that's how we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you
How you feel, love? When I'm with you, never quit you
Now that's real love, when you ain't here, then I miss you
'Cause I still love the way that we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you

Sometimes I think about leaving you
But when I think about what we've been through, yeah
I get a feeling like it could be the worst
'Cause I've given you my best and I don't mind it, that's fine
'Cause when you love somebody hard, then you'll love that way for life
You got all of my heart and I'll never leave your side
I gave my word to love you all the way 'til the end
So no matter what I'll be right here I'll be right here 'cause

We got hood love, I be fussin', I be screamin' like it's over
Then I'm longin', then I'm fienin' just to hold ya
'Cause that's how we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you
How you feel, love? When I'm with you, never quit you
Now that's real love, when you ain't here, then I miss you
'Cause I still love the way that we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you

Now I play tough but not for too long
You are someone I depend on
No matter how I act at times, I could never walk away
I thought about it plenty times, but no one could take your place
Well, if there ain't no you, then there ain't no me
And if there ain't no us, then I'd rather be
By myself 'cause no one else
Can know just what I need and really understand me

We got hood love, I be fussin', I be screamin' like it's over
Then I'm longin', then I'm fienin' just to hold ya
'Cause that's how we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you
How you feel, love? When I'm with you, never quit you
Now that's real love, when you ain't here, then I miss you
'Cause I still love the way that we do
You know that hood love is a good love, that's me and you

We've been through the storm
We've been through it all
We had some close calls
But never would fall
We climbed all the mountains
Walked through all the valleys
And you never left me behind

I found my way through the clouds
No more runnin' scared and closing my eyes, oh
I will be true, this love from my heart
I'm laying my life on the line

Oh, I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger)

They said we wouldn't make it
But guess what, we made it
And we got them wondering how
You were always for me
Never been the one to hurt me
You gave me peace of mind

I found my way through the clouds
No more runnin' scared and closing my eyes, oh
I will be true, this love from my heart
I'm laying my life on the line

Oh, I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger)

Sometimes I can't believe
That you are with me
There's nobody lucky as me
So I get on my knees
To make sure that He
Knows that I'm grateful
For what He gave me

Oh, I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger)

If I tell the truth, I would say that I've been hurt many times before
So it's hard for me to ever wanna give anybody, anybody else love
What's bitter and broken until you, shoved inside my heart
I guess God needs you where you are
'Cause the pain I felt before, don't exist anymore

You light up my dark, oh
I been broken for a long time
Now I'm standing in the sunshine
It's kinda crazy how you made me smile
'Cause the winds in my life been blowing
But you made me smile
And I wanna know how
'Cause I never thought I had enough
I been holding back a lot of love
But you make me smile
And I wanna know how
'Cause it's scaring me, darling
And I'm falling and falling
Just make sure you catch me
I'm only thinking 'bout now
How you make me smile, smile, smile

I feel strong, I feel well
I feel confident, better about myself
Life was dust, yeah, turned to coal
And I guess it's your time, you found a diamond in my soul

So you lighten up my dark, my dark
I been broken for a long time
Now I'm standing in the sunshine
It's kinda crazy how you make me smile
'Cause the winds in my life been blowing
But you make me smile
And I wanna know how
'Cause I never thought I had enough
I been holding back a lot of love
But you make me smile
I just wanna know how

I been touching all around, you know
I been looking all around for you
And I finally see the light
Took me a long time
But I'm glad I finally know the truth
I forgot about the hurt I knew
I just wanna give my love to you
'Cause a mirror don't scare me
Now

I feel strong, I feel well
I feel confident, better about myself
You're really making me smile
You make me smile
And I just wanna know how
'Cause it's scaring me, darling
And I'm falling and falling
Just make sure you catch me
I'm only thinking 'bout now
How you make me smile, smile, smile
How you do it

Why would I spend the rest of my days unhappy?
Why would I spend the rest of this year alone?
When I can go therapy, when I can go therapy
When I can go therapy, two times a day

Why would I spend the rest of this week so bitter?
And all that listenin' is makin' you bitter too
When I can go therapy, when I can go therapy
When I can go therapy, two times a day

I don't wanna be around me
And I don't blame you if you're blocking all my calls
Been awhile since I've been sleeping soundly
Most nights I lie awake, between 2 and 4
Work is stressing me out
And after all this time, it's still never enough

Why would I spend the rest of my days unhappy?
Why would I spend the rest of this year alone?
When I can go therapy, when I can go therapy
When I can go therapy, two times a day

I care more about what you think than I care about the music
When I get cross with you, I'm surprised you care at all
I figure if I had a lifetime of time left
Well shame on me if I don't get to use it well
Yeah I'm stressin' you out
And at the way it's goin', you'll need it more than me

Why would I spend the rest of my days unhappy?
Why would I spend the rest of this year alone?
When I can go therapy, when I can go therapy
When I can go therapy, two times a day

Someone, help me, turn me 'round
I'm a victim
Hate the sound of my own voice
Turn it down
And all I do is aggravate you

Why would I spend the rest of my days so bitter?
And all that listenin' is makin' you bitter too
When I can go therapy, when I can go therapy
When I can go therapy, two times a day

Ain't nothing going on 'tween me and you

And all I know is I can't let go
And that's the way it is, oh

Is it a wallet? This is your life
It ain't no secret

No secret, my friend, you can get killed just for living in
Your American skin

Yeah
Oh yeah

Oh-oh
If I die right before I wake
Cross my heart, then I seal my fate
Life in the dark of the heartless
Looking at the remedy for all this
Everyday they look at you a target
Falling victim, them and
Him and her then this one, insensitivity
Talk bad religion, skin identity
Lack rash decision made by yours
Pack facility with the urban boy
Gun admitted he bear arm
The entity, arm and leg and head made to destroy
80% of the victim was yours
Maybe I get to relive years of war
Look on the corner, we been here before
Look at the momma, you seen tears before?
Pain bright and early
Rain, sleet, hail, snow, worry
More storm barricade the city
Prosecution, unhung jury
These days murder keep 'em busy
Sweet blood flowed on the gurney
Yellow tape tied around the street
Colin Kaepernick was more than worthy
I could reverse the day, reverse the time
Reverse the block, reverse the gun, reverse the shot
Reverse the law, reverse the flaw
That made us all the versions of a danger flock
Reverse the love, reverse the hate
Reverse the hope, reverse the way we playing sin
Reverse the moment, so we can live again
Life and times of the American skin

I was a fool to let you in
Knowing you would play with my heart
But that was so long ago that I thought we could make a new start
You left me broken-hearted from the day your love departed
Now that love you found with someone new is gone
And so you wanna come back

Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?

I was loving you, kissing you, holding you tight
I wish you know that woman that you learned to leave today
And it’s a shame that you wanna come back now, baby

Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you?

All my days and nights so lonely
'Til you came into my life

Cause I was dying deep inside

To the love that you give to me
And with all this love comes trust

You're so...

With unconditional love
Tender sweet is he that helps me
Leave my problems all behind

Where love flows unselfishly and never ever demanding

[Song 73: Deep Inside]
9 ContributorsDeep Inside Lyrics
The problem is for many years
I've lived my life publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust
I really trust
And every time I find someone I like, gotta worry about
If it's really me that they see
And I thought you were the one, ohhhh...

Deep inside I wish that you could see
(I wish that they could see)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(I wish that they could see)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary

I don't have a lot of friends
And sometimes I have to wonder
Is it cash they see when they look at me?
'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free
So I made the choice to be
Good to those who are good to me
Don't judge me or think I'm bitter
For the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary

I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
(I'm just Mary, can't you see that I, I...)
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
(I said, I said I'm just Mary)
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
(Deep inside I wish that...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
(I wish that they can see that I'm Mary, yeah)
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(Deep inside I wish that...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(Every day of my life I wish...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(And I wish, I wish, I wish...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary

The car i drive, the clothes i wear
The diamonds, the furs, and the house
Don't make the woman
Material things don't mean nothing to me
So, I need someone to stand by me and supply my needs
And I'm just plain ol' Mary
Why can't you love the person inside, and stop lookin' outside

Deep inside I wish that they could see
(I said that I'm just Mary)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(Said I wish, and I wish, and I wish, and I wish...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary (MJB, yeah)
Deep inside I wish that you could see
If I could give you something else
But I can't give you nothing but me all day and all night (Mary)
I'm just Mary, Mary, Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
(It can't be the clothes or the car I drive, 'cause I...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(See the problem is, for many years, I've lived my life publicly...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary

When you touch me boy you drive me crazy
I don't wanna be your secret lover
When I get you boy there'll be no other
You and me its gotta be (the real thing)
Diamond, gold I'll set you free (my baby)
Wait too long boy I'll be gone (so hurry)
Wanna get this love don't do me wrong

What you feel now (I think I need you)
What you know now ( to be real)

If you promise not to ever mention
All the things we do to any of your friends
I will promise you love never ends

Knock knocked and you opened up now you
Can't get enough, you was thinking one lil' date
Ate sushi wit ya soul mate
Dead the ice or the SUV's
Our love grows we chose to water the seeds
You the one I've fallen for the more we walk down love's corridor
The angels all applaud (I want ya)
See the look in my eyes don't ya

Gimme ya palm ma lemme read ya fortune

One look in your face just prove the fact
That u don't have 2 chase what u can attract

6 ContributorsGood Woman Down Lyrics

In my life, I've seen it all
And now it's time
For me to pass on this knowledge to you
All my sisters
My troubled sisters
This is my gift to you

Been many days, couldn't take the pain
Felt I should take my life away
See it every day in every other young sister's fate
(Young sister, sister)
See, I'm cryin' now, mind full of doubt
Runnin' in the streets, no self-esteem
Thinkin' that used to be me
What a shame

Damn, life is a mutha, it's hard to sit back
And see the same thing that happened to me happen to you
This ain't love, but here's the love I wanna give to you

It doesn't matter what they say or do (Do)
Don't let it get to you (You)
Don't be afraid, you can, you can, you can break through
Take what I been through (Through)
To see that
You can't hold a good woman down (Down)
Went through the same point of giving up (Up, up)
Felt like I had enough ('Nough)
Went to the edge of the ledge but I didn't jump
My life will sum it up (Up)
You can't hold a good woman down

Ooh, when I used to see my daddy beat
My mother down, down to her feet
I used to say that ain't gon' never be me (Never be me)
Now look at you, bruised up from him
Girl, recognize you're better than
Him telling you that he'll never hit you again
Girl, don't cry

Damn, life is a mutha, it's hard to sit back
And see the same thing that happened to me happen to you
This ain't love, but here's the love I wanna give to you

It doesn't matter what they say or do (Do)
Don't let it get to you (You)
Don't be afraid, you can, you can, you can break through
Take what I been through (Through)
To see that
You can't hold a good woman down (Down)
Went through the same point of giving up (Up, up)
Felt like I had enough ('Nough)
Went to the edge of the ledge but I didn't jump
My life will sum it up (Up)
You can't hold a good woman down

Through your changes I will hold your hand
Use my songs as remedy
Whenever you're feeling down and blue
I'll be there for you
Trust and know that I've been where you're at
Seen the things that you can't see
Looking at you resembles me
But you gotta hold on

It doesn't matter what they say or do (Do)
(Ooh, girl, don't cry)
Don't let it get to you (You)
Don't be afraid, you can, you can, you can break through
Take what I been through (Through)
To see that
You can't hold a good woman down (Down)
(You can't hold a good woman down)
Went through the same point of giving up (Up, up)
Felt like I had enough ('Nough)
Went to the edge of the ledge but I didn't jump
(Went to the edge of the ledge but I didn't jump)
My life will sum it up (Up)
You can't hold a good woman down

You can't hold me, you can't hold me down, you can't hold me
You can't hold me down, you can't hold me
You can't hold a good woman down, oh, oh
You can't hold me down, can't hold me down, no, no, no

There you have it
I'm still with you, my sisters
My troubled sisters
I still have troubles too
(You can't hold a good woman down)
You're not alone
I'll always be there for you
Rock on
(You can't hold a good woman down)

9 ContributorsNot Today Lyrics
Uh, this is another one of those heartbreak hotel joints
For the ladies, uh, mmm, ooh, hmm

Why won't you grow up and be a man someday
I can't believe that you're still playing silly games
Now why do I put up with all this child's play
Now if your word is all you have then you ain't worth a damn thang

Promises, you told me every day (yeah, hmm)
That you made, you never ever cared (ooh yeah)
Not with me, I really want to believe
Well not today (mm, not today), not today (not today, ooh)

You're the worst, I can't even depend on you
You say I'm not a good thing, but something else you always do
Be a man of your word, try to love something of loving you
But now you can be on your way, cause I don't want you (promises)

Promises about a house
Bout the kids, lifestyle, we would live
Who the fuck you really is?
In my face all the time spittin' line after line
Broke down my wall and you got in my mind
You's a fake should a known
All the signs I was shown
Can't believe what I saw, and your cover was blown
Break up, leave
Make up, please
You's a magician all them tricks up your sleeve
Had me for a minute, I was in it
You played good
But I'm a bitch you gotta get it so I make moves
And I'm a leave you where you at, dog, chill
Go back to square one, wait for something real, huh
Selfish nigga, coulda helped you nigga
Usually know better but I felt you nigga
I guess gettin in my head was a part of the plan
Cause in reality the only thing you giving me is

Promises, you told me everyday (that you told me everyday, everyday)
That you made, you never ever cared (you never, never, never)
Not with me, I really want to believe (never cared)
Well not today (not today), not today (not today, babe)
Promises, you told me everyday (that you told me everyday)
That you made, you never ever cared (you never, never, never, never cared)
Not with me, I really want to believe (I really, really, really)
Well not today (not today), not today (not today, ooh)

Don't let him waste your time girl (don't let him waste your time girl)
He's only telling lies girl (he's only telling some lies to you)
When he apologizes (and he will, he will)
Don't even leave (ooh)
Cause he will do it again

Promises, you told me everyday (ooh you told me everyday)
That you made, you never ever cared (you never, never, never cared)
Not with me, I really want to believe (I really want to believe)
Well not today (not today), not today (not today)

[Song 77: Sincerity]
14 ContributorsSincerity Lyrics
Uh

Now there's two ways we can do this: keep it real or front
I know you got what I need and I got what you want
And the hunt for soulmates is all over for us
We could go away where nobody would know it was us
Leave behind all the fuss, the studios, pictures
No autographs, just laughs when I'm wit' ya
I know what it's like when they know you now
But bark at your dog, baby, and I'll hold you down

Time and time and time again
I knew that our love had to end
But now it's gone so very far
That I can make a brand new start
I thought that we were meant to be
Be one big family
But I was weak and loved you still
No matter what you did, I could forgive

All I need is sincerity (All I need)
All I need is sincerity

Thinking 'bout you all the time
Never seemed to cross my mind
How you could take the time to kill
Everything our love had built
I never knew how you could hide
Every time you told a lie
But now I know why you're so cold
But I don't understand
Now that you set me free
I truly think that we
Could find love separately
I need sincerity
One thing I'm not is weak
I'll always stand alone
But my heart is not made of stone
So I'll go on, on

All I need is sincerity (All I need is sincerity, all I need)
All I need is sincerity

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Chipped tooth don
Nasty, blue ice Timbs on
Screwface, half moon part, my tattoos dark
On a scale of tough criminals, nothing to call me
I'm a rare individual, young and I'm bossy
Guess it come from a rough life, cuffed at night
Letting off hot lead that bust from iron pipes
I'm the type that had to shed blood
Pray to the ghost of dead thugs, dead blocks that spread drugs
Fled from the cops 'til my first joint dropped
I'm still wit' my hood, hollow points still in the Glocks
But I've been shitted on by these high class hoes
Even these chickens did me wrong, I was just getting on
So I turned cold, giving 'em hard dick and straight to the hole
Like Rod Strickland, it was taking its toll
I needed someone I could hold in my darkest hours
A strong couple is a blessing and the heart is the power
Give me someone I could trust, not just a hottie to bone
Does she love Escobar or love Nasir Jones?
Let me know so I could cop her the stones
What's clear to me is sincerity
Somebody I could call my own, yeah

(All I need is sincerity)
I never knew why you could hide
Every time you told a lie
I just wanna know why
(All I need is sincerity)
Oh why, oh why, oh oh why
Why oh why why why
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Oh, oh, oh, oh (Is sincerity)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Is sincerity)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

(All I need is sincerity)
I never knew why, never wanted to know why
Why you could hide every time you told a lie
(All I need is sincerity) All
(All I need is sincerity) All I need is sincerity
(All I need is sincerity) You, you, you and me
(All I need is sincerity) Oh, oh, oh, oh

So much on my mind, you gotta understand
I ain't got much time for you, so I
Rather be alone, oh, oh

Now you miss you water
What you gonna do? Your well went dry
Was I the one you thought of?
I know you see that pain behind these eyes
Now I know you're caught up
Damn, I know you're caught up, oh

Ooh, baby, you're not telling the truth
After all that I done for you
Still tryna play me for a fool

Oh, I'm not gonna die, no, not again
My heart won't survive this pain again
But I'll be alright, yes indeed
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm strong, oh, oh

Now you miss you water
What you gonna do? Your well went dry
Was I the one you thought of?
I know you see that pain behind these eyes
Now I know you're caught up
Damn, I know you're caught up, oh

Ooh, baby, you're not telling the truth
After all that I done for you
Still tryna play me for a fool
Ooh, baby, you're not telling the truth
After all that I done for you
Still tryna play me for a fool

So what if you did this to me?
Why you set me free?
I need a man, lover of my soul
Someone who cares for me
Cares for all of my needs
Was blind but now I see
You're not the one

Ooh, baby, you're not telling the truth
After all that I done for you
Still tryna play me for a fool
Ooh, baby, you're not telling the truth
After all that I done for you
Still tryna play me for a fool

9 ContributorsFeel Inside (Original Version) Lyrics
I wanna make you happy
It's a hundred on the dash, gave a hundred percent
You can do the math, 20/20 vision
But you just don't see it

Laced-up Giuseppe boots, I'm all good
Keys in that thing, interior all wood
Mountains and hills is in the rearview
But peace of mind is what I don't got
You make a girl hit up the dope spot
White line, is a thin line
Prenup been signed
So quit playing, bench time

I wanna make you happy, but you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe, but I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things til we make each other cry
What are we doing? Will it ever get better?

I gave you eveything that I've got
Watch my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
Feel inside

Guess who used to say, "Yes, boo"
Now when you say, "Baby," it's fake, test tube
Jet white, we don't do JetBlue
Skinny tire on that thing, winter fresh blue
Superstar, you know I'm in the press room
That's why I'm shitting on these bitches, restroom
Haha-haha, that's caca-caca
Get the fuck up out my face with all that rah-rah, rah-rah
You been wack
Might send some Brooklyn niggas, get you kidnapped
With your bitch ass
Hit the dryer 'cause you washed, splish splash

I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in
Won't you make up your mind? Boy, decide (decide, decide)
We can't go on like this, this ain't right
I'm feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go

I gave you eveything that I've got
Watch my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
Feel inside

Uh-huh, this is a Mary J. Blige Nicki Minaj knockout collabo

I been laying here, waiting for something
Realizing I'm waiting for nothing
Because I gotta get it, get it
'Cause ain't no one doing it for me
I'm the only one telling my story
And I come such a long way

From really feeling like I'm gonna lose it
Now I'm helping somebody get through it
Yeah, I feel pain but I use it
To break through the confusion
That has nothing to do with
Where I'm going 'cause I'm determined to win
There's no losing

No, that can't be
Heart of a fighter, so no, you can't break me
Lock me out if you wanna
Already found the key
You can try but don't be surprised 'cause
I'm a survivor
No matter how low I go, I'm gonna rise up
And I can't take the credit
All the glory to my provider
And I'm burning so bright, you can't put out my fire
So there ain't nothing realer that can stop me, I'm a survivor

They keep telling me, "Mary, it's over"
Had your run but girl, look at the numbers
Maybe you should just quit it, quit it
But I'm nearly finished the chapter
And they can't keep me from what I'm after
'Cause I come such a long way

And now I'm finally seeing me clearly
And I can work with the pain 'cause you build me
'Cause now I know how to use it
To break through the confusion
That's got nothing to do with
Where I'm going 'cause I'm determined to win
There's no losing

No, that can't be
Heart of a fighter, so no, you can't break me
Lock me out if you wanna
Already found the key
You can try but don't be surprised 'cause

No matter how low I go, I'm gonna rise up
And I can't take the credit

And I'm burning so bright, you can't put out my fire
So there ain't nothing realer that can stop me, I'm a survivor

Oh, I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor, oh
I'm on my way, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nothing's gonna stop me, no, no, no, no
I paved the way, woah
For so many to break free
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor
No matter how hard, I'ma still keep my light up
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor
No matter how hard, I'ma shine even brighter

No, that can't be
Heart of a fighter, so no, you can't break me
Lock me out if you wanna
Already found the key
You can try but don't be surprised 'cause
I'm a survivor
No matter how low I go, I'm gonna rise up

In each tear (Yeah)
There's a lesson (There's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (Wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (Stronger)
And each tear (Oh, each tear)
Brings you closer to your dream
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what you're meant to be

We can't change the things
That we done that's in the past
But fighting won't get us anywhere
So if you want, here's my hand
(Willing to say)

Every night there's one thing I do (Willing to say)
I bow my head and I pray for you (Pray for you)
And the last thing that I want
Is for you to fall apart
Your future will be clearer
I want you to remember

In each tear
There's a lesson (There's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (Wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (Stronger)
And each tear (Oh, each tear)
Brings you closer to your dream
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what you're meant to be

You're much more than a struggle that you go through
You're not defined by your pain, so let it go
You're not a victim
You're more like a winner
And you're not in defeat
You're more like a queen, oh

In each tear (In each tear)
There's a lesson
Makes you wiser than before
Makes you stronger than you know (Stronger than you know)
And each tear (Each tear)
Brings you closer to your dream
'Cause no mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what you're meant to be
In each tear (Each tear, tear)
There's a lesson (There's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (Wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know
And each tear (Makes you so much stronger)
Brings you closer to your dreams
Oh, no mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what you're meant to be

No, no, we can't be held down (No-no, no-no)
I, I, I can't held down
You, you, you can't be held down
We, we, we can't be held down, love
It makes you so much stronger
It makes you so much wiser
(In each tear) Each tear
And you're so close to your dreams
And, no mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what you're meant to be

Seen many men in my time
But none of them compare to mine
I ain't gotta knock on wood
To tell y'all that I got it so good
He's everything that I need and
All that a man should be, and
Put me on a flight if I wanna
Buy out the mall if I wanna

6 ContributorsThe Living Proof Lyrics
It's gonna be a long long journey
It's gonna be an uphill climb
It's gonna be a tough fight
There's gonna be some lonely nights
But I'm ready to carry on

I’m so glad the worst is over
('Cause it almost took me out)
I can start living now
Ooh, I feel like I can do anything
And finally I'm not afraid to breathe

Anything you say to me
And everything you do
You can’t deny the truth
'Cause I’m the living proof
So many don’t survive
They just don’t make it through
But look at me, oh
I’m the living proof
Oh, yes I am

Thinkin' 'bout life's been painful
(Yes it was)
Took awhile to learn how to smile
So now I’m gonna talk to my people, oh oh
About the storm, oh
About the storm, oh

So glad the worst is over
('Cause it's all beneath me now)
I can start flying now, oh ho
My best days are right in front of me
Yet I’m almost there
'Cause now I’m free, oh

Anything you say to me
And everything you do
You can’t deny the truth
'Cause I’m the living proof
So many don’t survive
They just don’t make it through
But look at me, oh
I’m the living proof

I know where I’m going, hey
'Cause I know where I’ve been, oh oh
I got a few stars that's showin', hey
I’ma stay strong, keep going
That’s the way that I’ll win

Anything you say to me
And everything you do
(Everything you do)
You can’t deny the truth
'Cause I'm the living proof
So many don’t survive
They just don’t make it through
But look at me, yeah yeah
I’m the living proof

Nothing ‘bout my life’s been easy, no
But nothing’s gonna keep me down, no, down, no
'Cause I know a lot more today
Than I knew yesterday
So I’m ready to carry on
Oh Lordy, mmm

Did you know, did you know, did you know
That I love you
Did you know, did you know, did you know, did you know
And I want you

I'll admit things ain't been the way I thought they would be
Didn't expect so much stress to develop between me and you
I knew that it wasn't easy
But sometimes when we fight it don't seems like God's design
But then I hear words you said, and I promised I would
Stand for you and be true throughout the bad and the good
And I know what it means to be committed
So here's a word for you but you just ain't with it

Stay down

But the wife of George and we're moving on up
Ten years strong and we're looking like a plan
I'm looking like your woman and you're looking like my man

Especially when they hear me say

And I'm holding yours so we can't live apart
When things stop making sense we'll figure it out
I walked into this and I don't wanna walk out no, no
Everything ain't gonna be how we like
And what is worth keeping if it didn't take a fight?
Your healing is in me, and my healing is in you
So get your mind right 'cause here's what we're gonna do

Uh

I still believe in it, fear not
No strings attached, tongues out with your shell tops
Like Run-DMC wore, was lovin' you before
The G4s, yacht parties out on Capri shores
Ain't from Maryland, but I think we could be more of an item (Uh-huh)
Size right on my ices (Uh-huh)
Trust me, nothing like 'em (At all)
Was times I would F they minds before I pipe 'em (I know)
Make 'em feel like the love of my life before I psych 'em

Well, it's a whole new day, a whole new wave
Ain't worried 'bout nothing
Everything's looking up, yeah
Well, I was going through a phase, stuck in old ways
Always thinkin' somethin'
Like I ain't never good enough, yeah

I been thinkin' of the time I wasted
I been lookin' in all the wrong places for love
That really brought me down, yeah
I'm so sick of being sad or lonely
Until I can find the one I know I need
I'll never give up on me, no

I still believe in love, ooh
Oh, love

Just 'cause you see me alone and I'm all on my own
It don't mean a thing
Just know I could find me somebody so easily, yeah
I can't lower my standards
I demand a guy to treat me like the queen that I be
In the middle of the night fantasize he only thinkin' 'bout me

I been thinkin' of the time I wasted
I been lookin' in all the wrong places for love
That really brought me down, yeah
I'm so sick of being sad and lonely
Until I can find the one, I know I need

I first met you you was movin' with somethin'
But I could tell you was losin' your, uh

3 ContributorsHourglass Lyrics
If you could see your seconds in an hourglass
If you could see the minutes of a life you had
Would you run and would you try
To win it back?
If you can see a future in a photograph
If you could see the light that you wish you had
Could you be strong and carry on
With what you have?

Why we wasting life?
Should be chasing life

If we're breathing for the very last time
I don't wanna hold onto goodbyes
If there's no tomorrow
You better make it last tonight
If we're standing when the walls come down
If we make it to the final round
If we're here tomorrow
We'll live it better than we did last night

If you werе on your knees, would you take a stand?
If you were in deep, would you takе my hand?
Could you lie and lose your pride
To live again?
If you could wake up and see through yourself
Could you find a room to blame someone else?
Could you change in just a day
And cry for help?

Why we wasting life?
Should be chasing life

If we're breathing for the very last time
I don't wanna hold onto goodbyes
If there's no tomorrow
You better make it last tonight
If we're standing when the walls come down
If we make it to the final round
If we're here tomorrow
We'll live it better than we did last night

'Cause you're not alone, no, you're not alone
We've all been wasting time
No, it's not too late for us to make it right
But we still have today

If we're breathing for the very last time
I don't wanna hold onto goodbyes
If there's no tomorrow
You better make it last tonight
If we're standing when the walls come down
If we make it to the final round
If we're here tomorrow
We'll live it better than we did last night

Ayy, I'm not gon' lie, I hate to take an L
Had me sittin' there hot like waiting rooms in hell
But I'm not gon' cry, no way to exhale
Just got me some fresh air and got me a fresh pair
Of them white-on-white Forces, yeah, summertime classics, yeah
Tryna keep them clean, but you still could get your ass kicked
So better breathe, nigga, one and then a two
I'm the one, I'm not the two, I'm the one they look up to
Haters see me coming through, gotta shut their mouth now (Shh)
They huff and they puff, but couldn't blow this house down
Heard the best swimmer say it's 'bout controllin' your breath
I still got the watch lookin' like it's holdin' its breath
I got the blue face, baby, full of Chrisean rocks
If you're grievin', keep believin', baby, just don't stop
Now check it, me and Blige remain fly
They mad 'cause they left us for dead, but we ain't die
Fuck 'em

Those things you do to me
Leaves a lasting impression on my heart
There ain't no second best
I've had my wasted times, but no regrets

Let me have you up just a little
Now you're patient with me, got me stuck like a riddle
You get from top to bottom, never rush in the middle
You never gone too long, but I swear that I miss you
Damn right, I swear that I miss you (Miss you)
Since we've been together, I've been countin' seconds with you
Didn't think I need you right here
So used to holdin' it in, but now I'm breathing
And I'm inhalin' deep, boy, I am breathing
You're so much better for me, oh
Feel so brand new
Fresh air, good news, breathing
So much better for me, yeah

I know exes can't breathe (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Blindness, but you and me, we give each other space
I'm always excited to see ya, I never really felt this freedom
I think to myself, "Is this real or can I be dreamin'?"
I think I'm in love

Let me have you up just a little
Now you're patient with me, got me stuck like a riddle
You get from top to bottom, never rush in the middle
You never gone too long, but I swear that I miss you (Swear that I miss you)
Damn right, I swear that I miss you (Miss you)
Since we've been together, I've been countin' seconds with you
Didn't think I need you right here

Considered you my friend and my lover, woo
I think of how I went so hard for you
Gave my heart to you
Went to war for you
I got scars for you
Would have did time behind bars for you, yeah

Thank you, baby, really thank you, baby
'Cause now I finally, now I know the truth
Thank you for showing me who you really are
Oh, 'cause up 'til now, I wouldn't believe
You would go this far
See you tryna hurt
What was deep inside, but that wasn't you
Oh, but thank you, baby
Really thank you, thank you, baby
'Cause now I know the truth

I know they say the truth hurts, but a lie kills
I shoulda known that before, you ain't for real
Mind yourself, oh, I'm so mad
But I thank you, thank you, thank you
When people show you who they are, we should believe them
How could I let it get this far?
I could have seen it
But now I see the light and I'm alright
And I thank you, thank you, thank you

13 ContributorsIt’s Me Lyrics
You fell in love with who you're lookin' at
Something has changed and there's no hiding that
Sometimes I wish that I can read your mind
And see what secrets you have I can't find

I don't know what you're doing
Or how you spend your time
I've been getting this feeling
That something just ain't right
And I hope that I'm wrong
I don't wanna be right
You won't do this to me
Not me, not me

Why you asking me these questions? It's me
You know I ain't hiding nothing, it's me, it's me
You know I wear everything on my sleeve
You already know
It's me, it's me
Why you acting like a stranger? It's me
I have always been the same girl, it's me, it's me
Why is it a problem now?
It's like you just figured out
That it's me, it's me, it's me

Is there something you wanna talk about?
'Cause everything I do upsets you now
I'm starting to feel some type of way
Starting to feel like it's a game, and I don't wanna play

I don't know what you're doing
Or how you spend your time
No, I've been getting this feeling
That something just ain't right
And I hope that I'm wrong (I hope)
I don't wanna be right
You won't do this to me
Not me, not me

Why you asking me these questions? It's me
Oh, you know I ain't hiding nothing it's me, it's me
You know I wear everything on my sleeve (Everything, everything)
You already know (You, you, you already know)
It's me, it's me
Why you acting like a stranger? It's me
(Why you acting like a stranger, yeah)
I have always been the same girl it's me, it's me (I never had a representative)
Why is it a problem now? (Why?)
It's like you just figured out
It's me, it's me, it's me (Yeah, yeah)

I don't really understand
Is this really happening?
Am I crazy?
No, it ain't me
You're the one that's losin' it
Why you lookin' at me so different
Thought I used to be your best friend
Now on the outside looking in

Why you asking me theses questions? It's me (Why, why, oh why?)
You know I ain't hiding nothing it's me it's me
(You know I ain't hiding nothing, babe)
You know I wear everything on my sleeve (Everything)
You already know me
It's me, it's me (you already know)
Why you acting like a stranger? It's me
(Why you acting like a stranger, babe)
I have always been the same girl it's me, it's me

It's me, it's me, it's me

About, um, a situation I'm pretty sure y'all be able to relate to
Trust me

Today I'm not feelin' pretty
See I'm feelin' quite ugly
Havin' one of those days when I can't make up my mind
So don't even look at me
See, I don't wanna hear your problems
'Cause I'm havin' some of my own
I know it's not your fault that I'm feelin' down
I just want to be left alone
I'm down and out in depression (Way down)
I think the worst of everything (This ain't right)
My lower back is aching and my clothes don't fit (Oh shit)
Now ain't that a bitch? (Yes it is, yeah)
Got an attitude and I ain't talkin' to you
Only if the shoe fits, yeah
I don't care what you think about me, no, no, no, no
I don't need you crowdin' 'round me now, don't need your sympathy
I don't need it
Oh, don't need it
PMS

Goin' through somethin' tonight, some in the day

Well, it was like a party (Party)
But the kiss feels better off (Kiss feels better off)
You told me all those lies
That I said you did
And I can't give you one more chance
But I bet you I will show you
That the pick of the litter comes a little bigger than I said it would
And it's been coming for a long time

L, let's get you ready for the lovin' of a lifetime
O, opticians can see just what you can do
V, become a victim on the verge of kickin' ass now
E, it's experience and you'll know what to do

You've been wasting time (You've been wasting time)
Are you out of your mind? (You've been wasting time)
Well, you show me some love

With intentions so high (So high)
You probably need a place to count your cash (Need a place to count your cash)
You said you're sorry so many times
And I'm sorry that you ever did (You ever did)
Well, you can take your life of love
And stick it up in your mainframe
'Cause there'll be no more second chances
No more hot romances
And I like it this way
So let me break it down for you

L, let's get you ready for the lovin' of a lifetime
O, opticians can see just what you can do
V, become a victim on the verge of kickin' ass now
E, it's experience and you'll know what to do

Better stop playin' me, start lovin' me
I ain't the same ho givin' away love for free
All my life sittin' 'round thinkin' how to please you
Been blind so long that my screws were loose
But I've paid my dues, now it's time to move
'Cause I'm sick and tired of playin' the fool
'Cause you play to lose and I play to win
Tryin' not to sin and tried to be your friend
Like every other girl, never sexed your friends
But it's over now, and you saying, "How?"
I found something new that's worth my while
Instead of messin' with a bum cat poster child
But I'm focused now, people saying, "Wow!"
And replace of a frown on my face, a smile
You must be out your mind, I have no time
To get you ready for a love of a lifetime

L, let's get you ready for the lovin' of a lifetime
O, opticians can see just what you can do
V, become a victim on the verge of kickin' ass now
E, it's experience and you'll know what to do

You've been wasting time (You've been wasting time)
Are you out of your mind? (You've been wasting time)
Well, you show me some love

L (Oh)
O (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
V (Oh, oh, oh)
E (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Let's get you ready for the lovin' of a lifetime (Let's get you ready)
Opticians can see just what you can do (Opticians can tell you just what you can do)
Become a victim on the verge of kickin' ass now
It's experience and you'll know what to do (Dang)

Woah, woah, woah
(They said I couldn't do it again but I did)

Can't get you off my mind
Thinking about you all the time
Can't get you off my mind
Thinking about you all the time

The day we met was the last day
That I said I would look anyone else's way
Now you know that I'm with you and I'll always be true
There's nothing in this world that I won't do for you

Can't get you off my mind (Oh-oh, oh)
Thinking about you all the time (All the time)
Can't get you off my mind (Off my mind)
Thinking about you all the time

The day you left, it was so sad
Now I'm standing here holding on to the past
Keep going on
Gotta live your life
If we grow up in time, maybe real love we will find

Can't get you off my mind (Oh-oh, oh)

Tell your bridesmaid to hit off my best man
Always on my mind like money, you my honey
There when I'm laced, there when I'm bummy
Say word, it's type hard for me to get you off, my mind
But I still get dough, of course
True love between a thug and a dove
Poppin' champagne in the tub, what
Ayo, everything revolves around trust
'Cause if it wasn't for you, then there wouldn't be no us
No jealousy, envy, and no lust
Three-two-eight off the lot when I bust
Sittin' in the house counting Lincolns and I'm still thinkin'
Can't get you off, so I'm blinkin'
Sinkin' down in this silk couch, milked out
Your hole in my heart got my love all spilt out

Can't get you off my mind (Can't get you)
Thinking about you all the time (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
Can't get you (Can't get you) off my mind (Off my mind)
Thinking about you all the time (All the time I think about you)
(I can't) Can't get you (I can't get you off my mind) off my mind
Thinking about you all the time

5 ContributorsYou Don’t Have to Worry Lyrics
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

Love is made, made of many things
One of them is trust, but I can't trust you anymore
Things you say, followed by the things you do
They won't hurt me, no, they won't hurt me anymore

You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

Love can make, make a stronger man
But you don't love me (You don't love me)
And I don't feel you're growing strong
The heart you break with your simple lies
You better watch out, baby, the next heart may be your own

I gave you my love, my life, my time
Mine was your own, though you stripped me to the bone
When I asked just how you feel, if our love was the deal
You said, "We got it goin' on," now I feel that love is gone

You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

I won't waste your time, 'cause I'm satisfied
I won't waste your time because I'm satisfied
I won't waste your time, 'cause I'm satisfied
I won't waste your time because I'm satisfied

I gave you my love, my heart, and soul
You took my love, now you want to take control
When a good thing comes your way
Why can't you stay?
I can't go on another day

You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

Ayo, catch this wordage bubonic plague
In your head, back, chest, arms, and legs
When I'm coming through, grab your cranium for alternatum, son
I faze subterranium
My subliminals mix with criminal chemicals
Got more milky syllables...

25/8

I can love you with my eyes closed
I see your heart through a blindfold
I ain't never ever met another better
So my baby ain't no way that I'ma let go
From the North to the South Pole
On the East or the West Coast
Every area code, all over the globe
Ain't nowhere on the planet you can go that I won't

From sun up to sun down
I'll always be around
Every minute of every hour
Still it ain't enough time

'Cause I got days and days of love for you, boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough, no
'Cause I got so much love for you, boy
I need another hour and a day
So I can love you 25/8, 25/8

You ain't gotta worry about me, no
Ain't no questioning my loyalty
You've been there for me even when nobody
Cared enough to check and see if I was breathing
See, don't nobody really know me (know me)
You and me, we got history
So I give you a part for loving me, boy
Put your hand in my hand, I'll lead the way out

From sun up to sun down
I'll always be around
Every minute of every hour
Still it ain't enough time

'Cause I got days and days of love, for you, boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough, oh
'Cause I got so much love for you, boy
I need another hour and a day
So I can love you 25/8

Ain't nobody give me love, give me love like I need
See, I love the way you make me smile
When things ain't going right
You know how to hold me tight
And make the pain go away, oh yeah

Every day baby, every night baby (Every night)
On the weekday, on any day
On everyday, I'm alive baby
I'ma love you, help me sing it out
Every day baby, every night baby
On the weekday, on any day
On every day, I'm alive baby
I'ma love you, help me sing it out

Days and days and days of love, for you, boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough
'Cause I got so much love for you boy

So I can love you 25/8...

[Song 108: Know]
6 ContributorsKnow Lyrics
Lord knows, it just ain't fair
Give me some volume, give me some volume
You know, when hear the word queen
You automatically think of a woman getting everything she wants
But it's not like that at all (At all)
See, being a ruler means sacrifice (Sacrifice)
Most of the time, you get less than what you give (What you give)
So every woman and mother in the world is a queen
Because she sacrificed so much (So much)

Get so lonely sometimes
Some times I gotta clear my mind
Can't stop walking on water
Feels like I'm dealing at the altar
Gets so heavy sometimes
Carrying this weight of mine
Looks like the seas are partin'
So I might as well start walkin'

Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord
They just don't know, know, know
How hard I had to go, go, go
To get through, to get through
They just don't know, know, know, know
Know, know, know
How many times I lost (How many times I lost)
Just so I could win (Ooh, yeah)
They just don't know, know, know, know
Oh, no, no
How many times I've died (How many times I've died)
Just to live again, oh yeah

When life was coming at me quick, I had to tuck in my emotions (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know He watchin', God, I made it look good, I was chosen
Gone through hell to get to heaven, build a bridge and get over
My snap-back's real, still thick in these jeans, I ain't missing no meals

Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord
They just don't know, know, know
How hard I had to go, go, go
To get through, to get through
They just don't know, know, know, know (Know, know, know)
Know, know, know
How many times I've lost (How many times I've lost)
Just so I could win (Ooh, yeah)

Can’t you see what I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you?
Changes I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you

It’s all gone, the moment that we shared is gone away
Maybe it’s better that we didn’t stay together
Seems like we’ve gone through this a thousand times
Baby, I still don’t have the answer
Why can't you tell me why we couldn’t be together?

Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you?
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)

See, I didn’t want to ever want to cry
But still I need love and affection
Was it that hard for you to show me some attention?
Tell me, baby, did I push you away?
Was I coming on strong for you?
Why can’t you tell me, tell me what am I to do?

Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you?
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)

Don't you wanna be with me?
Don't you wanna be with me?
Don't you wanna be with me?

Can’t you see what I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you?

Can’t you see what I’ve been going through, cause I wanna be with you?

With the ghetto in my rear view, you are my every tomorrow
The world is ours... Mary J. Blige

I've been logging in my bed, crying til my eyes are red
We both said that things will change
But it's still the same shade of gray
I get mad you walk away
When it all just start to fade
I know you're fed up so am I
But we just can't say goodbye
Boy, you know I love you
But I just can't go on no more
Feelin' this way

You got me sayin' why, why, why?
Can't we get it right? (Just can't get it right)
Just can't get it right (Can we get it right?)
Don't know why, why, why?
Can't we get it right
No matter how hard we try

I got her looking at me sideways
Live every night like it's a Friday
My conversations are so monumental
Licking on her ear, I'm whispering a couple riddles
She fell in love with my technique
I made her call me boss when in the bedsheets
We both coming from the same place
All in her both coming at the same place
Still on my dope boy swag
Top down on my Cam'ron, Oh boy swag
Played the hand we were dealt from the beginning, baby
You the dealer, cut the deck, while we winning baby

You got me sayin' why, why, why?
Can't we get it right? (Just can't get it right)
Just can't get it right (Get it right)
Don't know why, why, why?
Can't we get it right (Just can't get it right)
No matter how hard we try

Can't we turn love around
We build it up to break it down
If you knew the way I feel
You would know that this love is real
But live in Heaven, go to hell then
Go right back, across the lesson
Tired of stressin', get the message
I can't live in this depression no more
Boy, you know I love you
But I just can't go on (no more) feeling like this no more

You got me sayin' why, why, why?
Can't we get it right? Just can't get it right
Just can't get it right. Get it right
Don't know why, why, why?
Can't we get it right (Just can't get it right)
No matter how hard we try

Back on my own again (Back on my own, back on my own)
I don't want this to end (I don't want it to end)
But baby I need (I need, I need) a friend to show me some more (to show me some more)
And i think it should be you
{I love this part right here, look where we came from, Mary}
I just want you to show me, to show me some love yeah

You take from me
So why you holding back? Boy, why you holding back?
So vacantly
But you won't get away with that, no, you won't get away with that

They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

Don't wait for me
When you know you did me wrong, I've been holding on too long
Eventually
I’ll make the call

They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round

Oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

Every day, I'm tryna get to know ya
But more and more, you're changin' up your act
Every day, I look for ways to bring us closer
But more and more, you appear to be drawing back
And baby, when we're makin' love, it's getting weaker
My heart don't feel it, and feeling is everything
And I'm feeling like maybe you just don't feel it
And I don't know how to play it
In the past, didn't know how to say it, but I

I've held my tongue too long, I can't do it no more (I just can't do it, baby)
See, how can a man be so cold to a woman that loves him more? (I don't get it at all)
But if you wanna go (There's the door)
I can't hold you (Boy, you're grown)
You must got me confused, I treat myself way too good
And a love that tears you down ain't really love

Every day, I'm gettin' up and makin' breakfast
And more and more, you're walkin' in without a word
And every day, I'm tryna ask, "Baby, what's wrong?"
And more and more, you say I'm getting on your nerves
And then you take me to the level of some bullshit
You said you never had these problems from a white chick
You got me twisted and twisted is just not how I get with it
You need to sit down and hear it, oh

I've held my tongue too long, I can't do it no more (I just can't do it, baby)
See, how can a man be so cold to a woman that loves him more? (I don't get it at all)
But if you wanna go (There's the door)
I can't hold you (Boy, you're grown)
You must got me confused, I treat myself way too good, oh
And a love that tears you down ain't really love, oh yeah

I'm pouring out my heart (My heart)
Don't just sit there while my heart is on the line
Speak your truth (Speak your truth)
What it's worth (What it's worth)
Not a word you say will go unheard
Now if it's like that, then baby, just pack your bags
'Cause I'm sick and tired of fightin'
I'm sick and tired of tryin'
I had enough of waitin'
I'm not that good with playin'
I know I love you, but I love myself too

I've held my tongue too long, I can't do it no more (I just can't do it, baby)
See, how can a man be so cold to a woman that loves him more? (I don't get it at all)
But if you wanna go (There's the door)
I can't hold you (Boy, you're grown)
You must got me confused, treat myself way too good now
And a love that tears you down ain't really love (Ain't really love, ain't really love, no)
I've held my tongue too long, I can't do it no more (Held my tongue too long, and I just can't do it, baby)
See, how can a man be so cold to a woman that loves him more? (How can a man? I don't get it at all)
But if you wanna go (There's the door)
There's the door (Boy, you're grown)
You must got me confused, treat myself way too good, oh yeah
And a love that tears you down ain't really love

To all the women, all over the world
That have to still deal with this issue
You know I've been there too
I had to deal with it with you
But come on now ladies, how many times he got to say her name?
Listen...

You came home late last night
You smelled just like the scent of her
Not only that but you had lipstick all over your shirt
I'm thinking to myself
This man has no respect for me
I knew it all along 'cause you were talking in your sleep

It's a wrap (It's a wrap)
Why you go and do me like that?

What you were saying in your sleep

No doubt about it
But there's nothing left for you and me
Because you're busted
And I might as well go on
Boy, it's gonna take a long time
To make this a happy home

Cause I really don't wanna tell you how I
Am digging you so
I can't let go
But it hurts me to my soul
To tell you every little thing that is on my mind
I can't let you know so I hide it inside
All my feelings for you
Don't want you to
Let it go to your head
I'm mean to you sometimes
But I can't get you off my mind
So I hit you with the game
Always tryna act like your lovin doesn't phase me
When the truth is that it amaze me
You know it's a big lie
Cause you can see right through my eyes
How much I wanna hold you
Give you all my love and baby boy
Let me show you
And I really wanna get to know you


But I've been there
And I've done that
And I've promised never to get hurt again, never again
You drive me crazy but I promised myself
Never to get hurt again, never again

I can't never ever let you see me this way
So I take all my feelings
And I tuck em away
Fronting like I don't want you to hold me tight
So I act like I'm putting up a fight
To get your attention
And make you stay around longer
So I tell you I don't like it
Cause I know that that will make you wanna hold me tighter
I can't help myself I really like ya
2x
I don't deserve it
I can never get hurt again never get hurt again
Never never
I don't deserve it I could never get hurt again
Never get hurt again
Never, oooo

You are my trusted friend, on you I can depend
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you

My darling only you can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray, you'll never go away
I promise I will try until the day I die
To treat you like a king cause you are my everything
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced


You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you

When you're lovin' me, put your lovin' arms around me
When you're lovin' me, said I feel so safe, I find security
When you're lovin' me, forever I want you to hold me
My everything, my every, every, every, everything
 +  + 
You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you

And I thank you, thank you, thank you

Everyday
Everyday it rains (cause things will never be the same)
It will never be the same
Everyday it rains
Things will never change cause I am not the one to blame
How can I try to make you understand?
That I only living the lie
Cause I have to walk around everyday with out a smile
Everyday it rains (cause things will never be the same)
It will never be the same
Everyday it rains
Things will never change cause I am not the one to blame
Waking every morning knowing your not there
Is the only thing that keeps me scared?
All I do is think of you and all the love we shared
Everyday
It keeps on raining in my life it rains
And Everyday is the same
Baby you brighten up my life
You brighten up my life
So realize
Let it rain on me

Everyday it rains and rains
Things will never be the same
Everyday it rains Things will never change cause
I am not the one to blame
I am not the one to blame just because it rains everyday
Oohhhh

Things will never change cause I am not the one to blame

Believe me when I say it that it rains everyday
Got a cloud over me all the time
And I don't know why it rains; it rains and rains
Waking every morning knowing your not there
Is the only thing that keeps me scared?
I don't know when your coming home
But I'll be waiting with open arms
Believe me when it rains it rains for real
Things will never change for I am not the one to blame

Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no

Looking in my mirror
Thinking 'bout last night
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind

Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no

You were saying Mary
Don't let go, hold tight
I just wanna hold you
All through the night

This is something that I can't deny
Boy you know your touch just drives me wild
Won't you take my hand I'll set you free
I want you to belong to me

Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no

Oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh

Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh
Yo, yo, yo
You might bump into the Kiss late night
On the Deegan speeding
In the drop, four thirty on my way to rock a birdie
With automatic lead in the car, bread in the car
Plus I'm gettin' head in the car
My wedding tomorrow
More dutchies to the head, the ready you are
After the session with shorty
I'll be better tomorrow
And you know how we are
We always keep one or two
That don't say much
Like to hit a blunt or two
Or don't mind driving with raw in the trunk
Or freaking off for the week
Top floor in the trunk
Just laying back blowing
Twenty five's a skull
The our keys by the door with bow ties and posts
Can't let me get away
But you ain't ready for Kiss
Got the Chevy and the six
Wrists heavy and shit
Matter of fact we gonna take a trip
And put the dats up
And cop the pink lemonade Cadillac truck

Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no

Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no

Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no

[Song 129: Time]
8 ContributorsTime Lyrics
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)

The end is coming, stop your running
I'm telling you this is the truth
You can talk about what you read about
Everything is on the news
People nowadays so shady
Now what is wrong with them
Something cast a spell up on their minds
And they always wanna condemn

If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)

While you're judging me you should look around
And you'll see how people going down
Some of them are killed over a dime
Now tell me do we really have time
To continue with this madness
Cause I'm sick and tired of this
Trying to crush my world with jealousy
And I'm about to catch a fit

If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)

You're deceiving
What's the meaning
Of you retrieving
The enemy's greeting
We all are leaving someday but
We don't know how we are going
Please believe me when I tell you
That time is not really on our side

If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)

[Song 132: My Favorite Things]
4 ContributorsMy Favorite Things Lyrics
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with string
These are a few of my favorite things
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with string
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

I simply remember my favorite things
Like silver white winters that melt into springs
And then I don't feel so bad
So bad, so bad, so bad

2 ContributorsBe Without You (Rap Version) Lyrics
We used to do the smurf together and bump
Hit Macys up and do {?} all down in the trunk
Aligator blazers and three fingers, playing the boat
Holding that thang, you holding my mans
Like a westside flick with a fly shorty
A bunch of young live niggas want you but their money is corny
What it do lady' Kiss your man hand and let him through sweetie
Watch it, she got a man, it's the remix

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't deal nothing overnight
Cuz a love like this takes some time
People start off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real (cencored) (yes)
See baby we been

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cus I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie' (no)
Make me cry' (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)
I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been


Ayo I heard you in the hood like Hilary
Expensive boots and bags, bullets holding mad artillary
I been seen it coming like an all red, this was the date
Your whip change cus you wanna be more {?}
I blessed you with half my tolernace
Copped you the R5 and you went and crashed it up for following
And yeah, you let dons be dons
The chemistry so sincere, I'mma show and prove it's on
Fuck hanging, I need luck slangin
Plus when you got a real nigga in the cut, what, that's bangin
Kissing your head, getting bread, trying to avoid plagues
Chilling at your momma's crib, kissing they boy legs
Cus when I ain't home, you holding it
If love got it fucked up, tell the truth, ma you stole it
And don't take it personal lady, cus I can't (be without you baby)

Lately I've got this funny feelin'
Somethin' don't feel the same
But he's tellin' me I'm the one to blame
Yes, I know that he still gives me good lovin'
But when he's deep inside
There's somebody else on his mind

Don't waste your time
But it gets so hard to know
Just walk away
You say that I gotta let go
Seen it a million times before
You shouldn't take his stuff no more
Can't waste my time
Girl, it's not hard to know
Should walk away
Yeah, you've gotta let him go
Seen it a million times before
Shouldn't take his sh... no more

Sister girl, sister girl
It's much deeper than what you're thinkin', ooh
When somethin' don't feel the same
You better believe his love has changed
(And I've been tellin' you, tellin' you)
And what you're tellin' me
('Cause it's been hurtin' me, hurtin' me)
Any fool can see
He's got a sweetie on the side
Stop making truth out of his lie

Don't waste your time
But it gets so hard to know
Just walk away
You say that I gotta let go
Seen it a million times before
You shouldn't take his stuff no more
Can't waste my time
Girl, it's not hard to know
Should walk away
Yeah, you've gotta let him go
Seen it a million times before
Shouldn't take his sh... no more
Shouldn't take it, don't you take it

What's the point of love when you've got no trust?
What's the point of stayin' when you've seen enough?
What's the point of givin' what he don't deserve?
(He don't deserve it; no, he don't deserve it)
What's the point of feelin' like there's nothin' inside?
What's the point of sayin' that you still got your pride?
What's the point of givin' what he don't deserve?
(This is a lesson for all my ladies)

(Don't waste your time, walk away)
Oh, I'm so tired to walking away over and over
(Seen it a million times before, you shouldn't take it)
No, I shouldn't take it
The boy is a fool, oh, yes he is
(Don't waste your time, walk away)
Shouldn't take it
(Seen it a million times before, you shouldn't take it)
Sister girl, you shouldn't take it
(Don't waste your time, walk away)
You ain't gon' be my friend no more
(Seen it a million times before, you shouldn't take it)
Cut him loose
(Don't waste your time, walk away)
It's a lowdown dirty shame
(Seen it a million times before, you shouldn't take it)
Oh, oh, oh, he worked his game on you
I know
(Don't waste your time, walk away)
Oh, sister girl, you need to walk now
Yes I do, yes I do, yeah
Oh yeah

People tell me my life was predestined
From my life others shall learn a lesson
Born a leader with the world on my shoulder
Age is young but my mind is much older
Living up to everyone's expectation
Condemned me to a world of damnation
I gotta clear these voices from my head
All these opinionated noises
Listen to the voice of my Creator
Opens door to a path much greater
On this path the days draw nearer
When I can be happy, finally happy, yeah

Searching for my destiny (Searching for)
I'll search for what makes me happy
Lost in what others thought of me
I gotta be happy, finally happy
Searching for my destiny
I'll search for what makes me happy
Lost in what others thought of me
I gotta be happy, finally happy

Time to broaden my horizons
Come out from the dark and opened up my eyes and
Started to define my destiny
Experience what life can really be
No longer concerned with your opinion
Over my life I have dominion
I'm stronger now than before
I'm sure I can be so much more
Not what you thought I would be
'Cause I'm gonna be happy, yeah
I'm gonna be happy
Finally you see, oh

Searching for my destiny (Searching for)
I'll search for what makes me happy
Lost in what others thought of me

I gotta be happy, finally happy
Searching for my destiny (Still searching)
I'll search for what makes me happy (Searching, searching)
Lost in what others thought of me
I gotta be happy, finally happy


Searching for my destiny (Searching for)

Lost in what others thought of me
I gotta be happy, finally happy (I've gotta be)
Searching for my destiny
I'll search for what makes me happy
Lost in what others thought of me
I gotta be happy, finally happy
Searching for my destiny

10 ContributorsNo Idea Lyrics
Bongo by the way
Woo
Brr

Niggas wrapped around the planet
Got me feeling like I'm Janet and it's 1984 (Uh-huh)
Got 'em all in a panic
All this body that I'm giving
Got 'em coming up with different strokes
Been doing shows since high school
To the mall, then record in the mic booth
Tryna get on just like you
Don't chase the money, be humble
And let it find you

No, I can't tell you what to do (No)
I can't tell you how to move (No, no)
No, I can't tell you what to do
I can't tell you how to move (I move)
I know you're thinking that you might know what it is
Still have no idea
'Cause when you finally understand just what it is
Still have no idea

What's love
Thesе days
We don't know what to say
Heartbreak
So much
Wе don't give a fuck, no

Around the corner where X lived
In the school street projects
Cursin' out my exes (Motherfucker, kiss my ass, bitch)
Niggas was dying for less than
Thank God that we made it out the hood
What a blessing
Never know what they might do
Niggas pretending they living a double life too
I ain't never been the type to
Talk about some shit I never really been through

No, I can't tell you what to do (No-ooh, oh)
I can't tell you how to move (I can't)
No, I can't tell you what to do (No)
I can't tell you how to move
I know you're thinking that you might know what it is
Still have no idea
'Cause when you finally understand just what it is
(You still don't have no) Still have no idea

What's love
These days
We don't know what to say
Heartbreak
So much
We don't give a fuck
No idea
Oh, you still won't have no idea

[Song 139: The Love I Never Had]
6 ContributorsThe Love I Never Had Lyrics
You know sometimes
There come a time in your life when
You love something, you have to let it go
And even though you might feel there's still something there
You have to wake up
Stop living in a dream 'cause it's over now
You gotta think about you

I have always wondered why
Why I can't live without you, babe
And I'm longing to be your lady
I understand that you are leaving
Please don't leave here without me, babe
'Cause I think I might go insane

Cause everybody needs someone to love
And I know that it's true
And I know that it's you
I don't understand why you can't be my man
So I better wake up
And stop living in a dream
Yes, I better wake up
'Cause I can't lose the love I never had
Yeah, I better wake up
As painful as it seems
Yes, I better wake up
I cannot lose the love I never had

Every time I close my eyes
I see visions of you and I
Sharing love of a special kind
I got to laugh to keep from crying, yeah
To hide all the pain inside
'Cause I can't get you off my mind

'Cause everybody needs someone to love
And I know that it's true
And I know that it's you
I don't understand why you can't be my man
So I better wake up
And stop living in a dream
Yes, I better wake up
'Cause I can't lose the love I never had
Yeah, I better wake up
As painful as it seems
Yes, I better wake up
I cannot lose the love I never had

Oh, it made me realize
I don't want to live apart
But you don't know how hard I tried
What do I have to lose?
Oh, I think a little bit more than you
And I doubt that you will see things clearly before it's too late

'Cause everybody needs someone to love
And I know that it's true
And I know that it's you
I don't understand why you can't be my man
I guess I better wake up
And stop living in a dream
Yes, I gotta wake up
'Cause I can't lose the love I never had
Yeah, I better wake up
As painful as it seems
Yes, I better wake up
I can't lose the love I never had
I never had, never had, never had
Break it down, break it down

All the times I've cried
It made me realize
That I was only living a lie
But you don't know how hard I tried
To make sure you were satisfied, yeah
'Cause I thought you were only mine
And I doubt if you will see things clearly
Before it's too late, too late, too late
I don't understand why you can't be my man
Oh, everybody needs somebody to love
Everybody needs somebody, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, I can't live with you
And I doubt that you will see things clearly
Before it's too late, yeah
Oh, you hurt me so, you hurt me so
I can't lose, I can't lose
I cannot lose, I cannot lose

One minute I'm so in love and the next I can't stand you
But if you may ask it's just some things that you do
That reminds me of all of the mess that I've been through

All of this baggage with me

With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings

Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, mm, love

When you need love, you can count on me
When you need love, I'm a call away
You can count on me
When you need love, I'm here to stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
When you need love, though

Remind me how it feels waking up in a cloud of love
I'm looking for a tender touch, oh
But I'ma take my time, no rush
I like the way it feels to be free
It's about time, I got options, I won't lie
Don't want you to think my heart is cold
But I've been hurt before

And I just want someone to hold me close briefly
I need someone who knows I'm not the one to be controlled
I may not stay, I may not go
Warning you now, don't get too close
'Causе you gon' miss me everytimе that I go
But I'ma give you something that you can hold
I'll stick around if you can play your hole
And when you

When you need love, you can count on me
When you need love, I'm a call away
You can count on me
When you need love, I'm here to stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
When you need love, though

Feels so good in the beginning
You're a pretty girl and you think you're winning
But when it wears off, it's a bad ending
Don't mind holding you down if you keep your interest

I just want someone to hold me close briefly
I need someone who knows I'm not the one to be controlled
I may not stay, I may not go
Warning you now, don't get too close
'Cause you gon' miss me everytime that I go
But I'ma give you something that you can hold
I'll stick around if you can play your hole
And you know that you

When you need love, you can count on me
When you need love, I'm a call away
You can count on me (Count on me)
When you need love, I'm here to stay (Need love to stay)
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay (Oh, oh)
When you need love, though (Real ones need love)
When you need love, you can count on me (Count on me)
When you need love, I'm a call away (When you need love)
You can count on me (You can count on me, You can count on me, you can count on me)
When you need love, I'm here to stay (Oh, stay, Stay, stay)
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
When you need love, though (Need love to stay, hey, yeah right away)

[Song 147: Find the Love]
8 ContributorsFind the Love Lyrics
Energy so still in the air
Everybody's running scared
You used to be so care free, used to be so happy
Used to have everything we need

Now we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
People, we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love

How beautiful are you and me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Living out our wildest dreams
We can be anything, we can have everything
Just keep the faith in what you believe
Gotta live it up
You only get one life
Gotta give it all
Give up all the strife
Woah, woah, woah
Life is hard and you know
All the hate, it really is too much
So we got to find the love

Now we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
People, we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
We gotta find the love, we gotta
We gotta find the love
Is it over here? Is it over there?
We gotta find the love
Don't look around, find the love
It's deep inside, find the love
Find the love, find the love
Find the love

We don't have to look so far, we don't, no
Because it's right there in our heart, right there in our heart, yeah
Feels like it's so hard to find, looking everywhere
Because it's deep inside our love

Now we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
People, we gotta find the love, find the love, looking everywhere
Find the love, find the love
We gotta find the love, we gotta just gotta find the love
Find the love
Find the love
Find it, find it
We just gotta find the love, find the love
There's a better place for us
We just gotta find the love, find the love

3 ContributorsMary, Did You Know? LyricsMary, Mary, Mary
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy has come to make you new?
This Child that you delivered will soon deliver you
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would calm the storm with His hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy would walked where angels trod?
When you kiss your little baby you know you kissed the face of God?
Mary did you know
Oh oh woah woah ooo
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would one day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?
The sleeping Child you're holding is the Great, the Great, I Am
Oh Mary, Mary, Mary, did you know?

[Song 149: (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]
5 Contributors(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman Lyrics
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
You're the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman...

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it

Now I'm no longer doubtful
To what I'm livin' for
And if I make you happy
I don't need to do more

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman...

Oh baby, what you've done to me
(Done to me)
You make me feel so good inside
(Good inside)
And I just wanna be
(Wanna be)
Close to you, you make me feel so alive

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

You make me feel (You make me feel)
You make me feel (Feel like a real)
You make me feel like a real
You make me feel (You make me feel)
You make me feel (Feel like a real)
You make me feel like a real
(You make me feel, you make me feel)

10 ContributorsLove Will Never Lyrics
Yeah
Love will never, love will never, love
Yeah-ayy, hey
Bongo by the way!

Shuttin' 'em down like we're supposed to
Only make love to the one I'm close to
Celibate, I make you my go-to
I'll do it again this time without you
Don't deny the part when you lied and I cried
But tonight I switched up something
Yeah

Drowning in my mind, love won't feel the same again (Oh, yeah)
Things I sacrificed (Things I sacrificed)
Just to feel something again (Just to feel something again)
Love won't feel thе same

Love will nevеr, love will never, love (Love will never)
Love will never, love will never, love (Love, oh-oh)
Love will never
Love will never
Love won't feel the same again

Trying my hardest not to want you
But I'll thug it out, so I won't go through
Another heartbreak falling for you
So this is the way I have to move
Don't deny the part
When you lied and I cried
But tonight I switched up something, yeah

Drowning in my mind, love won't feel the same again (Won't feel the same again, oh, yeah)
Things I sacrificed (Things I sacrificed)
Just to feel something again (Just to feel, just to fell something again)
(Oh, ho, oh-woah)

Love will never, love will never, love
Love will never, love will never, love (Love won't feel the same again)
Love will never
Love will never (Never, no, no)
Love won't feel the same again

No, no
I've been trying
But I'm tired (Ooh, ooh)
I ain't got nothing else to say
What I gave to you (What I gave to you)
Boy, you played with it
I was a gift you should have treasured every day
Love will never (Love will never)
Love will never
Love won't feel the same again
Never be the same (Oh-ooh)

Drowning in my mind (Drowning in my mind), love won't feel the same again
(Love won't be the same, it won't be the same)
Things I've sacrificed
Just to feel something again (Things I've sacrificed, just to feel)
Love won't feel the same

Love will never, love will never, love (Love)
Love will never, love will never, love (Love)
Love will never
Love will never
Love won't feel the same again
'Cause love will never
Love will never
