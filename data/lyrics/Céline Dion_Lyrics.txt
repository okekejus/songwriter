Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'til we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life, we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
(Why does the heart go on?)
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on


You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Mm, mm-mm

How does a moment last forever?
How can a story never die?
It is love we must hold onto
Never easy, but we try
Sometimes our happiness is captured
Somehow, our time and place stand still
Love lives on inside our hearts and always will

Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

Maybe some moments weren’t so perfect
Maybe some memories not so sweet
But we have to know some bad times
Or our lives are incomplete
Then when the shadows overtake us
Just when we feel all hope is gone
We’ll hear our song and know once more
Our love lives on

How does a moment last forever?
How does our happiness endure?
Through the darkest of our troubles
Love is beauty, love is pure
Love pays no mind to desolation
It flows like a river through the soul
Protects, proceeds, and perseveres
And makes us whole

Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

How does a moment last forever
When our song lives on

[Song 3: The Prayer]
26 ContributorsThe Prayer Lyrics
I pray you'll be our eyes, and watch us where we go
And help us to be wise in times when we don't know
Let this be our prayer, when we lose our way
Lead us to a place, guide us with your grace
To a place where we'll be safe

La luce che tu hai
I pray we'll find your light
Nel cuore resterà
And hold it in our hearts
A ricordarci che
When stars go out each night
L'eterna stella sei
Nella mia preghiera
Let this be our prayer
Quanta fede c'è
When shadows fill our day

Lead us to a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe
Sogniamo un mondo senza più violenza
Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza
Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino
Simbolo di pace, di fraternità

La forza che ci dà
We ask that life be kind
È il desiderio che
And watch us from above
Ognuno trovi amor
We hope each soul will find
Intorno e dentro sé
Another soul to love

Let this be our prayer, let this be our prayer
Just like every child, just like every child

Need to find a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe
È la fede che
Hai acceso in noi
Sento che ci salvera

[Song 4: The Power of Love]
20 ContributorsTranslationsTiếng ViệtThe Power of Love LyricsCeline Dion’s version of “The Power of Love” (also known as “I’m Your Lady”) is one of the more notable covers of Jennifer Rush’s 1984 hit.
The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love
The power of love
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
As I look into your eyes
The power of love (The power of love)
The power of love

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful, baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through, through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
Ooh, baby

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me (Loved me), oh

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark, shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies, you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (Oh, when I couldn't speak)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach (Oh)
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me (Hey)
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (My voice)

J'ai compris tous les mots
J'ai bien compris, merci
Raisonnable et nouveau
C'est ainsi par ici
Que les choses ont changé
Que les fleurs ont fané
Que le temps d'avant
C'était le temps d'avant
Que si tout zappe et lasse
Les amours aussi passent

Il faut que tu saches

J'irai chercher ton cœur
Si tu l'emportes ailleurs
Même si dans tes danses
D'autres dansent tes heures
J'irai chercher ton âme
Dans les froids, dans les flammes
Je te jetterai des sorts
Pour que tu m'aimes encore
Pour que tu m'aimes encore

Fallait pas commencer
M'attirer, me toucher (Baby)
Fallait pas tant donner
Moi, je sais pas jouer
On me dit qu'aujourd'hui
On me dit que les autres font ainsi
Je ne suis pas les autres, non, non, non
Avant que l'on s'attache
Avant que l'on se gâche

Je veux que tu saches

J'irai chercher ton cœur
Si tu l'emportes ailleurs
Même si dans tes danses
D'autres dansent tes heures
J'irai chercher ton âme
Dans les froids, dans les flammes
Je te jetterai des sorts
Pour que tu m'aimes encore

Je trouverai des langages
Pour chanter tes louanges
Je ferai nos bagages
Pour d'infinies vendanges
Les formules magiques
Des marabouts d'Afrique
J'les dirai sans remords
Pour que tu m'aimes encore

Je m'inventerai reine
Pour que tu me retiennes
Je me ferai nouvelle
Pour que le feu reprenne
Je deviendrai ces autres
Qui te donnent du plaisir
Vos jeux seront les nôtres
Si tel est ton désir
Plus brillante, plus belle
Pour une autre étincelle
Je me changerai en or
Pour que tu m'aimes encore

Can you use these tears to put out the fires in my soul?

There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse, and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever (Forever)
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right

And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me

All coming back to me
I can barely recall

You've given me your love
When your smile like the sun that shines through the pain
That's why I'll be there

When the storm rises up, when the shadows descend
Every beat of my heart, every day without end
I will stand like a rock, I will bend till I break
Till there's no more to give, if that's what it takes
I will risk everything, I will fight, I will bleed
I will lay down my life, if that's what you need
Every second I live, that's the promise I make
Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes

Through the wind and the rain, through the smoke and the fire

I will hold on all night and never let go
Every second I live, that's the promise I make

But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch

To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before
Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together

Together, together, forever
Till the end of time
I love you
I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes

[Song 17: Lying Down]
11 ContributorsLying Down Lyrics
Oh, I didn't mean to fall in deep, but I've no regrets
You tried to push me down, you tried to keep me possessed
I gave you my heart, you took the key
But now I paid my debt, it's time I left

And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I've just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes, I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won’t take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down


All it takes is one bold move to change everything
All it takes is loving you to forget, forgive
But I'm having some kind of breakthrough
I'm ready to live

I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I've just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes, I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won’t take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down

I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down

You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won’t take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down

I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down

12 ContributorsImperfections Lyrics
I try to give all of myself to you
But before I can get there
Got parts of me I'm trying to lose

Yeah, I got my own imperfections
I got my own set of scars to hide
I got my own imperfections

Oh, mm

There's so much life I've left to live
And this fire is burning still
When I watch you look at me
I think I could find the will
To stand for every dream
And forsake this solid ground
And give up this fear within
Of what would happen if they ever knew
I'm in love with you

'Cause I'd surrender everything
To feel the chance to live again
I reach to you
I know you can feel it too
We'd make it through
A thousand dreams I still believe
I'd make you give them all to me
I'd hold you in my arms and never let go
I surrender

I know I can't survive
Another night away from you
You're the reason I go on
And now I need to live the truth
Right now, there's no better time
From this fear, I will break free
And I'll live again with love
And no, they can't take that away from me
And they will see, yeah

I'd surrender everything
To feel the chance to live again
I reach to you
I know you can feel it too
We'd make it through
A thousand dreams I still believe
I'd make you give them all to me
I'd hold you in my arms and never let go
I surrender

And this fire is getting stronger, baby
I'll swallow my pride (Swallow my pride)
And I'll be alive (I'll be alive)
Can't you hear my call?

We'll make it through
A thousand dreams I still believe
I'll make you give them all to me
I'll hold you in my arms and never let go
I surrender

Right here, right now
I give my life to live again
I'll break free, take me
My everything, I surrender all to you
Right now (Right now)
I give my life to live again (I give my life)
I'll break free, take me (Take me)
My everything (My everything), I surrender all to you (Yeah)

So this is who I am
And this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow
And I will stand for my dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
But you are my only
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead
And I won't let my heart control my head
But you are my only

We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be
Immortality
I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me inside

Fulfill your destiny
Is there within' the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
The king of hearts
The joker's wild

We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
I'll make them all remember me
'Cause I have found a dream that must come true
Every ounce of me must see it through
But you are my only
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me
Immortality, oh, baby
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me inside

We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
With all my love for you
And what else we may do
We don't say goodbye

Take me back, into the arms I love
Need me, like you did before
Touch me once again
And remember when
There was no one that you wanted more
Don't go, you know you'll break my heart
She won't, love you like I will

Here inside my heart
I'm the one who wants to love you more
You will see I can give you

16 ContributorsCourage Lyrics
I would be lying if I said I'm fine
I think of you at least a hundred times
'Cause in the echo of my voice I hear your words
Just like you're there
I still come home from a long day
So much to talk about, so much to say
I love to think that we're still making plans
In conversations that'll never end
In conversations that'll never end

Courage, don't you dare fail me now
I need you to keep away the doubts
I'm staring in the face of something new
You're all I got to hold on to
So, courage, don't you dare fail me now

Not one to hide from the truth, I know
It's outta my hands but I won't let you go
There's no replacing the way you touched me
I still feel the rush
Sometimes it drowns me 'til I can't breathe
Thinking it's only in our memories
But then I talk to you like I did then
In conversations that will never end

Courage, don't you dare fail me now
I need you to keep away the doubts
I'm staring in the face of something new
You're all I got to hold on to
So, courage, don't you dare fail me now

'Cause it's not easy when you're not with me
This world of madness goes faster now
And it's a train wreck, but I won't crash yet
Long as your echo never fades out

Courage, don't you dare fail me now
'Cause it's not easy when you're not with me
This world of madness goes faster now
And it's a train wreck, but I won't crash yet
Long as your echo never fades out
Courage, don't you dare fail me now

[Song 23: Parler à mon père]
14 ContributorsParler à mon père Lyrics
Je voudrais oublier le temps
Pour un soupir, pour un instant
Une parenthèse après la course
Et partir où mon cœur me pousse
Je voudrais retrouver mes traces
Où est ma vie, où est ma place
Et garder l'or de mon passé
Au chaud dans mon jardin secret

Je voudrais passer l'océan
Croiser le vol d'un goéland
Penser à tout ce que j'ai vu
Ou bien aller vers l'inconnu
Je voudrais décrocher la lune
Je voudrais même sauver la Terre
Mais avant tout
Je voudrais parler à mon père
Parler à mon père
Je voudrais choisir un bateau
Pas le plus grand ni le plus beau
Je le remplirais des images
Et des parfums de mes voyages
Je voudrais freiner pour m'asseoir
Trouver au creux de ma mémoire
Des voix de ceux qui m'ont appris
Qu'il n'y a pas de rêve interdit
Je voudrais trouver les couleurs
Des tableaux que j'ai dans le cœur
De ce décor aux lignes pures
Où je vous vois et me rassure
Je voudrais décrocher la lune
Je voudrais même sauver la Terre
Mais avant tout
Je voudrais parler à mon père
Parler à mon père

Je voudrais oublier le temps
Pour un soupir, pour un instant
Une parenthèse après la course
Et partir où mon cœur me pousse
Je voudrais retrouver mes traces
Où est ma vie, où est ma place
Et garder l'or de mon passé
Au chaud dans mon jardin secret

Je voudrais partir avec toi
Je voudrais rêver avec toi
Toujours chercher l'inaccessible
Toujours espérer l'impossible
Je voudrais décrocher la lune
Et pourquoi pas sauver la Terre
Mais avant tout
Je voudrais parler à mon père
Parler à mon père
Je voudrais parler à mon père
Parler à mon père

I want to forget that time exists
For just one shining moment
Take a rest after the race
And go where my heart tells me

I want to reconnect with my roots
Find my path, my place in life
And keep my treasured memories
Hidden in the warmth of my secret garden
I want to swim the ocean wide, spread like an eagle and take flight
Think of everything I've seen and even head into the unknown
I want to capture the moon, maybe even save the world
But above all I want to talk to my father
Talk to my father...
I want to pick out a boat
Not the nicest, not the biggest
I would fill it with all the sights
And smells of my journeys
I want to stop and take a seat
And find within my memory
The voices of those who taught me
To never give up on my dreams
I want to find within my heart, the colours that represent my art
From this decor filled with pure lines, where I see you, which calms my soul
I want to capture the moon, maybe even save the world
But above all, I want to talk to my father
I want to talk to my father...

I want to forget that time exists
For just one shining moment
Take a rest after the race
A go where my heart tells me
I want to reconnect with my roots
Find my path, my place in life
And keep my treasured memories
Hidden away in the warmth of my secret garden
I want to run away with you
I want to dream with you
Always seeking the unattainable
Always hoping for the impossible
I want to capture the moon
And why not save the world
But above all, I want to talk to my father
I want to talk to my father
Talk to my father

The faith of a child
By a part of my heart
I was reckless and wild

I am recovering
The hope that I lost
The part of my soul
That paid the cost

Little by little, day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil, oh
Take back my peace of mind

I am recovering
Anxiety addict
A broken perfectionist
Somewhat erratic

I am recovering
A constant regretter
Hold it against her
At least till forever

Little by little, day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil, oh
Take back my peace of mind

Hold me
As I fall apart, baby
Hold me
Here in the dark
'Cause the old me
Run just as far as I could from my heart

One step at a time

Take back my peace of mind
Tell him I love him, yeah

And in your eyes, I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, "What's his is hers"

I'm falling into you (Falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (Falling into you)
Falling into you

I was afraid (I was afraid) to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
The walls begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground

I'm falling into you (Falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (Falling into you)
Falling into you
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are

Catch me, don't let me drop
Love me, don't ever stop


So close your eyes, and let me kiss you
And while you sleep, I will miss you, oh

I'm falling into you (Falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (Falling into you)
Falling into you
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are

Falling into you

11 ContributorsGoodbye’s (The Saddest Word) Lyrics
Mamma
You gave life to me
Turned a baby into a lady
Mamma
All you had to offer
Was the promise of a lifetime of love

Now I know
There is no other
Love like a mother's love for her child
And I know
A love so complete
Someday must leave
Must say goodbye

Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday, you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye

Mamma
You gave love to me
Turned a young one into a woman
Mamma
All I ever needed
Was a guarantee of you loving me

'Cause I know
There is no other
Love like a mother's love for her child
And it hurts so
That something so strong
Someday will be gone, must say goodbye

Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye

But the love you gave me will always live
You'll always be there every time I fall
You are to me the greatest love of all
You take my weakness and you make me strong
And I will always love you 'til forever comes

And when you need me
I'll be there for you always
I'll be there your whole life through
I'll be there this I promise you, Mamma
I'll be your beacon through the darkest nights
I'll be the wings that guide your broken flight
I'll be your shelter through the raging storm
And I will love you 'till forever comes

Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye

'Till we meet again...
Until then...
Goodbye

Une photo, une date
C'est à n'y pas croire
C'était pourtant hier, mentirait ma mémoire
Et ces visages d'enfants
Et le mien dans ce miroir
Oh, c'est pas pour me plaindre
Ça vous n'avez rien à craindre
La vie m'a tellement gâtée
J'ai plutôt du mal à l'éteindre
Ô mon Dieu, j'ai eu ma part
Et bien plus à tant d'égards

Mais quand on vit trop beau, trop fort
On en oublie le temps qui passe
Comme on perd un peu le nord
Au milieu de trop vastes espaces
À peine le temps de s'y faire
À peine on doit laisser la place
Ô si je pouvais

Encore un soir, encore une heure
Encore une larme de bonheur
Une faveur comme une fleur
Un souffle, une erreur
Un peu de nous, un rien de tout
Pour tout se dire encore ou bien se taire
En regards juste un report
À peine encore, même s'il est tard

J'ai jamais rien demandé
Ça c'est pas la mer à boire
Allez, face à l'éternité
Ça va même pas se voir
Ça restera entre nous
Ô juste un léger retard

Y en a tant qui tuent le temps
Tant et tant qu'ils le perdent ou le passent
Tant qui se mentent inventant les rêves
En des instants de grâce
Ô je donne ma place au paradis
Si l’on m’oublie sur Terre
Encore hier

Encore un soir, encore une heure
Encore une larme de bonheur
Une faveur comme une fleur
Un souffle, une erreur
Un peu de nous, un rien de tout
Pour tout se dire encore
Ou bien se taire en regards
Juste un report
À peine encore, je sais, il est tard

C’est pas grand-chose, rien qu’une pause
Que le temps, les horloges se reposent
Et caresser juste un baiser, un baiser

Encore un soir, encore une heure
Un peu de nous, un rien de tout
Un soir
Encore un soir
Encore une heure
Un peu de nous
Un rien de tout
Un soir

Je rêve son visage, je décline son corps
Et puis je l'imagine habitant mon décor
J'aurais tant à lui dire si j'avais su parler
Comment lui faire lire au fond de mes pensées ?
Mais comment font ces autres à qui tout réussi ?
Qu'on me dise mes fautes, mes chimères aussi
Moi j'offrirais mon âme, mon coeur et tout mon temps
Mais j'ai beau tout donner, tout n'est pas suffisant

S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Si l'on changeait les choses un peu
Rien qu'en aimant donner
S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Je ferais de ce monde un rêve, une éternité

J'ai du sang dans mes songes, un pétale séché
Quand des larmes me rongent que d'autres ont versées
La vie n'est pas étanche, mon île est sous le vent
Les portes laissent entrer les cris même en fermant
Dans un jardin d'enfant, sur un balcon des fleurs
Ma vie paisible où j'entends battre tous les coeurs
Quand les nuages foncent, présages des malheurs
Quelles armes répondent aux pays de nos peurs ?

S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Si l'on changeait les choses un peu
Rien qu'en aimant donner
S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Je ferais de ce monde un rêve, une éternité
S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Si l'on pouvait changer les choses
Et tout recommencer
S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Nous ferions de ce rêve un monde
S'il suffisait d'aimer

13 ContributorsLovers Never Die Lyrics
You said forever after
But what came after that
Wasn't what I expected
I expected you back
You said that you’re romantic
Where's the romance in this?
It's obvious that you’re full of it

I tried to give it time
But then our time slipped away
You said that you'd be fine
But finally I'm awake
You said it's only habit
But what happened is this
It's obvious I'm not having it

You said the pretty things you know I like
But I can read between the lines

If lovers never die then why do I need you?
Believe when I see you
Whenever I see you
It kills me inside
Why'd you say goodbye if lovers never die?

I trust too easily
I trusted you'd treat me well
I’ve faced the truth
But facing you, I’m asking for help
You played the gentleman
But there's no gentle in this
It’s obvious you're full of it

You said the pretty things you know I like
But I can read between the lies

If lovers never die then why do I need you?
Believe when I see you
Whenever I see you
It kills me inside
Why'd you say goodbye if lovers never die?

It was just a lie
But I survived
Why do you say goodbye if lovers never die?
Oo-oo, oh-oh

If lovers never die then why do I need you?
Believe when I see you
Whenever I see you
It kills me inside
Why'd you say goodbye if lovers never die?
Why do you say goodbye if lovers never die?

Maybe I should have called you first

Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night

What in this world keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go, I hear the beating of our one heart
I think about you when the night is cold and dark, uh-huh, yeah
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you, oh

I drove all night to get to you

Du chemin qu'il a fait et de tous ses projets
Je crois pourtant qu'il est seul et qu'il voit d'autres filles (Et qu'il voit d'autres filles)
Je ne sais pas ce qu'elles veulent ni les phrases qu'il dit (Ni les phrases qu'il dit)
Je ne sais pas où je suis, quelque part dans sa vie
Si je compte aujourd'hui plus qu'une autre pour lui
Il est si près de moi, pourtant je ne sais pas comment l'aimer
Lui seul peut décider qu'on se parle d'amour ou d'amitié
Moi je l'aime et je peux lui offrir ma vie
Même s'il ne veut pas de ma vie
Je rêve de ses bras, oui mais je ne sais pas comment l'aimer
Il a l'air d'hésiter entre une histoire d'amour ou d'amitié
Et je suis comme une île en plein océan
On dirait que mon coeur est trop grand
Rien à lui dire, il sait bien que j'ai tout à donner (Que j'ai tout à donner)
Rien qu'à sourire, à l'attendre, à vouloir le gagner (À vouloir le gagner)
Mais qu'elles sont tristes, les nuits, le temps me paraît long
Et je n'ai pas appris à me passer de lui
Il est si près de moi, pourtant je ne sais pas comment l'aimer
Lui seul peut décider qu'on se parle d'amour ou d'amitié
Moi je l'aime et je peux lui offrir ma vie
Même s'il ne veut pas de ma vie

Je rêve de ses bras, oui mais je ne sais pas comment l'aimer
Il a l'air d'hésiter entre une histoire d'amour ou d'amitié
Et je suis comme une île en plein océan
On dirait que mon coeur est trop grand

[Song 33: Perfect Goodbye]
12 ContributorsPerfect Goodbye Lyrics
Forty five steps in the same direction
Oh, ain't it strange we're here connecting?
Don't need to understand if God's got a plan
It's out of our hands anyway

No regrets, this is heaven sent
Look at where we are, it's amazing
And if you need me, I will be in your memory

Goodnight baby, kiss me now, don't make me sad
After midnight promise we'll never look back
This shit is perfect, each second worth it
Let's save this love before we go and hurt it now
Goodnight baby, with stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye

Forty five steps in the same direction
Just take my hand, don't ask no questions
Don't need to understand if God's got a plan
It's out of our hands anyway

No regrets, this is heaven sent
Look at where we are, it's amazing
And if you need me, I will be in your memory

Goodnight baby, kiss me now, don't make me sad
After midnight promise we'll never look back
This shit is perfect, each second worth it
Let's save this love before we go and hurt it now
Goodnight baby, with stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye

'Cause I don't wanna be here without you
I'd rather just bottle time
Open up the memory and keep you by my side
I can't believe that I ever found you
Baby, take a look around
Everything is perfect now

So goodnight baby, kiss me now, don't make me sad
After midnight promise we'll never look back
This shit is perfect, each second worth it
Let's save this love before we go and hurt it now
Goodnight baby, with stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye
With stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye
This is the perfect goodbye

[Song 34: Falling in Love Again]
12 ContributorsFalling in Love Again Lyrics
When the sun went down on that day
I never thought that love would come back to me
When I closed my eyes and tried to dream
Darkness was the only thing I could see

I had run out of hope
Reached the end of the road
Hit the rocks at the bottom with no farther to go
But just when I thought I was destined to end up all alone
You showed me there's more to this life

I can’t believe I'm falling in love once again
I can't believe I’m falling in love, but I am
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can't believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love once again

When you take my hand you hold my heart
And I know everything will be alright
When you touch me there I feel it everywhere
I'm loving things I never thought I would like

I can't believe I'm falling in love once again
I can’t believe I’m falling in love, but I am
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can’t believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love
Once again, oh whoa

Just when I thought I was destined to end up all alone
You showed me there's more to this life

I can’t believe I'm falling in love once again (Oh, I'm falling in love once again)
(I can't believe I'm falling in love, but I am)
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can't believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love
Once again

Oh-oh-ooh
Once again
Mm-mmm

9 ContributorsFor the Lover That I Lost Lyrics
Think about your lips and the way they kiss
There's so much I really miss about you
Sittin' on the beach, you were still in reach
And I haven't felt free without you

All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were, my love, is tragic
And you're the last thing that I need

So I lay a dozen roses
For the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices
Even though I pay the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses
I lay them there, I lay them there for you
Oh

You've been on my mind every single night
I can't visualize life without you
I've been tryin' to go a week without losing sleep
But there's something that I need to go through

All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were, my love, is tragic
And you're the last thing that I need

So I lay a dozen roses
For the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices
Even though I pay the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses
I lay them there, I lay them there for you
Ooh, I lay them there for you, hmm-ooh-ooh

For the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices
Even though I pay the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses
I lay them there, I lay them there for you

O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees

O hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
O night, O night divine!

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains He shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in His name, all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord!
Their name forever praise we

Everywhere I go all the places that I've been
Every smile is a new horizon on a land I've never seen
There are people around the world - different faces different names
But there's one true emotion that reminds me we're the same...
Lets talk about love
From the laughter of a child to the tears of a grown man
There's a thread that runs right through us all and helps us understand
As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker to a flame
From the very first sweet melody to the very last refrain

Let's talk about love
Let's talk about us
Let's talk about life
Let's talk about trust
Let's talk about love

It's the king of all who live and the queen of good hearts
It's the ace you may keep up your sleeve - until the name is all but lost
As deep as any sea - with the rage of any storm
But as gentle as a falling leaf on any autumn morn...

Let's talk about love - it's all were needing
Let's talk about us - it's the air we're breathing
Let's talk about life - I wanna know you
Let's talk about trust - and I wanna show you
Let's talk about love

Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?

The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning, learning, learning), I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning, turning, turning), round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on, yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly my friends

The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on, yeah yeah

I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show
Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
(On with the)
(On with the) show
The show must go on

Couldn't leave, couldn't leave
Felt the night sky closing in
Closing in on me
Couldn't scream, couldn't dream
Only nightmares pity me
Couldn't sleep for the darkness closing in
Closing in on me

Kiss your face 'til there's no more to say
I'll hold you near
I'll hold you near to me

[Song 43: Love Doesn’t Ask Why]
5 ContributorsLove Doesn’t Ask Why Lyrics
Love doesn't ask why
It speaks from the heart
And never explains
Don't you know that love doesn't think twice?
It can come all at once
Or whisper from a distance

Don't ask me if this feeling's right or wrong
It doesn't have to make much sense
It just has to be this strong
'Cause when you're in my arms I understand
We don't have a voice
When our hearts make the choices
There's no plan
It's not in our hands

Love doesn't ask why
Speaks from the heart
And never explains
Don't you know that love doesn't think twice?
It can come all at once
Or whisper from a distance

Now I can feel what you're afraid to say
If you give your soul to me
Will you give too much away?
But we can't let this moment pass us by
Can't question this chance
Or expect any answers
We can try
Maybe we can try

Love doesn't ask why (Doesn't ask you why)
Speaks from the heart
And never explains
Don't you know that love doesn't think twice?
It can come all at once
Or whisper from a distance

So let's take what we found
And wrap it around us

Love doesn't ask you why
Speaks from the heart
Don't you know
Don't you know that love...

Baby

Love doesn't ask why (Love doesn't ask you why)
Speaks from the heart
(And never explains)
(Don't you know that love, love, love) love doesn't think twice?
It comes all at once
Whisper from a distance

Love doesn't ask you why

12 ContributorsI Love You, Goodbye LyricsThe song was written by prolific American songwriter Diane Warren. It was not released as a commercial single, but it became popular in different countries.
Wish I could be the one, the one who could give you love
The kind of love you really need
Wish I could say to you that I'll always stay with you
But baby, that's not me
You need someone willing to give their heart and soul to you
Promise you forever, baby, that's something I can't do

Oh, I could say that I'll be all you need
But that would be a lie

I know I'd only hurt you
I know I'd only make you cry
I'm not the one you're needing
I love you, goodbye

I hope someday you can find someway to understand
I'm only doing this for you
I don't really want to go but deep in my heart I know
This is the kindest thing to do
You'll find someone who'll be the one that I could never be
Who'll give you something better than the love you'll find with me

Oh, I could say that I'll be all you need
But that would be a lie

I know I'd only hurt you
I know I'd only make you cry
I'm not the one you're needing
I love you, goodbye

Leaving someone when you love someone
Is the hardest thing to do
When you love someone as much as I love you
Oh, I don't wanna leave you
Baby, it tears me up inside
But I'll never be the one you're needing
I love you, goodbye

Baby, it's never gonna work out
I love you, goodbye

Close the door
Shut the world away
All the fight's gone from this wounded heart
Across the floor
Dreams and shadows play
Like wind blown refugees

Call the man
Who deals in love beyond repair
He can heal the world
Of hearts in need of care
Shine a light ahead
When the next step is unclear
Call the man
He's needed here

I close my eyes
I remember when
Your sweet love filled this empty room
The tears I cry
Won't bring it back again
Unless the lonely star should fall

Call the man
Who deals in love beyond repair
He can heal the world
Of hearts in need of care
Shine a light ahead
When the next step is unclear
Call the man
He's needed here

Needed in the chaos and confusion
From the plains to city hall
Needed where the proud who walk the wire are set to fall


Call the man
Who deals in once upon a time
Maybe he
Can mend this broken heart of mine
Shine a light ahead
Now the future isn't clear, isn't clear
Call the man
He's needed here

Call the man
He's needed here
He's needed here
He's needed here
Call the man

He's needed here
Right here right now

11 ContributorsThe Hard Way Lyrics
I been, I been, I been
I been touching fires for the sake of feelin'
I been chasing,  chasing
Chasing all these highs so I could crash the ceiling
I been restless, tempted to follow every devil way down
I took it so low and at the time, it looked like no way out

I had to see
Try to believe
I write my story and this ain't how it's ending
Said to myself, said to myself
"This ain't how I'm gonna go down"

When the bottom hit my soul
I had to climb up all alone
When the night shut down my hope
I had to find a light to hold
You gotta break just a little, die just a little
To come alive in the right way
And sometimes to get home you gotta go
The hard way, hard way

Turnin', turnin', turnin'
Turnin' every corner 'cause my heart was yearning
For something more than 4 AM
Messed up in bed, no, I don't miss that feeling
I don't see a reason
Chasing love down a dead end
But see the truth is
I wouldn't know that unless I did

I had to see
Try to believe
I write my story and this ain't how it's ending
Said to myself, said to myself
"This ain't how I'm gonna go down"

When the bottom hit my soul
I had to climb up all alone
When the night shut down my hope
I had to find a light to hold
You gotta break just a little, die just a little
To come alive in the right way
And sometimes to get home you gotta go
The hard way

I wouldn't know what I'm made of
If I took the easy way out (I took the easy way out)
As long as it took me to get here
The hard times were worth what I found (I found)
I wouldn't know what I'm made of (I wouldn't know)
If I took the easy way out (I took the easy way out)
As long as it took me to get here  (To get here)
The hard times were worth what I found

When the bottom hit my soul
I had to climb up all alone
When the night shut down my hope
I had to find a light to hold
You gotta break just a little, die just a little
To come alive in the right way
And sometimes to get home you gotta go
The hard way

[Song 48: Dance With My Father]
6 ContributorsDance With My Father Lyrics
Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then

Spin me around ‘til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again
Ooh, ooh, yeah

When I and my mother would disagree
To get my way, I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah yeah
Then finally make me do just what my mama said

Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step, one final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
'Cause I'd love, love, love, love
To dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how my mama cried for him
I pray for her even more than me
I pray for her even more than me
Mmm-mmm, ooh yeah...

I know I'm praying for much too much
But could You send back the only man she loved?
I know You don't do it usually
But, dear Lord, she's dying
To dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah
I know You don't do it usually
But, dear Lord, she's dying
To dance with my father again

Can we touch the soul of heaven?
Can we unite a sacred lesson?
Every child creates a skylight of beauty
Can you hear cathedrals falling?
All the universe is calling
Cry a single cello from your heart

Since the world has lost her way
Loneliness journey endlessly
Yet the promised chance remains
Gifts of what could be

So let the children remember the sun
Let them dance let them soar
For their lives have begun
Let the children engender the rain
As the river runs through fields
Forever subsiding their pain
Prayer

Every voice along the shoreline
Standing still within time
Spinning unresolved, the walking
As each season passes
Through wonderland and looking glasses
The secret garden shines, beckons you

Gentle flower, don't fade away
Sweet innocent still harbours thee
In faith of golden dreams
Where one love lives eternally

Let the children remember the sun
Let them dance let them soar
For their lives have begun
Let the children engender the rain
As the river runs through fields
Forever subsiding their pain
Prayer

Prayer
Prayer

Bless the children for they are the light
They are the truth of spirit in flight
Yes, the children engender the rain
As the river runs through life
Healing their pain
If you could trust with your heart but for time
Sweet angel conceived, you have
Forever and always believed
Prayer

Ohhh (Prayer, prayer)

On ne change pas
On met juste les costumes d'autres sur soi
On ne change pas
Une veste ne cache qu'un peu

On pousse un peu, tout juste
Le temps d'un rêve, d'un songe
Et les toucher du doigt

Mais on n'oublie pas
L'enfant qui reste, presque nu
Les instants d'innocence
Quand on ne savait pas

On ne change pas
On attrape des airs et des poses de combat
On ne change pas
On se donne le change, on croit
Que l'on fait des choix
Mais si tu grattes là
Tout près de l'apparence tremble
Un petit qui nous ressemble
On sait bien qu'il est là
On l'entend parfois
Sa rengaine insolente
Qui s'entête et qui répète

Oh ne me quitte pas
On n'oublie jamais
On a toujours un geste
Qui trahit qui l'on est
Un prince, un valet
Sous la couronne un regard
Une arrogance, un trait
D'un prince ou d'un valet
Je sais tellement ça
J'ai copié des images
Et des rêves que j'avais
Tous ces milliers de rêves
Mais si près de moi
Une petite fille maigre
Marche à Charlemagne, inquiète
Et me parle tout bas

On ne change pas, on met juste
Les costumes d'autres et voilà
On ne change pas, on ne cache
Qu'un instant de soi

Une petite fille
Ingrate et solitaire, marche
Et rêve dans les neiges
En oubliant le froid
Si je la maquille
Elle disparaît un peu
Le temps de me regarder faire
Et se moquer de moi

Une petite fille
Une toute petite fille
Une toute petite fille
Une toute petite fille

[Song 52: Change My Mind]
10 ContributorsChange My Mind Lyrics
We were bold, we were dust, we were energy
We were more in the light than we'd ever be
Effortless dancing with symmetry
And the memory's more or less killing me

All of my sirens
Running to your fire
Don't fight it

Change my mind
Make me drunk on you again
Turn back time
Don’t you wonder where I’ve been?

Are you ever gonna change my mind? (Are you ever?)
Change my mind (Are you?)
I've been waiting for you, change my mind (Are you ever?)
Change my mind (Are you?)

Chant my name, chant the words to my dying day
But I just seem to keep pushing you away
And it’s all I can do as an optimist
To look out on the shore for our lonely ship

All of my sirens
Running to your fire
Can't fight it

Change my mind
Make me drunk on you again
Take back time
Don’t you wonder where I’ve been?

Are you ever gonna change my mind? (Are you ever?)
Change my mind (Are you?)
I've been waiting for you, change my mind (Are you ever?)
Change my mind (Are you ever?)


Change my mind (Are you ever?)
Make me drunk on you again (Are you?)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Are you ever?)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Are you ever? Are you ever? Are you ever?)
Change my mind (Are you ever?)
Make me drunk on you again (Are you? Are you ever?)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Are you ever? Are you ever?)

We were bold, we were dust, we were energy
We were more in the light than we'd ever be

[Song 53: The Reason]
15 ContributorsThe Reason Lyrics
I figured it out
I was high and low and everything in between
I was wicked and wild, baby, you know what I mean
Till there was you, yeah, you
Something went wrong
I made a deal with the devil for an empty I.O.U
Been to hell and back, but an angel was looking through
It was you, yeah, you
It's all because of you

You are the reason
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
You are the reason, the reason

In the middle of the night (In the middle of the night)
I'm going down 'cause I adore you
I want to floor you
I'm giving it up
No more running around spinning my wheel
You came out of my dream and you made it real
I know what I feel
It's you
It's all because of you

You are the reason
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
You are the reason, the reason

In the middle of the night (In the middle of the night)
I'm going down 'cause I want you
I want to touch you
I want to floor you
You are the reason, baby


You are the reason, baby
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
You are the reason, the reason
You are the reason
(You are the only reason)
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
You are the reason
The reason
The reason
The reason

Because of you
Don't you know

9 ContributorsFly LyricsFly, fly little wing
Fly beyond imagining
The softest cloud, the whitest dove
Upon the wind of heaven's love
Past the planets and the stars
Leave this lonely world of ours
Escape the sorrow and the pain
And fly again
Fly, fly precious one
Your endless journey has begun
Take your gentle happiness
Far too beautiful for this
Cross over to the other shore
There is peace forevermore
But hold this mem'ry bittersweet
Until we meet
Fly, fly do not fear
Don't waste a breath, don't shed a tear
Your heart is pure, your soul is free
Be on your way, don't wait for me
Above the universe you'll climb
On beyond the hands of time
The moon will rise, the sun will set
But I won't forget

Fly, fly little wing
Fly where only angels sing
Fly away, the time is right
Go now, find the light

[Song 55: If Walls Could Talk]
9 ContributorsIf Walls Could Talk Lyrics
Can you keep a secret?

These walls keep a secret
That only we know
But how long can they keep it
Cause we're two lovers who lose control
We're two shadows chasing rainbows
Behind closed windows
Behind closed doors

If walls could talk - oh
They would say "I want you more"
They would say "hey - never felt like this before"
And that you would always be
The one for me

Two people making memories
Just too good to tell
And these arms are never empty
When we're lying where we fell
We're painting pictures, making magic, taking chances
Making love

If walls could talk - oh
They would say "I want you more"
They would say "hey - never felt like this before"
And that you would always be
The one for me

If walls could talk - my
They would see the love inside
They would see - me
In your arms in ecstasy
And with every move they'd know
I love you so

I love you so

When I'm feeling weak
You give me wings
When the fire has no heat
You light it up again
When I hear no violins
You play my every string

So stop the press
Hold the news
The secret's safe between me and you
Walls - can you keep a secret?

If walls could talk - oh
They would say "I want you more"
They would say "hey - never felt like this before"
And that you would always be
The one for me

If walls could talk - my
They would see the love inside
They would see - me
In your arms in ecstasy
And with every move they'd know
I love you so

I love you so
Oh I love you so baby
Oh baby
Love you, love you, love you, love you so honey
Love you, love you, love you so
In your arms in ecstasy
If they could see you and me, only you and me baby
Just you and me baby
Oh
Oh baby

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
It's the season to be jolly
And be thankful for all that we have
All the lights and decorations
Put up in the anticipation
Of the joyful celebration
That's on its way
We're counting the days
Until it's time for Christmas day

Oh and God bless us everyone
The good and the bad
The happy; the sad
Oh and God bless us everyone
Here's to family and friends
It's good to be here again

On the streets there's children laughing
People smile as they are passing
Christmas time is here, our waiting is done
Wishing it could last forever
Not just twelve days in December
Through the year let's try to remember
That special way
That everyone feels
It's the magic of Christmas day

Oh and God bless us everyone
The good and the bad
The happy; the sad

And through the eyes of girls and boys
Share their wonder, live through their joy

The spirit will come to you

The good and the bad
The happy; the sad
Oh and God bless us everyone
Here's to family and friends
It's good to be here again

Et les toits grattent le ciel
Les eaux des torrents sont violence
Et les neiges sont éternelles
Chez moi les loups sont à nos portes
Et tous les enfants les comprennent
On entend les cris de New York
Et les bateaux sur la Seine
Va pour tes forêts tes loups tes gratte-ciel
Va pour les torrents tes neiges éternelles
J’habite où tes yeux brillent où ton sang coule
Où des bras me serrent
J’irai où tu iras, mon pays sera toi
J’irai où tu iras qu’importe la place
Qu’importe l’endroit
Je veux des cocotiers des plages
Et des palmiers sous le vent
Le feu du soleil au visage
Et le bleu des océans
Je veux des chameaux des mirages
Et des déserts envoûtants
Des caravanes et des voyages comme sur les dépliants

Va pour tes cocotiers tes rivages
Va pour tes lagons tout bleu balançant
J’habite où l’amour est un village
Là où l’on m’attend
J’irai où tu iras, mon pays sera toi
J’irai où tu iras, qu’importe la place
Qu’importe l’endroit
Prends tes clic et tes clac et tes rêves et ta vie
Tes mots, tes tabernacles et ta langue d’ici
L’escampette et la poudre et la fille de l’air
Montre-moi tes édens montre-moi tes enfers
Tes nord et puis tes sud et tes zestes d’ouest
Chez moi les forêts se balancent
Et les toits grattent le ciel
Les eaux des torrents sont violence
Et les neiges sont éternelles
Chez moi les loups sont à nos portes
Et tous les enfants les comprennent
On entend les cris de New York
Et les bateaux sur la Seine
Qu’importe j’irai où bon te semble
J’aime tes envies j’aime ta lumière
Tous le paysages te ressemblent
Quand tu les éclaires

J’irai où tu iras, mon pays sera toi
J’irai où tu iras qu’importe la place

7 ContributorsThe Power of the Dream Lyrics
Deep within each heart
There lies a magic spark
That lights the fire of our imagination
And since the dawn of man
The strength of just I can
Has brought together people of all nations
There's nothing ordinary in the living of each day
There's a special part every one of us will play

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
To bring us closer to the power of the dream

As the world gives us its best
To stand apart from all the rest
It is the power of the dream that brings us here

Your mind will take you far
The rest is just your heart
You'll find your fate is all your own creation
And every boy and girl as they come into this world
Bring the gift of hope and inspiration

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
To bring us closer to the power of the dream

The world unites in hope and peace
We pray that it will always be
It is the power of the dream that brings us here
There's so much strength in all of us
Every woman, child, and man
It's the moment that you think you can't
You'll discover that you can

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
To bring us closer to the power of the dream
Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
To bring us closer to the power of the dream

The power of the dream
Faith in things unseen
Courage to embrace your fears
No matter where you are
To reach for your own star

To realize the power of the dream
To realize the power of the dream

[Song 60: Love Again]
6 ContributorsLove Again Lyrics
Rising tides, tears you cry every night seem never-ending
But that's just life, the last goodbye, high and dry, it leaves you empty

You might think your world is ending, but it won't
You might think you need to give up, but you don't

'Cause you don't have to move a mountain, just keep moving
Every move is a new emotion
And you don't have to find the answers, just keep trying
The sun will rise again
The storms subside again
This is not the end
And you will love again

Summer rain, day by day, sadness fades, the wound is healing
And time goes by, eyes will dry and you will find someone to heal with

You might think your world is ending, but it won't
You might think you need to give up, but you don't

'Cause you don't have to move a mountain, just keep moving
Every move is a new emotion
And you don't have to find the answers, just keep trying
The sun will rise again
The storms subside again
This is not the end
And you will love again

Woah, you will love again, again, love again
You will love again, again, love again

'Cause you don't have to move a mountain, just keep moving
Every move is a new emotion
And you don't have to find the answers, just keep trying
The sun will rise again
The storms subside again
No, this is not the end
And you will love, you will love, you will love again

Dans sa tête ya que d'la musique
Il vend des disques dans une boutique
On dirait qu'il vit
Dans une autre galaxie

Tous les soirs, il m'emmène danser
Dans des endroits très très gais
Où il a des tas d'amis
Oui, je sais, il aime les garçons
Je devrais me faire une raison
Essayer de l'oublier... mais

Treat her like a lady!
Oh, ya mean, I'll show ya man, Celine!
Run, run, run
Go, what goes around comes around, go!
What goes around comes around, go!
What goes around comes around go, go!
Hear this

All the girl could want was a little attention
From a man who's strong and not to mention
Kiss and caressing her all night long
But all that boy wants is to hit and run off
He and his friends-they sit and they laugh
Going around talking 'bout the girls they used in the past

You gotta get what’s coming to you
For all the bad bad things you do to your

Lady, treat her like a lady
You’ll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat her like a lady
Lady, treat her like a lady
You’ll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat her like a lady

Go, what goes around comes around, go, go!
Hear it

She stopped going to church, she don't wanna go to school
She left with anger when he took her for a fool
Even though her friends tell her to just keep cool
Didn't tell her from the start just what he had planned
Right in her face with another woman
Now she's in jail for attacking her man

You gotta get what’s coming to you
For all the bad bad things you do to your

Lady, treat her like a lady
You'll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat her like a
Lady, treat her like a lady
You'll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat her like a lady

(Treat her like a lady)
Ohhhhhhhhhhh, whoo!

Go, what goes around comes around, go!
What goes around comes around, go!
What goes around comes around, go, go!
Ba ba da ba ba, whoo!

Tell it to her straight, she can take the truth
Don't lead her on and leave her confused
Anyone would rather be alone than be used
Don't sit and think you'll hurt her feelings
She only wants to know just what the deal is
Next time beware of who's heart your breaking

Lady, treat her like a lady
You’ll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat her like a lady
Lady, treat her like a lady
You’ll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat her like a lady

You're gonna get what's comin' to you
For all the bad bad things you do to your

Lady, treat her like a lady
You'll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat her like a
Lady, treat her like a lady
You'll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat her like a lady

I have lived and died
What I wouldn't do just to be with you
I know I must forget you to go on
I can't hold back my tears too long
Though life won't be the same

And find the strength I need to let you go

Just walk away
Just say goodbye
Don't turn around now
You may see me cry
I mustn't fall apart
Or show my broken heart
Or the love I feel for you

So walk away
Close the door
And let my life be as it was before
I'll never never know
Just how I let you go
There's nothing left to say
Just walk away

There'll never be a moment I'll regret
I've loved you since the day we met

And all the love we made

Si rien de moins que le meilleur ne le satisfait pour toi

A deux on franchit des montagnes

Avec ses trompettes et ses guerres

Tu peux dire un grand merci a la vie
Puisqu'elle a fait de lui
Un frere que tu choisis
Et le compagnon de la chance

And maybe this is going too fast
And maybe it's not meant to last

So much to believe in, we were lost in time
Everything I needed I fell into your eyes
Always thought of keeping your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder, come and rescue me
Driven by the hunger of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?
Where do all the lonely hearts go?


Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside

I need someone to give my heart to
Feel it getting stronger and stronger and stronger
And I feel inside
Hearts are made to last
'Til the end of time

It's not easy when the road is your driver
Honey, that's a heavy load that we bear
But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime

I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew oh never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day

How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight,oh

And I was going to tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown

I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

Can't go back to being on my own
Can't help feeling, darlin', since I've found you

I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me, darlin'
I said I needed, needed to be free

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you

Asked me to, I will give my world to you, baby
I need you now (I need you now)
Asked me to, and I'll do anything (Anything)
For you, baby

Everything, everything, baby

I couldn't ask what you do to me
If you asked me to

We are the ones that walk to fire
And people say, "Don't touch," yeah, people say, "Don't touch"
We are the ones that never listen
We can't get burned enough, we can’t get burned enough

And there's no boundaries
Can ever hurt you, you can never hurt me
And we're so unique for falling in love and letting love be

You've got to take me to that place
You let your guard down, yeah, you let your guard down, yeah
If you don't take me all the way
We'll let the world down, no, can't let the world down, no

And there's no boundaries

[Song 71: Look at Us Now]
11 ContributorsLook at Us Now Lyrics
Hard to look at pictures on the wall
Hard to pick the phone up when you call
Hardly talking anymore 'cause a single word could start a war
Once upon a time we had it all

Who would’ve known the future wasn't for us?
Fools, we got it wrong
Thinking that we lead on love
But look at us now
Look at us now

How can we hold it together
When we're falling apart?
Can’t put my finger on the when, the why, the how
How can we see to forever
When we're lost in the dark?
You know it's killing me to say it out loud
Oh, look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground

Back to back, we sleep on separate sides
Back and forth, we slowly lose our minds
Backing out the driveway feels like this goodbye could be for real
Oh, once upon a time time was on our side

Who would've known the future wasn't for us?
Fools, we got it wrong, so wrong

How can we hold it together
When we're falling apart?
Can't put my finger on the when, the why, the how
How can we see to forever
When we're lost in the dark?
You know it’s killing me to say it out loud
Oh, look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground
And you can’t even look at me now
Oh baby, look at us now

Who would've known the future wasn’t for us?
Fools, we got it wrong
Thinking that we lead on love
But look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground

With everything politically correct
Just wanna lock myself away, leave me alone
Gonna lay it all out on my hairbrush microphone

I wanna sit like nobody's listening

7 ContributorsSay Yes Lyrics
You push your love away
When it throws you a rope
You keep turning the pages
'Cause you're losing hope

You always put a cap on your fire
You think that everyone is a liar
You gotta let that thinking go
Stop saying, "No, no, no"

Say "Yes" once more
You deserve to feel that rush again
Say "Yes" once more
Let it touch you like it did back then
Remember the good times
Let go of the pain
Say "Yes"

When he wants to talk
You got nothing to say
When he turns and smiles at you
You turn away

You always put a cap on your fire
Always holding back your desire
You gotta let your feelings show
Stop saying, "No, no, no"

Say "Yes" once more
You deserve to feel that rush again
Say "Yes" once more
Let it touch you like it did back then
Oh, remember the good times
Let go of the pain

Say "Yes" (Say "Yes")

[Song 76: I Will Be Stronger]
8 ContributorsI Will Be Stronger Lyrics
You were always stronger than me
The first in the deep end but then the first to leave
And I have missed you so heavily
But the weight's kind of lifting, I'm seeing colors in the street
And though I might have been lonely or lost
I don't feel like giving up just because you climbed off

And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger
I didn't ask to be set free
But in my hour of weakness, I found a sweetness
'Cause sometimes love must die to be born again
One step up a road is not the end

Was just a moment, no souvenirs
No ink in my shoulder, but, honey, you were here
And I know love wins over pride
I won't outstay my welcome, but love is on my side

And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger
I didn't ask to be set free
But in my hour of weakness, I found a sweetness
'Cause sometimes love must die to be born again
One step up this road, it's not the end

And I know we said forever
And I know you left your mark
But you gave me a life worth living

And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger
I didn't ask to be set free
But in my hour of weakness, I found a sweetness
'Cause sometimes love must die to be born again
One step up this road, it's not the end

It's not the end
It's not the end

Paint my soul to be with you
I'll sketch your lips in shaded tones
Draw your mouth to my own
I'll draw your arms around my waist
Then all doubt I shall erase
I'll paint the rain that softly lands
On your wind-blown hair
I'll trace a hand to wipe your tears
A look to calm your fears
A silhouette of dark and light
While we hold each other oh so tight

I'll paint a sun to warm your heart
Swearing that we'll never part
That's the colour of my love

I'll paint the truth
Show how I feel
Try to make you completely real
I'll use a brush so light and fine
To draw you close and make you mine

I'll paint a sun to warm your heart
Swearing that we'll never ever part
That's the colour of my love

I'll draw the years all passing by
So much to learn so much to try

And with this ring our lives will start
Swearing that we'll never part
I offer what you cannot buy
Devoted love until we die

And it gets deeper, let me say

Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around?

No, I'll never let you down

And it gets bigger, baby, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter, baby, as it grows

And do I love you? My, oh, my

This is from the heart
Ready to let my guard down whatever the cost
Keepin' it safe, you just can't love outside the box
So I'm gonna try my luck on you

Who still believed that there was someone in the world
To take her at her best and her worst
Won't give up when it hurts
So I'm gonna try my luck
I'm gonna try my luck, baby
I'm gonna try my luck on you

'Cause I wish you, I wish you'd stay
'Cause there's something about the chase
That's got you running through my mind all day
And I can't keep up
'Cause I'm still reveling in the rush of the chase

This is for the one
Always walking the beat of their own drum
Ain't afraid to take it as it comes
Yeah, you wanna try your luck
Did you wanna try your luck on me?

'Cause I wish you, I wish you would stay
'Cause there's something about the chase
That's got you running through my mind all day
And I can't keep up
'Cause I'm still reveling in the rush of the chase

I might run but won't walk away
If you keep making my heart race 'til I can't keep up
I'll be reveling in the rush of the chase

I wish you would
Keep me running, running, running
Searching for that something, something
I think it could have been
You and me

So stay
'Cause there's something about the chase
That's got you running through my mind all day
And I can't keep up
'Cause I'm still reveling in the rush
I wish you, I wish you'd stay
I might run but won't walk away
You keep making my heart race 'til I can't keep up
I'll be reveling in the rush of the chase

Traverser des mers, je saurais faire
Défier des machines, narguer des lois
Les foudres divines, ça m'effraie pas
J'sais prendre un coup, le rendre aussi
River des clous, ça j'ai appris

Mais la vie sans toi, je sais pas

J'en sais la violence, son goût de sang
Rouges colères, sombres douleurs
Je sais ces guerres, j'en n'ai pas peur
Je sais me défendre, j'ai bien appris
On n'est pas des tendres par ici
Je sais les hivers, je sais le froid
Mais la vie sans toi, je sais pas
Lutte après lutte, pire après pire
Chaque minute, j'ai cru tenir
J'voudrais apprendre jour après jour
Mais qui commande à nos amours?

More than I want to
Spinning me around in this web
Getting in my heart and my head
Hanging on every word
Pretending they go unheard
Wish you didn't make me so weak
Every time I hear you speak

But you do

Tell me, who let you in? Shook all my confidence
How did you get here? (How did you? How did you?)

Can't fight this feeling
My heart's too revealing
Even though it's making me a fool
Can't tell love when to strike, who to choose
You're the one pulling me close
You're the one that I need the most
I wish you didn't make me so weak
Every time you're next to me

But you do
Yes, you do

Et tout ce que je crois

Je prie la terre, de toute ma voix
Et toi le ciel, nous oublie pas
Je prie les hommes, je prie les rois
D'être plus homme, d'être moins roi
Je prie les yeux, les yeux défaits
Ce que les cieux, ne voient jamais

Qu'on imagine et qu'on se bouge
Et sans trop compter sur là-haut
Savant poète, je prie pour toi

You don't think of the devil who's inside
And maybe it'll come one day
When you'll feel safe and I won't have the time

You'll hear what you wanna hear
Blink once, I could disappear
Some rules to the game will make it
Right for both of us
Just say what you wanna say
I've got it to give away
We both wanna make it last
So keep your eyes on me
Your eyes on me

It's not an illusion that you're the one
And I have fallen deep
I said right from the start
When we're apart, you must only think of me

Temptation is all around
Take good care of what you've found
That's why when I turn around
You better keep
You better keep your eyes on me
No matter what you think I need
No matter what you once believed
If you're mine
So you better say

Yeah
No matter what you think of me
No, it doesn't really matter what you once believed
(Say yeah)
I wanna be the air you breathe
Yeah, you better be everything you said you'd be
(So you better say yeah)
I'm gonna be the only one
We can't go on
No matter what you think of me
You better keep your eyes on me

And say that you want me
Open up your heart
Even if it's hard
Say that you need me
Then let him know
Baby, don't put on a show
Say that you need me
Tell 'em how you feel
Let 'em know it's real
And if you love me
Never turn your back
Gonna keep my eyes on that


Temptation is all around (on that)
Take good care of what you've found
That's why when I turn around
You better keep
You better keep your eyes on me
No matter what you think I need
No matter what you once believed
If you're mine, so you better say yeah
(No matter what you think I need)
(No it doesn't really matter what you once believed)
(say yeah)
I wanna be the air you breathe
Yeah you better be everything you said you'd be (you better keep)
I've gotta be the only one  (yeah you better keep)
We can't go on (your eyes on me)
No matter what you think of me
You better keep your eyes on me
Your eyes on me
Your eyes on me

Lyin' in my bed
Thoughts in my head
Visions of you
But I can't get through the night
So I pick up the phone
I know you're home
You're playin' with my heart
And you know that it just ain't right

It's just a game of love, love, love
And even though it's hard baby
I can never give you up

You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I can't live without your love
Tonight
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for
Inside
Of you, I'm dreamin' of you

So I got in the car
But I didn't get far
'Cause the radio played
Every song that I sang with you
Yesterday's gone
And it may be true
But you know that
I'll never get over you

It's just a game of love, love, love
And even though it hurts me baby
I can never give you up

'Cause you're the one I'm dreamin' of
I can't live without your love
Tonight
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for
Inside
Of you, I'm dreamin' of you

You, you gave me love
Love gave us hope and strength
To carry on and
You, you gave me faith
When I was fallin' down
You would pick me up, my love


You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I can't live without your love
Tonight
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for
Inside
Baby, baby, baby, baby
You're the one I'm dreamin' of (I'm deamin' of)
I can't live without your love
Tonight (Tonight)
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for
Inside (Inside)
Baby
I'm dreamin' of you

Just pick up the phone
I know you're home

5 ContributorsMiracle Lyrics
You're my life's one Miracle
Everything I've done that's good
And you break my heart with tenderness
And I confess it's true
I never knew a love like this till you
You're the reason I was born
Now I finally know for sure
And I'm overwhelmed with happiness
So blessed to hold you close
The one that I love most
With all the future has so much for you in store
Who could ever love you more?
The nearest thing to heaven
You're my angel from above
Only God creates such perfect love
When you smile at me, I cry
And to save your life I'll die
With a romance that is pure heart
You are my dearest part
Whatever it requires
I live for your desires
Forget my own, needs will come before
Who could ever love you more?
Well there is nothing you could ever do
To make me stop, loving you
And every breath I take
Is always for your sake
You sleep inside my dreams and know for sure
Who could ever love you more?

6 ContributorsMy Heart Will Go On (Dialogue Mix) Lyrics
Rose, you're the most amazingly astounding
Wonderful girl, woman, that I've ever known
I'm not an idiot, I know how the world works
But I'm too involved now
You jump, I jump, remember?

Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls
Wearing this
Alright
Wearing only this

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'till
We're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life, we'll always
Go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on (Why does the heart go on?)
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Go on, I'll get the next one
No, not without you
I'll be alright, listen, I'll be fine
I'm a survivor, alright? Don't worry about me
Now go on, get on

You're here
There's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay
Forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You must promise me that you won't give up
No matter what happens
Promise me now, Rose
I promise
And never let go that promise
I will never let go, Jack
I'll never let go

The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn

My love, we have seen it all
The endless confession, the rise and fall
As fragile as a child
But lately I'm sorry I can't hold a smile

But I stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
How did you know I'd take the time for you?
Did you know that I would see you through?
How did you know that I would play the part?
I must've made it clear right from the start

My love, can you give me strength?
Somehow I forgot how to ease my pain
I know I'm right where I belong
Something from nothing never proved me wrong

But I stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
How did you know I take the time for you?
Did you know that I would see you through?
How did you know that I would play the part?
I must've made it clear right from the start

I would share my whole life with you
Would you do the same for me?
I would give all I am to you
Would you do the same for me?

And I will stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
You could you see?
I could break
Did you notice all my mistakes?
There were times I could feel you read my mind
How did you know I'd take the time for you?
And did you know that I could see right through?
Did you know that I would play the part?
I know I made it clear right from the start

Chez moi les forêts se balancent
Et les toits grattent le ciel
Les eaux des torrents sont violence
Et les neiges sont éternelles
Chez moi les loups sont à nos portes
Et tous les enfants les comprennent
On entend les cris de New York
Et les bateaux sur la Seine

Va pour tes forêts, tes loups, tes gratte-ciels
Va pour les torrents, tes neiges éternelles
J'habite où tes yeux brillent, où ton sang coule
Où des bras me serrent

J'irai où tu iras, mon pays sera toi
J'irai où tu iras, qu'importe la place
Qu'importe l'endroit

Je veux des cocotiers, des plages
Et des palmiers sous le vent
Le feu du soleil au visage et le bleu des océans
Je veux des chameaux des mirages
Et des déserts envoûtants
Des caravanes et des voyages comme sur les dépliants

Va pour tes cocotiers, tes rivages
Va pour tes lagons tout bleus balançant
J'habite où l'amour est un village là où l'on m'attend

J'irai où tu iras, mon pays sera toi
J'irai où tu iras, qu'importe la place
Qu'importe l'endroit
Prends tes clics et tes clacs et tes rêves et ta vie
Tes mots, tes tabernacles et ta langue d'ici
L'escampette et la poudre et la fille de l'air
Montre-moi tes édens, montre-moi tes enfers
Tes Nords et puis tes Suds et tes zestes d'Ouest
Prends tes clics et tes clacs et tes rêves et ta vie
Tes mots, tes tabernacles et ta langue d'ici
L'escampette et la poudre et la fille de l'air
Montre-moi tes édens, montre-moi tes enfers

Chez moi les forts se balancent
Et les toits grattent le ciel
Les eaux des torrents sont violence
Et les neiges sont éternelles
Chez moi les loups sont à nos portes
Et tous les enfants les comprennent
On entend les cris de New York
Et les bateaux sur la Seine

Qu'importe j'irai où bon te semble
J'aime tes envies, j'aime ta lumière
Tous les paysages te ressemblent
Quand tu les éclaires

J'irai où tu iras, mon pays sera toi
J'irai où tu iras, qu'importe la place

When you run so deep in me

Gonna stand by your side now
Let me kiss all your tears away
You can stay in my arms now
And I know I can make you believe me again

I walk, but you can run through fire
I search for reasons, and baby, you inspire
But I know somebody hurt you
And I know you really need a friend
Well you can take my hand

Gonna stand by your side now
Let me kiss all your tears away
You can stay in my arms now
And I know I can make you believe me again

When you're feeling like you can't go on
Don't you know you never walk alone? No

Gonna stand by your side now
Let me kiss all your tears away
You can stay in my arms now
And I know I can make you believe again

Live and die
Life is a dream we are dreaming
Day by day
I find my way
Look for the soul and the meaning

Then you look at me
And I always see
What I have been searching for
I'm lost as can be
Then you look at me
And I am not lost anymore

People run
Sun to sun
Caught in their lives ever flowing
Once begun
Life goes until it's gone
We have to go where it's going

Then you look at me
And I always see
What I have been searching for
I'm lost as can be
Then you look at me
And I am not lost anymore

And you say you see
When you look at me
The reason you love life so
Though lost I have been
I find love again
And life just keeps on running
And life just keeps on running
You look at me and life comes
From you

Touches the current of love
So deep in me
Every sigh in the night
Every tear that you cry

And all that I am
And all that I'll be
Means nothing at all
If you can't be with me
Your most innocent kiss
Or your sweetest caress

I don't care about tomorrow
I've given up on yesterday
Here and now is all that matters
Right here with you is where I'll stay
Everything in this world
Every voice in the night
Every little thing of beauty
Comes shining through in your eyes
And all that is you becomes part of me too
'Cause all you do seduces me

And if I should die tomorrow
I'd go down with a smile on my face
I thank God I've ever known you
I'd fall down on my knees
For all the love we have made


Every sigh in the night
Every tear that you cry
Seduces me, oh seduces me
And all that you do... Seduces me

3 ContributorsIt’s All Coming Back to Me Now (Radio Version) Lyrics
There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
Now

(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when I touch you like that
(It's all coming back to me now)
If you do it like this

And in my heart there is no doubt
That this is going to be
The brightest holiday
Because here you are with me

Makes me feel the special way that you do

Ooh, you make the season bright
With the lights reflecting in your eyes
All my dreams are coming true tonight
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love

We'll stay up late tonight
Decorate the tree
Just look into my eyes
And I will tell you truthfully
That I don't need no Santa Claus
To hear my Christmas wish
I got you in my arms
And what could be a better gift
Than to spend my very favorite time of year
With the one I really love so near, Oh Yeah

Does it always have to move at its own kinda pace?
When you're drivin' on cruise control, coming off a bumpy ride
And your heart is back in shape
Then it hits you with no chance to hide

But don't you miss out on the way
Don't find a reason to say

Coulda woulda shoulda
But I didn't do that
You gotta give it a shot, better believe
And don't say you
Coulda woulda shoulda (Coulda woulda shoulda)
But I didn't do that
Just throw in everything you've got
'Cause in love, there's no holding back

Tell me that you played it safe
'Cause you're afraid to hurt your neck
On the roller coaster train
Never knowing what you get
Do you wanna be cynical?
Want a date with destiny
Giving up the greatest trash
Who knows what it turns out to be

Don't you miss out on the way (Out on the way)
Don't find a reason to say

Coulda woulda shoulda (Coulda woulda shoulda)
But I didn't do that
You gotta give it a shot
Better believe
And don't say you

But I didn't do that
Just throw in everything you've got
'Cause in love, there's no holding back
Ooh-ooh-ooh

It's meant to be
But don't think about it
Let love run free
'Cause you're on your way
Follow your heart when it's calling on you
Don't you say
Oh, oh
But I didn't do that, I didn't do that, baby
Oh
Gotta believe it

I let fear control me

I let go
Didn't know
Where the answer would be

Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking but
Somehow, someway, we couldn't see
That the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me

Mmm
Faith, it can lift you up
And we've you got enough
To reach a new beginning
Love can withstand a storm
In the final hour
We'll find the joy in living

Don't let go
'Cause I know
Pretty soon you will see
Yeah!

Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking but
Somehow, someway, we couldn't see
That the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me

You are my tomorrow
There's safety in your arms
Where you'll go I'll follow
'Cause you're the world where I belong

Right in front of you
In front of me
Somehow we couldn't see
Right in front of you
I had to fall to finally see
Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking but
Somehow, someway, we couldn't see
That the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see

Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking but
Somehow, someway, we couldn't see
That the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me

I finally see, yeah

[Song 108: In His Touch]
7 ContributorsIn His Touch Lyrics
Forgive me
Don't know where to start
I guess we've come to
The serious part
I need to find out
If there's a chance for us

Don't give me that same old look
It won't win me over
Don't give me that same old speech
You don't have to speak at all

You can say you love me
That I'm your perfect crush
How it hurts to need someone that much
You can swear you mean it
But that ain't good enough
'Cause when a man loves a woman, it is all
In his touch
{Verse 2}
I wish you could see, yeah
Just how simple
It's supposed to be

'Cause now that we've come this far
We don't want to lose it
If you wanna win my heart
Baby, just shut your mouth

You can say you love me
That I'm your perfect crush
How it hurts to need someone that much
You can swear you mean it
But that ain't good enough
'Cause when a man loves a woman, it is all
In his touch

Then words don't mean that much

You can say you love me
That I'm your perfect crush
How it hurts to need someone that much
You can swear you mean it
But that ain't good enough
'Cause when a man loves a woman, it is all
In his touch

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy

Close your eyes
Have no fear
The monster's gone
He's on the run
And your mummy's here

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy

Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way
It's getting better and better

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy

Out on the ocean, sailing away
I can hardly wait
To see you come of age
But I guess we'll both just have to be patient
Cause it's a long way to go
A hard row to hoe
Yes it's a long way to go
But in the meantime
Before you cross the street
Take my hand
Life is just what happens to you while you're busy making other plans

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy

7 ContributorsRain, Tax (It’s Inevitable) Lyrics
It's inevitable
Mm-mm, hmm

I did not know there was a plan
Somewhere a perfect man
I don't believe in the stars
And then you smiled at my pretense
As you broke down my defenses
Just wanna be where you are
Love ain't like fashion
The look remains the same
I'll wear your heart forever
'Cause some things never change

Like rain, tax
After lightning the thunder cracks (It's inevitable)
Sooner or later, it had to come true
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks (It's inevitable)
You see what I want
What I want is you

I thought that life was logical
Love was a miracle
That happened to someone else, not me
Baby, I must've said a little prayer
Suddenly I looked up and you were there
And the rest is history
I don't wanna be an island anymore
Just resign yourself
'Cause there's one thing for sure

Like rain, tax
After lightning the thunder cracks (It's inevitable)
Sooner or later, it had to come true (It's inevitable)
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks (It's inevitable)
You see what I want
What I want is you
Yeah

It had to be you
It had to be you
Say you'll be here forever
You and me here together
(When will you see what I want)
What I want is you

Like rain, tax
After lightning the thunder cracks (It's inevitable)
Sooner or later, it had to come true
Like rain (Rain), tax (Tax)
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks (It's inevitable)
You see what I want
What I want is you  (It's inevitable)
Like rain (Rain), tax
After lightning the thunder cracks (It's inevitable)
(You could see what I want)
Sooner or later, it had to come true (It's inevitable)
Like rain, tax (Ooh)
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks (It's inevitable)
You could see what I want
What I want is you
Like rain (Rain), tax

6 ContributorsL’amour existe encore Lyrics
Quand je m'endors contre ton corps
Alors je n'ai plus de doute
L'amour existe encore

Toutes mes années de déroute
Toutes, je les donnerais toutes
Pour m'ancrer à ton port

La solitude que je redoute
Qui me guette au bout de ma route
Je la mettrai dehors

Pour t'aimer une fois pour toutes
Pour t'aimer coûte que coûte
Malgré ce mal qui court
Et met l'amour à mort

Quand je m'endors contre ton corps
Alors je n'ai plus de doute
L'amour existe encore

L'amour existe encore...

On n'était pas du même bord
Mais au bout du compte on s'en fout
D'avoir raison ou tort

Le monde est mené par des fous
Mon amour il n'en tient qu'à nous
De nous aimer plus fort

Au-delà de la violence
Au-delà de la démence
Malgré les bombes qui tombent
Aux quatre coins du monde

Quand je m'endors contre ton corps
Alors je n'ai plus de doute
L'amour existe encore
L'amour existe encore
L'amour existe encore...

Pour t'aimer une fois pour toutes
Pour t'aimer coûte que coûte
Malgré ce mal qui court
Et met l'amour à mort

Quand je m'endors contre ton corps
Alors je n'ai plus de doute
L'amour existe encore

Infinity, where does it start?
Where do we go when we depart?
The ice is thin; you're standing still
When you advance, it falls apart

Open your eyes, look straight ahead
A morning sky hangs by a thread
You hear your voice as it echoes
The heart of a man as he grows will glow

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Sing a hymn


Sing a hymn for your brothers
Everybody needs to know
Sing a hymn for your father
And finally, the sun will glow

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Sing a hymn
For your father

10 ContributorsI Don’t Know Lyrics
A mountain of stone, a door of steel
Can't stand in my way, I'd go on
Brutal machines, unbending laws
Can't slow me down, I'd go on
I've learned how to deal and when to fight
I know what's real, I know what's right
I'm not afraid, a wounded dove
I can be tender in a world so tough

I'm sure I could face the bitter cold
But life without you, I don't know

The winds of the heart can blow me down (Blow me down)
But I get right up
And I stand my ground
I've tasted fear, my share of pain
The wasted tears of love in vain
I've held you tight, pushed you away
Now with all my might I beg you to stay

I'm sure I could face the bitter cold
But life without you, I don't know

I know what I want, I know what I need
(I know just what I need)
But there's just one thing I must believe (I must believe)
Deep in the night by a dying flame
You will be there when I call your name (Call your name)

I'm sure I could face the bitter cold
But life without you, I don't know (I don't know)

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

Y conocí la soledad
Jugué al amor sin entregar
Sin esperar
Salgo a buscar
Alguna huella, una señal
Hacer mi sueño realidad

Quiero saber
Como es que siente una mujer
Mi corazón no aguanta más
La soledad

Sola otra vez
No sé vivir
Sola otra vez
Sin amor

Sola otra vez
Estoy aquí

Quise volar
Y conocí la soledad
Jugué al amor sin entregar

Ya no quiero estar tan sola otra vez sin amor

[Song 115: Miles to Go (Before I Sleep)]
10 ContributorsMiles to Go (Before I Sleep) Lyrics
I would walk to the edge of the universe for you
Paint you a crimson sunset over sheltering skies
I could learn all the world dialects for you
Whisper sonnets in your ear discovering truth
I could never worship pagan gods around me
I will only follow the path that leads me to you baby, always

Every step I take for you
I will always defend, never pretend
That every breath I take for love
I could never be wrong, the journey is long
With miles to go before I sleep, miles to go before I sleep

I would carry the rock of Gibraltar just for you
Lifted like a pebble from the beach to the skies
I could build you a bridge that spans the ocean wide
But the greatest gift I'd give you would be to stand by your side
Some can criticize and sit in judgment of us, babe
But they can't take away the love that lives inside us always

Every step I take for you
I will always defend, never pretend
That every breath I take for love
I could never be wrong, the journey is long
With miles to go before I sleep, miles to go before I sleep

I won't run from the changing signs along the highway
Let the rivers flow to the highest ground created

Every step I take for you
I will always defend, never pretend
That every breath I take for love
I could never be wrong, the journey is long
With miles to go before I sleep, miles to go before I sleep

5 ContributorsLet Your Heart Decide Lyrics
I understand that you've met someone
With a perfect heart
But you've been questioned by everyone
So you're in the dark
Can you choose to fall
Should you risk it all

How'm I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I'm on your side
And I understand you're the only one to know
Whether wrong or right
Let your heart decide (you're the only one)

Some may tell you don't take the risk
It's a waste of time
But if you think you'll find happiness
Baby take the dive
It's unusual
But it's critical

How'm I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I'm on your side
And I understand you're the only one to know
Whether wrong or right
Let your heart decide (you're the only one)
Give it up, oh
How'm I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I'm on your side
And I understand you're the only one to know
Whether wrong or right

In a room that still reminds me
My heart has got to learn to forget
Starting on my own
With every breath I'm getting stronger
This is not the time for regret
Cause I don't need to hang on to heartbreak, oh babe
When there's so much of life left to live

Love is on the way
On wings of angels
I know it's true, I feel it coming through
Love is on the way
Time is turning the pages
I don't know when
But love will find me again

I am not afraid
Of the mystery of tomorrow
I have found the faith deep within
There's a promise I have made
There's a dream I'm gonna follow
There's another chance to begin
And it's coming as sure as the heavens, oh yeah
I can feel it right here in my heart

Love is on the way
On wings of angels
I know it's true, I feel it coming through
Love is on the way
Time is turning the pages

On wings of angels
I know it's true, I feel it coming through

Time is turning the pages
I don't know when
But love will find me again

I don't know when

10 ContributorsUs Lyrics
I want to know why
You're letting this die
Without the blink of an eye
You say that you need time
I say you'll be fine

If you could only see
Like you did before
You became imprisoned
Can I reopen the door

You say it doesn't matter
Then tell me what does
And why that isn't what
You've been thinking of
You say it's never easy
Then tell me what was
Is it never worth the pain
Could you believe it was
When life keeps living
That's what life keeps giving
To us

Once we were one mind
Drifting in one time
And ever true
We were friends
But something is gone from my
Picture of this life

If we would only see
Like we did before
We became imprisoned
Can I reopen the door

You say it doesn't matter
Then tell me what does
And why that isn't what
You've been thinking of
You say it's never easy
Then tell me what was
Is it never worth the pain
Could you believe it was
When life keeps living
That's what life keeps giving
To us

The hope has vanished from your eyes
You were my faith and one truth
There's every reason to get through
Oh, and you're why I know there's a reason

If we could only see
Like we did before
We became imprisoned
Can I reopen the door

You say it doesn't matter
Then tell me what does
And why that isn't what
What you've been thinking of
You say it's never easy
Then tell me what was
Is it never worth the pain
Could you believe it was
You say it doesn't matter
Then tell me what does
And why that isn't what
What you've been thinking of
You say it's never easy, oh
Then tell me what was
Is it never worth the pain
Could you believe it was
When life keeps living
That's when life keeps giving
To us
To us
To us

Keep on living

I listen to the sound of the rain fallin' down my window
Prayin' for a gentle wind
To bring my baby back again
Tryin' to be strong but I'm not getting any stronger
Loneliness is tearin' apart this heart of mine

I lie awake
'Cause I can't take
Another night lonely
It's been too long
I can't hold on no more

Leavin' on the next plane out
'Cause I gotta see my baby
It's been too long
Since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
'Til he's sleeping here beside me
Here beside me again

Talking on the phone but that don't make it any better
Nothing's gonna ease this pain
Until I'm in his arms again
Runnin' down the stairs there's a taxi that's waiting for me
Loneliness, I'm gonna leave you far behind
I'd walk for days
Through pouring rain
Anything to be with him
It's been too long
I can't be strong no more

Leavin' on the next plane out
'Cause I gotta see my baby
It's been too long
Since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
No, no, no, no
'Til he's sleeping here beside me
Here beside me again
I gotta be with my baby

Gotta be with him
Gotta be by his side, yeah
I'm gonna be with him
My heart's made up my mind

I'm leavin' on the next plane out
'Cause I gotta see my baby
It's been too long
Since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
No, no, no, no
'Til he's sleeping here beside me, yeah
Here beside me again, again, again, again, again, again

It's been too long
Since I held him in my arms
And I just won't sleep at night
No, no, no, no
'Til he's sleeping here beside me
Here beside me again
I gotta be with my baby
Gonna be with my baby
I'm gonna take the next plane
Or the next train
Gotta get there
Gotta see my baby
And nothing's gonna stop me
From leavin' this town
Leavin' on the next plane out
Leavin' on the next plane out

If ever a boy stood on the moon
All the heavens would call them angels 'round
Stop the tears from troubled skies
From falling
If ever the river could whisper your name
Would the choices you made still be the same?
Like a flower that dies from angry rain
Why do we hurt ourselves?

Where is the love that lets the sunlight in to start again?
A love that sees no color lines
Life begins with love
So spread your wings and fly
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered
A thousand dreams that we can still believe

If ever a boy stood on the moon
Carrying all of his treasures from the stars
To a rainbow which leads to where we are
Together we'd chase the sun

Where is the love that lifts my brother's voice to the skies?
A love that answers a mother's cry
Life begins with love
So spread your wings and fly
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered
A thousand dreams that we can still believe

A boy stood on the moon
The ancient souls can still discover
A thousand dreams that we can still believe
That we can still believe
We can still believe
We can still believe

I'm looking back through the years
Down this highway
Memories; they all lead up to this one day
And many dreams lost along the way
Haunt me still
I guess they always will
When love was too much to bear
I just left it there
Here I stand, face to face
With this heart of mine
Livin' without you I only fall behind
We had a love most people never find
All this time
I never realized
And the courage I finally found
Has made me turn around

There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime
One heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back
I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me

I can still hear the song of your laughter
I can still taste the sorrow of your tears
We said "Goodbye", but our hearts did not hear
Now, my love, there's nothing left to fear
With all my heart put me through
It leads me back to you

There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime
One heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back
I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me
There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime
One heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back
I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me
'Cause I'm gonna run back
I'm gonna run back
'Cause, baby, I need you right here

Je lui dirai qu'il est de ce pays
Où son grand-père était bûcheron
Que dans son sang l'Orient coule aussi
Que les mélanges font de beaux enfants
Qu'il est fort et bien vivant

Je lui dirai qu'il est né de l'amour
Que nous l'attendions passionnément
Que chaque nuit s'efface au nouveau jour
Qu'il sera grand mais qu'il a bien le temps
Oh dieu qu'il a bien le temps

Et que la vie l'appelle, que le monde l'attend
Que la terre est si belle et le ciel est si grand
Qu'il est beau, que je l'aime, qu'il est ma vie, ma joie
Qu'il est un parmi des millions d'humains
Mais bien l'unique pour moi

Je lui dirai qu'ici bas tout s'apprend
Le bien le mal et même le bonheur
Qu'il ne perde jamais ses yeux d'enfant
Devant trop de malheurs et de laideur
Qu'il regarde avec son coeur

Je lui dirai d'être sage et prudent
D'aller frôler les glaces et les feux
Qu'il goûte à tout mais sans jamais dépendre
Que trop peut être pire que trop peu
Oh bien pire que trop peu

Et que la vie l'appelle que le monde l'attend
Que la terre est si belle et le ciel est si grand
Qu'il est beau, que je l'aime, qu'il est ma vie, ma joie
Qu'il est un parmi des millions d'humains
Mais bien l'unique pour moi

Je lui dirai les chansons, les poèmes
Qu'il n'y a pas d'amour sans histoire
Que le bonheur est un grain que l'on sème
Qu'amour et santé ne s'achètent pas
Et qu'on n'est riche que de ça

Je lui dirai qu'un jour une autre femme
Viendra l'aimer et qu'il l'aimera
Que j'en mourrai de bonheur et de larmes
Mais que nous serons là, pas après pas
Que c'est la vie et sa loi

Et que la vie l'appelle, que le monde l'attend
Que la terre est si belle et le ciel est si grand
Qu'il est beau, que je l'aime, qu'il est ma vie, ma joie
Qu'il est un parmi des millions d'humains

Giving just a little kiss
To the ones you love
Don't even wait a little while
To give them just a little smile
A little is enough
How many people are crying
People are dying
How many people are asking for love

So don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find your way
'Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on
Love

How could you wait another minute
A hug is warmer when you're in it
And Baby that's a fact
And saying "I love you's" always better
Seasons, reasons, they don't matter
So don't hold back
How many people in this world
So needful in this world
How many people are praying for love

So don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find your way
'Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on
Love

Let all the children know
Everywhere that they go
Their whole life long
Let them know love

Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way (Find your way)
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, hey, hey)
Find your way (Hey, hey, hey)
Everyone, everywhere (Don't save it all)
For Christmas Day
Find your way
'Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on
Love

[Song 127: Regarde-moi]
4 ContributorsRegarde-moi Lyrics
C'est comme une machine, à fond de train
Une locomotive qui foncerait sans fin
Des coups des secousses, je m'habitue pas
Qui conduit, qui pousse ce train, qui sait où il va
J'ai mal à la tête, j'ai mal au cœur
Faites que l'on arrête, appelez-moi le contrôleur
Je veux qu'on m'explique, je veux quelqu'un
En cas de panique c'est écrit là
Oh, tirez sur le frein à main

Et toi qu'est-ce que tu fous là
Sur ton sofa, à côté d'moi
Tu vois pas que j'crève, que j'suis vidée
Que j'ai plus de sève, que je vais lâcher
Regarde-moi, dis-moi les mots tendres
Ces mots tout bas
Fais-moi redescendre loin de tout loin de tout ça
Je veux, je commande, regarde-moi
J'ai besoin de tes yeux
C'est le miroir où j'existe, sans eux
Je ne me vois pas

Mais tout nous aspire, petits écrans
Faut montrer le pire ailleurs
Pour accepter nos néants
Si t'y prends pas garde, avec le temps
Tu te fous des gares et jamais plus tu ne redescends
Les tempes qui cognent, ça me reprend
Ou tu te raisonnes ou tu prends des médicaments
Mais je voudrais savoir, une fois seulement
La fin de l'histoire et pourquoi, où et comment
Qui sont les bons et les méchants

Et toi qu'est-ce que tu fous là
Sur ton sofa, à côté de moi
Tu vois pas que j'crève, que je suis vidée
Que j'ai plus de sève, rien à donner
Regarde-moi, dis-moi les mots tendres
Ces mots tout bas
Fais-moi redescendre loin de tout loin de tout ça
Je veux, je commande, regarde-moi
J'ai besoin de tes yeux
C'est le miroir où j'existe, sans eux
Je ne me vois pas

Regarde-moi, regarde-moi
J'ai besoin de tes yeux
C'est le miroir où j'existe, sans eux
Je ne me vois pas
Fais-moi redescendre loin de tout loin de tout ça
Regarde-moi, regarde-moi

[Song 128: With This Tear]
15 ContributorsWith This Tear Lyrics
With this tear, I thee want
I long for you you to talk to me like you did
That night in the restaurant
You spoke of love so openly
And again and again you promised me
That you'd never leave
But now you're gone

With this voice, I thee call
Sometimes I catch myself calling your name
When you're not there at all
Please tell me what I did wrong
Why must I hear your voice inside my head
All day and all night long?
It's not fair


With these arms I held you
When you told me you were dying, I had less courage
It's true
And you wrote every day
Writing 'bout the things that we could do
When your pain went away
But all that went away was you

With this tear, I thee want
I long for you to talk to me like you did
That night in the restaurant
With this tear, I thee want

I thee want
I thee want
I thee want

With this tear, I thee want
I long for you you to talk to me like you did
That night in the restaurant
You spoke of love so openly
And again and again you promised me
That you'd never leave
But now you're gone

With this tear

[Song 129: You Make Me Feel (Like a Natural Woman)]
9 ContributorsYou Make Me Feel (Like a Natural Woman) Lyrics
Lookin' out on the mornin' rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Oh, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

When my soul was in the lost-and-found
You came along to claim it
And didn't know just what was wrong with me
Oh, 'til your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm livin' for
'Cause if I make you happy
I don't need to do more

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

Oh, baby, what you've done to me
You make me feel so good inside
Good inside
And I, I just wanna be close to you
Because you make me feel so alive
Oh, what you've done to me
Close to you because you make me feel so alive
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman
{Outro}
Woman
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman
You make me feel
Oh, baby, what you do to me
Can make me feel so good inside
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
Oh, what you've done
Natural woman

I've been over you for some time now, baby
I don't miss your kiss like before now anymore now
If you asked me how I'm doin', I'm fine
All I needed was a little time

So if you think that I still need you, baby
I really don't know why

Oh, baby, since you left me
You might think that my world's been torn apart
But if you see me, baby, you'll see
That nothing's broken, nothing broken but my heart

You won't find no tears in my eyes now baby
If you think I'm sad that you're gone now
Then you're wrong now
If you ask I'll say I'm happy I'm free
Tell you that's the way I wanna be
And all those nights we shared together baby
We'll they don't mean a thing

Oh, baby, since you left me
You might think that my world's been torn apart
But if you see me, baby, you'll see that
Nothing's broken, nothing broken but my heart

So if you think that I need you, baby
I don't think about you
I'm happy now without you

Oh, baby, since left me
You might think my world's been torn apart
Oh, but you'll see that
Nothing's broken, nothing broken but my heart
Oh, baby, since you left me
You might think that my world's been torn apart
But if you see me, baby, you'll see that
Nothing's broken, nothing broken but my heart
Nothing broken, nothing broken but my heart
Baby, you might thing my world's been torn apart
But nothing's broken, nothing broken but my heart

12 ContributorsWater from the Moon Lyrics
I've looked everywhere I can
Just to find a clue
Oh to get to you
And make you want me
And I've run circles around the sun
Chasin' after you
Oh but it's no use
Can't you see that I'm going out of my mind
Trying to find a way to get through to you
Oh you don't know how hard I try
And I try and I try
What do I gotta do?

Do I gotta get water from the moon?
Is that what I gotta do
To make you love me?
Do I gotta turn the sand into the sea?
Is that what you want from me?
I've done everything that I can do
But get water from the moon

I've reached high up in the sky
Tryin' to steal the stars
Oh to win your heart
But even that's not enough
And I've searched every book I know
Just to find the words
Oh to touch your world and get some love out of you
I've already given all I can give
And I don't know what's left to try
And I try and I try
What do I gotta do?

Do I gotta get water from the moon?
Is that what I gotta do
To make you love me?
Do I gotta turn the sand into the sea?
Is that what you want from me?
I've done everything that I can do
But get water from the moon

Love me, how do I make you love me?
How do I make you see that I'm going out of my mind?
I try, and I try, and I try

Do I gotta get water from the moon?
What do I gotta do
To make you love me?
Do I gotta turn the sand into the sea?
Is that what you want from me?
I've done everything that I can do
But get water, water from the moon
Baby
Love me baby

I've done everything
You've got to love me, baby
I've done everything

Yeah
No more sadness

I wanna be the one to make you happy
I wanna be the one to give you hope
But in these days of conscious living
We've got to take it slow
You can't be sure of who you've met
You just don't know what you might get
Cause in these crazy times we're living
Love can turn into regret

But you, could be the one to change my point of view
It's all up to you

Give you love without the pain
Show you light beyond the rain
Gonna make you happy
Gonna make you happy now
There'll be days when things go wrong
I'll be there to make you strong

I wanna find a place where dreams can happen
I wanna find a love who'll take me there
And in your eyes I see a vision
That makes me want to care
And if two people both agree
That only love can set them free
Then together let us make a world
Of which others only dream

And you can be the one to make it all come true
So what you gonna do

I thought I knew you, thought that I knew you well
We had a rhythm, but I guess you never can tell
Oh, I learned early never to ignore the signs
You'll be forgiven
It ain't worth that much to my mind
Loving you (Was) so easy, it's hard to say goodbye
But if it's the way it goes it goes

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled

Loving somebody ain't your average nine to five
It takes conviction; it takes a will to survive
I'm not somebody who commits the crime
And leaves the scene
But when I've been dissed
I don't spend much time on what might've been
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
Now I'm movin', movin' on

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled

Get on with my life
And you're not on my mind
Am I too close to time to get over you?
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
So I'm moving on (And on, and on, and on, and on)

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries (Just another page)
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You're seriously misled
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think it, think it, think it, think it, baby
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled

6 ContributorsI Knew I Loved You LyricsI knew I loved you
Before I knew you
The hands of time
Would lead me to you
An evening star
Was from afar
It guided me here
It knew you'd be here
Now wrapped in moonlight
At last together
Here in the incandescent glow
We are all we need to know
As we softly please each other
'Til the stars and shadow glow
And we sleep
With our dreams around us
Oooohhhh ahhh
Ooohhhh oh yeahhh
It guided me
It knew you'd be here
I knew I loved you
Before I found you
I knew I'd built my world around you
Now all my days
And all my nights
And my tomorrows
Will all begin
And end
With you...
With you...

[Song 135: Destin]
4 ContributorsDestin Lyrics
Y'a pas de voiles aux volets de mes frères
Y'a pas d'opale autour de mes doigts
Ni cathédrale où cacher mes prières
Juste un peu d'or autour de ma voix
Je vais les routes et je vais les frontières
Je sens, j'écoute, et j'apprends, je vois
Le temps s'égoutte au long des fuseaux horaires
Je prends, je donne, avais-je le choix ?

Tel est mon destin
Je vais mon chemin
Ainsi passent mes heures
Au rythme entêtant des battements de mon cœur

Des feux d'été je vole aux sombres hivers
Des pluies d'automne aux étés indiens
Terres gelées aux plus arides déserts
Je vais je viens, ce monde est le mien
Je vis de notes et je vis de lumière
Je virevolte à vos cris, vos mains
La vie m'emporte au creux de tous ses mystères
Je vois dans vos yeux mes lendemains


Tel est mon destin
Je vais mon chemin
Ainsi passent mes heures
Au rythme entêtant des battements de mon cœur

Je vais les routes et je vais les frontières
Je sens, j'écoute, et j'apprends, je vois
Le temps s'égoutte au long des fuseaux horaires
Je prends, je donne, avais-je le choix ?
Je prends le blues aux signaux des répondeurs
Je prends la peine aux aéroports
Je vis l'amour à des kilomètres ailleurs
Et le bonheur à mon téléphone

Tel est mon destin
Je vais mon chemin
Ainsi passent mes heures
Au rythme entêtant des battements de mon cœur

Dans mes absences, parfois, sans doute
J'aurais pu m'éloigner
Comme si j'avais perdu ma route
Comme si j'avais changé
Alors j'ai quelques mots tendresse
Juste pour le dire

Je ne vous oublie pas, non, jamais
Vous êtes au creux de moi
Dans ma vie, dans tout ce que je fais
Mes premiers amours
Mes premiers rêves sont venus avec vous
C'est notre histoire à nous

Je ne vous oublie pas, non, jamais
Vous savez tant de moi
De ma vie, de tout ce que j'en fais
Alors mes bonheurs
Mes déchirures avec vous
C'est notre histoire à nous
Je ne vous oublie pas

Parce que le temps peut mettre en cage
Nos rêves et nos envies
Je fais mes choix et mes voyages
Parfois j'en paie Le prix
La vie me sourie ou me blesse
Quelle que soit ma vie

Je ne vous oublie pas

Même  l'autre bout de la terre
Je continue mon histoire avec vous

How they feel or what they say
You're everything, I never knew
I always wanted, baby
I've been warned so many times
They tell me I've ignored the signs
But nobody knows you like I do
The only one for me is you

I can't stop, can't fight, can't resist it

You're dangerous, but they won't stop
Until I leave, you won't believe
That being with you won't break my heart
So worried about the road ahead
They can't see that, your my best friend
They're never gonna take me away from you
There's nothing they can do

I can't stop, I can't fight, I can't resist it (Can't fight)

When the feeling's so strong?
I know you're where I belong
They say I let my heart
Make up my mind
That's why I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye

Mmmmm...

So many 25th's of December
Just as many 4th of July's
And we're still holding it together
It only comes down to you and I
I know that you can still remember
Things we said right from the start
When we said that this could be special
I'm keepin' those words deep down in my heart

Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by

I never been much for occasions
But you never let a birthday go by
Mmm, without announcing how much you love me
But the truth was always there
Right there in your eyes
And we're still holding hands when we're walkin'
Acting like we've only just met
But how could that be
When there's so much history
I guess that's how true lovers can get

Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by

Oh-oo Ma-oo--hoo-hoo

Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by

I don’t want another piece of your mind
So take it somewhere else for the night
Because I can’t take another goodbye
If you wanna fight, bite your tongue
Before you explode
But don’t let this get out of control
You don’t want me to leave you alone

When somebody loves somebody
That’s the way it’s supposed to be
Cause you know nobody else would put up with your games, oh
I don’t believe you, lover
You don't wanna go, no
That’s not the way it is when somebody loves somebody

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
When somebody loves somebody

Wait, I’m hearing every word that you say
You wonder if we made a mistake
It’s written all over your face
You know it’s too late
We’ve already fallen in love
Tell me, is it asking too much
For you to stick it out when it’s tough?
Is it ever enough?

When somebody loves somebody
That’s the way it’s supposed to be
Cause you know nobody else would put up with your games, oh
I don’t believe you, lover
You don't wanna go, no
That’s not the way it is when somebody loves somebody

Eh, eh, eh, eh
When somebody loves somebody

Some people live their lives
Never believing in love
I don’t want that for us

When somebody loves somebody
That’s the way it’s supposed to be
Cause you know nobody else would put up with your games, oh
I don’t believe you, lover
You don't wanna go, no
That’s not the way it is when somebody loves somebody
When somebody loves somebody
That’s the way it’s supposed to be
Cause you know nobody else would put up with your games, oh
I don’t believe you, lover
You don't wanna go, no
That’s not the way it is when somebody loves somebody

El calor de tu mirada me hizo despertar
De ese largo sueño, de esa soledad
Caminar junto a tu lado era natural
Contigo me escapé del mundo a otra dimensión
En tus brazos yo sentía que perdía la razón
El miedo de entregarme con tu piel se me borró
Y en mi corazón, por ti
Se despertaba el amor
Como despierta una flor
Cuando el viento la acaricia
Y se entrega ante el calor
Se despertaba el amor
Con esta loca pasión
Junto a ti descubro lo que es
Amar haciendo el amor
Fuimos descubriendo secretos de los dos
Y así entre risa y lágrimas el sol nos encontró
Somos dos extraños que el cielo confesó
Amantes que el destino sedujo sin control
Contigo me escapé del mundo a otra dimensión
En tus brazos yo sentía que perdía la razón
El miedo de entregarme con tu piel se me borró
Y en mi corazón, por ti

Se despertaba el amor
Como despierta una flor
Cuando el viento la acaricia
Y se entrega ante el calor
Se despertaba el amor
Con esta loca pasión
Junto a ti descubro lo que es
Amar haciendo el amor
Como un dia soñé
Cuando el sentimiento es tan profundo
Entre el hombre y la mujer
Cuando es de verdad cuando sientes más
Y el deseo llega más adentro
Oooo...
Contigo me escapé del mundo a otra dimensión
En tus brazos yo sentía que perdía la razón
El miedo de entregarme con tu piel se me borró
Y en mi corazón, y en mi corazón...
Se despertaba el amor
Como despierta una flor
Cuando el viento la acaricia
Y se entrega ante el calor

Se despertaba el amor
Con esta loca pasión
Junto a ti descubro lo que es
Amar haciendo el amor...

Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go

Why when I looked in your eyes

Ooh why
Why did you have to lie
Cause I felt the trust start to die
Why o why

It's so hard to say goodbye

How can you tell me it was nothing
Cause you took away everything I dreamed in
Just a night and I held you so tight
When you know you were sleeping in my bed

I tried to swallow my pride
But I felt my heart start to tremble inside
Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go
Tell me

Ooh why
Why did you have to lie
Cause I felt the trust start to die
Why oh why

It's so hard to say goodbye

Should I quietly leave through the door
Or maybe pretend the way things were once
Before when I met you I'll never forget you
So

Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt trust start to die
My oh my
When I saw you with the other girl

Ooh why
Why did you have to lie
Cause I felt the trust start to die
Why o why
When I still love you
It's so hard to say goodbye

You can stay prepared that I won't be letting you go
In the heat of the night

So right you taste my sweetness on your lips
I'll make it better than you ever dreamed
And the rest of your life will be just like this

(Baby) So listen up, it's you I trust
I feel magic every time that we touch
(Baby) I pledge allegiance to the heavens above
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love
So listen up, it's you I trust
I feel magic every time that we touch
(Yeah) I pledge allegiance to the heavens above
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love

Declaration of love (Love)
Declaration of love (Heh)
Declaration of love (Oh)
Declaration of love (No no no no)
Declaration of love (To you baby)
Declaration of love (Oh)

In the heat of the night
So right you taste my sweetness on your lips
I'll make it better than you ever dreamed
And the rest of your life will be just like this

(Baby) So listen up, it's you I trust
I feel magic every time that we touch baby, baby
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love

So listen up, it's you I trust
I feel magic every time that we touch
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love
So listen up, it's you I trust
Don't you know, don't you know
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above
I swear to you baby
So listen up, it's you I trust
I feel magic every time that we touch
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love
So listen up, it's you I trust
Don't you know, don't you know
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above
I swear to you baby

So listen up, it's you I trust
(Ooh) I pledge allegiance to the heavens above

[Song 144: Breakaway]
13 ContributorsBreakaway Lyrics
From the fire in your words
To the dagger in your eye
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
I pretend to be asleep
But I know you hear me cry
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down

But if I really want to change
Then I must admit
That I'm the one to blame

If I could break away
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted
I could break away

Is it true what people say
That it's darkest before dawn?
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
Any hope we might have saved
Is too weak to let live on
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
And if I really want a change
Then tonight I'm going to need
All of my strength

If I could break away
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted
I could break away

Oh, anything is better than this
I know
Anything is better

If I could break away
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted

If I could break away
If I could turn the page
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty hearted
I could break away

[Song 145: Love of My Life]
4 ContributorsLove of My Life Lyrics
I know it's been a little while
But I still think of you all the time
I memorized your stupid smile
And I can feel it kissing mine, oh

From the first moment
And I would hold it down
From the first moment
From the first moment

You, you are the love of my
You are the love of my life
You, you are the love of my
Always the love of my life
The good, the bad, the ugly too
I take it all because the truth is
You, you are the love of my
You are the love of my life
My life

Whеn it comes to you and me
I'll nevеr say the word "goodbye," mm
Because we are eternity
Your essence is my lullaby

From the first moment
And I would hold it down
From the first moment
From the first moment

You, you are the love of my
You are the love of my life
You, you are the love of my
Always the love of my life
The good, the bad, the ugly too
I take it all because the truth is
You, you are the love of my
You are the love of my life

We were never close to perfect
Baby, perfect's not the world I wanna live, no
We were never close to perfect
We were never close, but no one is, so

You, you are the love of my
Always the love of my life
You, you are the love of my
Always the love of my life
The good, the bad, the ugly too (Still waiting for you)
I take it all because the truth is
You, you are the love of my
You are the love of my life
My life
My-my-my, my-my-my, my-my-my life
My life

[Song 146: Be the Man (On This Night)]
8 ContributorsBe the Man (On This Night) Lyrics
I would fight not to ever fall too deep
Never sure that love would grow
Now at night as I lay me down to sleep
I could never let you go
And lying here with you, I still can't believe it's true
Never thought that I would ever find a love
That lasts forever

Be the man that's mine
Find the love that never goes away
Be the heart I know will be
The one that beats for me, be the man

Used to be scared if I would ever get this close
I'm not afraid to touch you now
Long before I knew, I'd be making love to you
I dreamed that maybe I would one day
Lose myself in someone, someday

Be the man that's mine
I always try to find the love that never goes away
Be the heart I know will be
The one that beats for me, be the man

Take me where I have never been
I will follow you, you'll never be alone
I will run, run to you
I never thought that I would ever find a love
That lasts forever

Be the man that's mine
I always try to find the love that never goes away
Tell me we will always be together
Make us stay in love this way forever
Be the heart I know will be
The one that beats for me
Wherever you may be
Always be with me, be the man

[Song 147: Destin 2]
4 ContributorsDestin 2 Lyrics[Verse 1[
There's no voile to my brother's shutters
There's no opal around my fingers
No cathedral where to hide my prayers
Just a little gold around my voice

I go the routes I go the borders
I smell, I listen, and I learn, I see
Time passes along time zones
I take, I give, had I the choice?

That's my destiny
I go along my route
That's how pass my hours
At my heart beats crazy rhythms

From summer fires I fly to dark winters
Autumn rains to Indian summer
Frozen grounds to dry deserts
I go I come, this world is mine
I live from notes and I live from light
I'm responding to all your cries, your hands
Life's taking me to it's mysteries' hollows
I my tomorrows in your eyes



I take blues from answering machines signals
I take sadness in airports
I live love at kilometers away
And happiness at my phone

[Song 148: Vole]
5 ContributorsVole LyricsVole vole, petite aile
Ma douce, mon hirondelle
Va t'en loin, va t'en sereine
Qu'ici rien ne te retienne
Rejoins le ciel et l'éther
Laisse-nous laisse la terre
Quitte manteau de misère
Change d'univers
Vole vole, petite sœur
Vole mon ange, ma douleur
Quitte ton corps et nous laisse
Qu'enfin ta souffrance cesse
Va rejoindre l'autre rive
Celle des fleurs et des rires
Celle que tu voulais tant
Ta vie d'enfant
Vole vole, mon amour
Puisque le nôtre est trop lourd
Puisque rien ne te soulage
Vole à ton dernier voyage
Lâche tes heures épuisées
Vole, tu l'as pas volé
Deviens souffle, sois colombe
Pour t'envoler

Vole vole, petite flamme
Vole mon ange, mon âme
Quitte ta peau de misère
Va retrouver, la lumière

[Song 149: All Because of You]
8 ContributorsAll Because of You Lyrics
Thought I could define it
One look in your eyes when it proved me wrong
I find myself speechless
This feeling of completeness is so strong
And I was convinced that my heart had reached it's limit
Until you created this new place in it

Your touch wraps around me
In love that knows no boundaries
Now, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
You're the answer I've been needing
Life has a whole new meaning, now
All because of you

Everything is different
There's no frame of a reference for the way I feel
But to look at your face
I am still amazed, I can't believe you're real
I can lie here forever just watching you sleep
Hanging on every breath that you breathe

Your touch wraps around me
In love that knows no boundaries
Now, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
You're the answer I've been needing
Life has a whole new meaning, now
All because of you
Your touch wraps around me
In love that knows no boundaries
Now, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
You're the answer I've been needing
Life has a whole new meaning, now
All because of you

In love that knows no boundaries
Now, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
You're the answer I've been needing
Life has a whole new meaning, now
All because of you

Your touch wraps around me
In love that knows no boundaries
Now, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
You're the answer I've been needing
Life has a whole new meaning, now, all because of you
All because of you...

[Song 150: Pere Noel Arrive Ce Soir]
5 ContributorsPere Noel Arrive Ce Soir Lyrics
J'ai vu dans la nuit passer un traineau
J'ai vu aussi ton grand ami
Pere Noel arrive ce soir
Il allait vers toi dans la cheminee
Il allait vers toi pour y deposer
Des jouets dans ton bas de soie

Et quand viendra le jour
Tu te leveras
Et puis tour a tour
Tu ouvriras tous les cadeaux que tu verras
Tu vas t'amuser
Tu vas rigoler
Mais il ne faudra pas oublier
D'etre sage toute l'annee


Et bien tu devras dormir
Sans faire aucun soupir
Meme si t'en as pas envie
Tu devras rester au lit
J'ai dans la nuit passer un traineau
J'ai vu aussi ton grand ami
Pere Noel arrive ce soir
Pere Noel arrive ce soir
