Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh

You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about (Yeah)

Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
(Work it out)

Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

I wanna try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Kiss it, ride it, can I fit it?
Charli likes boys, but she knows I'd hit it
(Knows I'd hit it)
Charli, call me if you're with it

(Yeah) Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess

You wanna guess what me and Billie have been textin' about? (We've been disrespectful)
Still tryin' to guess the password to my Google Drive (Are you obsessed with me?)
You wanna guess the address of the party we're at (You know you're not invited)
You wanna guess if we're serious about this song

Yeah, I don't know if you like me
Sometimes I think you might hate me
Sometimes I think I might hate you
Maybe you just wanna be me
You always say, "Let's go out"
So we go eat at a restaurant
Sometimes it feels a bit awkward
'Cause we don't have much in common

People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
We talk about making music
But I don't know if it's honest
Can't tell if you wanna see me
Falling over and failing
And you can't tell what you're feeling
I think I know how you feel

Girl, girl, girl, girl

Well, honestly, I was speechless
When I woke up to your voice note
You told me how you'd been feeling
Let's work it out on the remix
You'd always say, "Let's go out"
But then I'd cancel last minute
I was so lost in my head
And scared to be in your pictures
'Cause for the last couple years
I've been at war with my body
I tried to starve myself thinner
And then I gained all the weight back
I was trapped in the hatred
And your life seemed so awesome
I never thought for a second
My voice was in your head
"Girl, you walk like a bitch"
When I was ten, someone said that
And it's just self-defence
Until you're building a weapon
She believed my projection
And now I totally get it
Forgot that inside the icon
There's still a young girl from Essex

People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
It's you and me on the coin
The industry loves to spend
And when we put this to bed
The internet will go crazy
I'm glad I know how you feel
'Cause I ride for you, Charli (Charli, Charli)

I guess the apple don't fall far from the tree
'Cause I've been looking at you so long
Now I only see me
I wanna throw the apple into the sky
Feels like you never understand me
So I just wanna drive
To the airport, the airport
The airport, the airport

I guess the apple could turn yellow or green
I know there's lots of different nuances
To you and to me
I wanna grow the apple, keep all the seeds
But I can't help but get so angry
You don't listen, I leave
To the airport, the airport
The airport, the airport
The airport, the airport
The airport, the airport

(Yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night
I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night

I think the apple's rotten right to the core
From all the things passed down
From all the apples coming before
I split the apple down symmetrical lines
And what I find is kinda scary
Makes me just wanna drive

One voice tells me that they laugh
George says I'm just paranoid
Says he just don't see it, he's so naive
I'm embarrassed to have it, but need the sympathy

'Cause I couldn't even be her if I tried
I'm opposite, I'm on the other side
I feel all these feelings I can't control
Oh no, don't know why
All this sympathy is just a knife
Why I can't even grit my teeth and lie?
I feel all these feelings I can't control
Oh no, don't know

Why I wanna buy a gun?
Why I wanna shoot myself?
Volatilе at war with my dialogue
I'd say that there was a God if thеy could stop this
Wild voice tearing me apart
I'm so apprehensive now
Don't wanna see her backstage at my boyfriend's show
Fingers crossed behind my back
I hope they break up quick

'Cause I couldn't even be her if I tried
I'm opposite, I'm on the other side

Always on my mind (Every day, every night)
Your star burns so bright (Why did I push you away?)
I was scared sometimes
You had a power like a lightning strike
When I'm on stage sometimes I lie
Say that I like singing these songs you left behind
And I know you always said, "It's okay to cry"
So I know I can cry, I can cry, so I cry

Wish I'd tried to pull you closer
You pushed me hard, made me focus
Your words, brutal, loving, truthful
I was petrified
You're a hero and a human
Track was done, I'd make excuses
You'd say, "Come on, stay for dinner"
I'd say, "No, I'm fine" (Now I really wish I'd stayed)

Always on my mind (Every day, every night)
Your star burns so bright (Why did I push you away?)
I was scared sometimes
You had a power like a lightning strike
When I'm on stage, sometimes I lie
Say that I like singing these songs you left behind
And I know you always said, "It's okay to cry"
So I know I can cry, I can cry, so I cry

Guilty feelings keep me fractured
Got a phone call after Christmas
Didn't know how I should act
I watched you dance online
Your sounds, your words live on, endless
When I make songs, I remember
Things you'd suggest, "Make it faster"
Would you like this one? (Maybe just a little bit?)

Always on my mind (Every day, every night)
Your star burns so bright (Why did I push you away?)
I was scared sometimes
You had a power like a lightning strike
When I'm on stage, sometimes I lie
Say that I like singing these songs you left behind
And I know you always said, "It's okay to cry"
So I know I can cry, I can cry, so I cry

All coquette-ish in the pictures with the flash on
Worships Lana Del Rey in her AirPods, yeah

Hedonistic with the gravel drawl and dead eyes
You said she's anorexic and you heard she likes when people say it
Think you already know her, but you don't

Yeah, it's 4 a.m., and she's out there
With the razor-sharp tongue stuck to skinny cigarettes
Calls him Daddy while she's fingering a gold cross
And she's kinda fucked up, but she's still in Vogue
Yeah, she's in her mid-twenties, real intelligent
And you hate the fact she's New York City's darling
You said she's problematic and the way you say it, so fanatic
Think she already knows that you're obsessed

I see myself (Myself), and I look scared and confused
Wait, did they just talk? Why is it too loud? (Is it loud?)
Do they wish to run through me? (Me)
Am I a smoke? Am I the sun? And who decides? (Oh)

I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me feel lately
They making me weird, baby, lately
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me loathe
They making me loathe, oh, mmm (Yeah)

Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?

Love suicide
You and I drove for miles
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
We took a dive in the blue, scared to lose
All my feelings, feelings, feelings for you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you

Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head (In my head...)

I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever
I know in the future (Future)
We won't see each other (We won't see each other)
Cold just like December
But I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

Head, in my head

You take your time, I'll take mine, we'll be fine
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
When the roof caved in and the water fell through
Hope when we're old, we'll be friends, reminisce
Hope we'll be there, be there, be there, us two
All the memories, all the photos we took

Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head

I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever

I think it's almost 4 AM but baby I'm still feelin' just fine
Ice all up in a plastic cup and I'ma keep on sippin' all night, yeah
I might've kissed a thousand lips, but maybe that's just all in my mind
Some people never understand the way we live but we're livin' life

Uh huh, hey, uh huh, Monday to Sunday, it's never too late
So everyone say, "We don't wanna stop!"

'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, the neighbors might complain
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna stay 'til mornin'
Then when the time is up, we'll do it all again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're all in love
We're all in love

I'm hangin' on my best friend's couch and my clothes are all on the floor
I got glitter in my underwear like it was Studio 54, yeah
I can't remember why I love it, but I need it baby, clap, bring on the encore
Let's pour another drink, the glasses go *clink*
Yeah, we're always up for one more

Uh huh, hey, uh huh, Monday to Sunday, it's never too late

'Cause after the afterparty (Afterparty)
We're gonna stay 'til mornin' (Stay 'til mornin')
Then when the time is up, we'll do it again (Oh yeah, oh, Lil Boat!)

The party just ended but I'm not done with you
But my folks are out of town, we got a crib with a view
Y'all come over, bring a couple friends, I keep mine with me
Shouts out to Whitney, she was so wicked
The party was so crazy, oh
The party was so crazy, oh
Tomorrow I'll be lazy
But I'll spend it with you baby

Monday to Sunday, doin' it our way
RiRi on replay, cheers to the weekday
We're all in, we're all in love, yeah
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
And we do it like ice cream for dinner
Bucket of liquor, we're getting sicker
Don't need Ibiza
We're all in, we're all in love, yeah
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
And we do it like
Monday to Sunday, doin' it our way

I think about it all the time
That I might run out of time
But I finally met my baby
And a baby might be mine
'Cause maybe one day I might
If I don't run out of time
Would it give my life a new purpose? (Mmm)

I was walking around in Stockholm
Seriously thinking 'bout my future for the first time
It was ice-cold, playing demos on my iPhone
I went to my friend's place and I met their baby for the first time
How sublime
What a joy, oh my, oh my
Standing there
Same old clothes she wore before, holding her child, yeah
She's a radiant mother, and he's a bеautiful father
And now they both know thesе things that I don't

I think about it all the time
That I might run out of time
But I finally met my baby
And a baby might be mine
'Cause maybe one day I might
If I don't run out of time
Would it make me miss all my freedom?
I think about it all the time
I-I think about it all the time
That I might run out of time
But I finally met my baby
And a baby might be mine
'Cause maybe one day I might

Would it give my life a new purpose?
I think about it all the time

Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm

And they're exactly the same, but they're different now
And I'm so scared I'm missin' out on something
So, we had a conversation on the way home
Should I stop my birth control?
'Cause my career feels so small
In the existential scheme of it all

Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm (Ti-i-ime)
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm

Need my fingerprints on everything

Am I playing back time?
Did I lose my perspective?

I could say something smart
But might say something stupid
(Talk to myself in the mirror)
I get so cold (So cold)
I don't know if I belong here anymore

Rot in your house in a tie
Putting my skin into anything
I eat a lot like a fly
I get nervous and sip the wine
Don't worry, it's pretty common
It happens to lots of guys
Medicine makes me a problem
"I'm famous, but I'm not quite"

Rot in my house in L.A.
Thinkin' of givin' up everything
Now I'm watchin' what I say
These interviews are so serious
My friends went through this before, yeah

Talk to myself in the mirror
Wear these clothes as disguise
Just to re-enter the party
Door is open, let in but still outside
I look perfect for the background
I get nervous, sip the wine

I go so cold, I go so cold
'Cause I don't know if I belong here anymore, I

I don't feel like nothing special
I snag my tights out on the lawn chair
Guess I'm a mess and play the role
Used to live just for the party
Door is open, I'm famous but not quite
But I'm perfect for the background
Onе foot in a normal life

I go so cold, I go so cold

Now I wanna think about all the good times
First met on the outskirts of Stockholm
All of your things in a black suitcase
First day, made Vroom Vroom in the basement
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Head bop hard with your arm up, dancing
Hot pink jacket on, music turned up
Bounce that track, make us late to the party
Now I wanna think about all the good times
First time I ever felt alive on stage
In Texas, in matching latex
That's as cool as I'm ever gonna feel
(Beautiful)

Now I wanna think about all the good times
Me and A.G. on Mulholland
Crazy Uber, straight from a video shoot
Got birthday cake on the way
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Best night ever in Arcosanti
So many friends right there in the audience
When I look back, what the fuck was I wearing?
Now I wanna think about all the good times
One big smile cracked the whole world open
Sipping green juice, looking so chic
Soft response while you play with the tension
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Like when we took Bibi down to Bubbles
Took our shoes off, ran around barefoot
Played that song we made that day
Now I wanna think about all the good times
DJ set back to back with Twiggy
She was nervous, you were so nice
Said you had the best time with her
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Me and Noonie cried to your songs
No songs ever made us feel that much
Can't explain 'cause it's just too much
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Talking on Zoom in 2020
Red hair brushed out, sat back home
Lyrics back and forth from texts
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Like the first time I heard your music
My ex-boyfriend played your SoundCloud
That moment really changed my life

(No, no, no)
(No, no, no-o-o-o)

No birthday, but I'm cakin'
I shake it like I'm tryna get the oil off of the bacon
If I need wakin', I'ma alarm that shakin'
This ass 'bout to move like I need the house vacant
It move, move, move, and you know it won't stop
It shakin' like I'm pulled over by a white cop
It shakin' like a virgin, 'bout to give up the box
Told 'em this ass a miracle, like my name Watts
I be purgin' shit, never nervous, bitch
I get on top of that dick, shake it like turbulence
You haven't heard from 'em since, I'm a different expense
And now this pussy need Staples like I'm fuckin' on Vince
Told 'em paddle, paddle, paddle 'cause this pussy in Seattle
I'ma fight my own battles, shake it harder than a rattle
He get in it, then he tackle, wanna bite it like a apple
And this pussy so juicy, when I cum it's made of Snapple, ayy

Brooke muthafuckin' Candy, Charli XCX
Miss CupcakKe is on this muthafuckin' track, oh

Tell me what you want, tell me what you want, daddy
Little bit of sugar, little bit of Brooke Candy
Cocaine-colored sheets where my ass bouncin' (Bounce)
'Bout to turn your mansion to the pussy palace
And shake it on ya like my ass on the Richter scale
My pussy crucify your body, it's the holy grail
My pussy lean, I got you sippin' from the two cup
I'm 'bout to shake my ass like I'm in a strip club
Hey, my ass is Magic City
Double Ds, all-natural big titties
Shake it like a box-fresh vibrator
Ass first-class, fast like Concorde
Damn, my ass so insane
Put me in a straightjacket, still you ain't safe
You can't handle all the jelly, put it on a plate
I'm 'bout to shake and leave you shook, like Beyoncé

Oh darling, you say you don't know me?

Pra começar direito eu soletro pra você
Rainha se escreve com dois L e dois T
Como estagiário no trabalho, eu tô sem tempo
Se tenho um problema eu resolvo com talento
Dedinho na boca, sou uma tentação
A pista pega fogo derretendo o paredão
Já mostrei que eu sou queen, falo sério pra vocês
A coroa é pesada, mas eu me acostumei
I shake it, I shake it, o meu popozão
Achei que, achei que aguentasse a pressão
Do MA, cheguei em LA
É a Pabllo e a Charli mais uma vez

I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh

Sometimes, I just wanna rewind
Sometimes (Sometimes, sometimes), I just wanna rewind

I'd go back in time to when I wasn't insecure
To when I didn't overanalyse my face shape
Nowadays, I only eat at the good restaurants
But, honestly, I'm always thinking 'bout my weight
I used to never feel embarrassed (Feel embarrassed)
When I call up the paparazzi
Everyone else does it constantly
I hate these doubts that keep running through my mind
Sometimes, I really think it would be cool to rewind

Sometimes, I just wanna rewind
Sometimes (Sometimes, sometimes), I just wanna rewind

Used to burn CDs full of songs I didn't know
Used to sit in my bedroom, putting polish on my toes
Recently, I've been thinking 'bout a way simpler time
Sometimes, I really think it would be cool to rewind
I used to never think about Billboard
But, now, I've started thinking again
Wondering 'bout whether I think I deserve commercial success
It's running through my mind
Sometimes, I really think it would be cool to rewind

Sometimes, I just wanna rewind
Sometimes (Sometimes, sometimes), I just wanna rewind

Sometimes, —times
Ooh, mm
Sometimes, I just wanna rewind
Wanna turn back time to a different time, oh
Sometimes

But every single night
When I cut off the lights
I feel like crying
Your picture revolving in my mind
But then it turns to white
I guess I’ll go in blind
I feel like crying
Hope you can forgive all of my crimes
You read, but won't reply
I just need your reply
I feel like crying
Baby, all I need's a single night
A sign, a sign, give me a sign

Sorry I broke you down
Sorry I tore your heart
I ripped it all apart
Your headlights in the dark
Sorry ’bout Grammy night
Was flyin' out my mind
Was in a different place
Tortured and drifting by
Kept dancing in that house
The windows turned to black
My windows turned to black
My eyes were rolling back, yeah
Hope I get one more chance
Hope I get one more call
I only know what's good once I have lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all

(I think about it all the time, that I might run out of time)
Why do you choose to move?
('Cause maybe one day I might)
I'll take your silences
Fix 'em for customs, the signals makе motion
You're lonely and you're (Scarеd to run out of time)

Yeah (When did it get so hard? When did it get so hard?)

First off, you're bound to the album
Then you're locked into the promo
Next thing, three years have gone by (Scared to run out of time)
Me and George sit down and try to plan for our future
But there's so much guilt involved when we stop working
'Cause you're not supposed to stop when things start working, no

I found love, baby
But I was scared to run out of time
I think about it all the time
Was I made for this? I'm
Confused with all these feelings
I'm confused what's on my mind
When I make a sacrifice
Just in the nick of time
I'm so scared to run out of time

Oh, baby
I found love, I found
Does it all have to be so hard?
Sittin' here (When did it get so hard?)

And I'm exactly the same, but I'm older now
And I got even more stress on my body
So we had a conversation on the way home, "Should I stop my birth control?
'Cause my career still feels small in the existential scheme of it all"

I'll tell you (Yeah), I folded up
My friends say (Yeah) I've fallen off
I'd be scared (Nothing's in your way)
Aren't you scared?

I'm so scared to run out of time

Baby on my arm
Your favorite pop star is into me, Yung Lean, and Charli
Know you wanna dream like Lean, wanna be like Lean
But it's not as easy as it seems
Who do I trust? Me
We put this shit together so carelessly

Hey, why you do it so cold?
They say I'm the realest ever, yeah
That's what I've been told
Killin' this shit since 1994
We do this one night, yeah, we do it for our lives

'Cause we got that supersonic, push up on it
Right in your ear
I got that supersonic, starship, comet
Right over here (Yeah)
I'm in my Elvis moment, push up on it
Right over there
I got that supersonic, push up on it
Right in your ear (Let's go)

Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump, in the rave

Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat

Flame burning, tire screech
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever and
Drop, body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speedin' on the highway
Vroom vroomin', might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius

I'll be your femmebot
I'll be your...

Go fuck your prototype
I'm an upgrade of your stereotype
Don't come with a guarantee
I'll use you up like you're my battery

I feel the sparks between us
Electric shock
Hot-wired, if you mess it up
I'll self-destruct

The way you look at me
I-I-I short circuit
You make me lose control
It's automatic
You push my buttons
See-e-e-e how I work it
I-I-I-I get what I want
Like it or not

I'll be your femmebot
I'll be your femmebot
I'll be your femmebot
I-I get what I want
Like it or not

I got you hypnotized (Hypnotized)
I read your thoughts when you look in my eyes
You're just my human toy (Human toy)
And I am programmed to search and destroy

I feel the sparks between us
Electric shock
Hot-wired, if you F it up (Five, four, three)
I'll self-destruct (Two, one)

The way you look at me

You make me lose control

I'll be your femmebot
I'll be your femmebot
I-I get what I want
Like it or not

Ghost in a shell
I'm a beast in the sheets
I'm a neutron bomb-bomb, blowin' the beat
Gonna spray that raygun and fall to his knees
I'm a lightnin' rod, I'ma bite that bod
Do you want a femmebot or do you want a ho-bot?
Slut-bot, fuck no, systems down
Boy, I'll clone you, boy, I'll swerve you
Glitch your mainframe, now I own you
Ex Machina-na-na, you can't win
I'm A.I. fly, I am that bitch
Is your love for real though?
I'm Trinity, you're Neo
I'm bionic, not ironic
Super Saiyan, supersonic
Hard drive crash, you don't remember
Charli bit yo wittle finga

I'll be your femmebot

Hard to read, you could be OCD
You could be bad for me, you could say anything
Sometimes I get a bit TMI, little bit scared of heights
Little afraid to say
You know the things that make me smile
The face I make before my tears fall down
The things that I feel when you're acting suspicious
You know the place I run to hide
I take my problems there to work ’em out

The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

Look at us, isn't it obvious?
Is it so dangerous? Is it so complicated?
You know the shapes my body makes
Under the sheets at 4 AM with you
The things that we break when we’re switchin' positions
You know the words to my mistakes
You understand because you made 'em too

The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

All of the things that we sometimes forget
All of the dreams that you put in my head
I'm still asleep, but there's breakfast in bed
These are the things that could make us official
Maybe the sky might not always be blue
All of my wishes will never come true
It doesn't matter 'cause I’m here with you
This stuff could make us official
So tell all your friends ’cause we're goin’ official

Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official
These are the things that could make us official
These are the things that could make us official
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet

What you want

What you want
What you want
I ain't got it

I ain't got it

I don't know why I got a tendency to run away
Don't know why I'm always pushing for a sweet escape
Even though I feel so close, I just can't control how I feel
And I gotta be free, need to breathe

But sometimes I need all night, all day
We could fall in love in new shapes
New shapes
And when the morning comes
I'm sorry, I stayed
Tell you honestly, I can't change, can't change

What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
What you want
I ain't got it

What if I created places for you to let go?
What if you wanted to watch because we both know?
That now we are so close
We don't have to fight how we feel
When the lights and the skins arе cold

I surrender to it all night, all day (All night, baby)
Then wе fall in love in new shapes (New shapes, baby)
New shapes
When the morning comes all misty, we fade (Misty, baby)
'Cause we fell in love in new shapes (What?)
In new shapes, oh

What you want
I ain't got it (Got it)
What you want (We could go on)
What you want
I ain't got it
I ain't got it

Thinkin' of me, but you're stuck on the west side again
Maybe we're meant for another dimension, babe
Deep in the dark of your brain like a star in space
You call it art, but you pulled on my heart
And you twisted it into a new shape
Yeah, I'm dive bar-ing again and again
Trying to get up close to you
Fucked if I know how it's gonna end
But honestly, life would be better if I never
Met you in the first place

What you want (Oh)
I ain't got it (Yeah)
What you want (I ain't got it)

I ain't got it (Charli, Caroline, Chris)

Not supposed to feel this way, I'm such a hypocrite
I always frown on love, it's giving me a tummy-ache
(All these butterflies make me sick) Make me fly away
(It's some hocus pocus shit, I'm bewitched) Fly away

Calling too much, you're breaking my phone
Mad when you do and sad when you don't
Chivalry, ooh, you taking my coat
Too cute, no, this ain't me now
Candlelight
Out on a starry night
You brush my hair to the side
And you tell me I'm pretty

Yuck, now you got me blushin'
Cheeks so red when the blood starts rushing
Yuck, that boy's so mushy
Sending me flowers, I'm just tryna get lucky
Yuck, lookin' at me all sucky
Yuck, quit acting like a puppy
Fuck, going all lovey-dovey on me (All lovеy-dovey on me)

You got your hopes high, thinking 'bout it most nights
Put mе on a pedestal 'cause my love's incredible
Don't wait up for me
I can't make those plans, catch me if you can (Come catch me)
Just flew into Japan, come catch me (But don't you catch feels, that's so—)

Yuck, now you got me blushin'
Cheeks so red when the blood starts rushing
Yuck, that boy's so mushy
Sending me flowers, I'm just tryna get lucky
Yuck, lookin' at me all sucky

Maybe I need a reality check
Sometimes now I just gotta say less
Count so well, drew lines on my chest

Gotta get more, living all excess
I must confess, I'm under stress

Thinking how to move like chess (Yeah, yeah)

Wanna see my face all up in the press
When I don't, sometimes I get a little bit depressed (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

Throwin' all the china all around the kitchen

You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason (No, no)
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

Tell me the reason (Yeah)
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

Tell me what you want
'Cause I know that you're lonely on your own
We're out in L.A. for a month
I don't think I can hide my emotions no, no more (Uh-huh)
A late night, say you want me, say you're selfish
Think about my body, then two-time
Say you want her? Do you want her?
Doesn't do it like me, no
So hot, burn the place down
Give you what you need

So you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
(Why we can't fall in love)

Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

Make me wanna fall in love
Baby, make mistakes
Hit me with a champagne kiss
And now I'm not thinkin' straight
Look at the skyline high
I look up, I wish I saw your face
I wanna fall in love
Jump in the deep end
'Cause deep down, you're d-dying
Tell me you're kinda nervous
Tell me you feel the same
I wish it was more than surface
I wish I could feel nothing
Come give me everything
Burn down and go again

So you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
And you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

Ooh, baby
Why, why, why
Tell me, tell me, tell me the reason
Know you lie, what do you want
Tell me, tell me, tell me the reason
Fall in love, ah, risk it all, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason, oh yeah
You gotta tell me the reason
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason

[Song 82: visions]
52 ContributorsTranslationsPolskivisions Lyrics
Visions in the past
Turbulence right from the start
Tearing up your heart
You and I, we really went dark

Voices tell me hold on
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close
Grippin' to you so hard
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close, but

I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all so bright
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all the time
I see you
Visions comin' every night
You can call me so crazy, following that light
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, and it looks so right
I see you

Can't change what I feel
Never seen the future so real
But maybe I'm just fantasizing
Finally think I'm realizing

All these voices tell me hold on
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close
Grippin' to you so hard
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close, but

I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all so bright
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all the time
Visions comin' every night
You can call me so crazy, following that light
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind

I got pictures in my mind
I got pictures in my mind
I got pictures in my mind

You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
You, you, you, you

You had me 'round your finger, you had me on the floor
I used to be your angel, now I'm walking out your door
You say I'm turnin' evil, I'll say I'm finally pure
Shine bright in my reflection, think I lost myself before

Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life, 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standin' in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh
You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh

I'm like a flower blooming since I left you behind
Don't know what I was doing, thought your venom was divine
Knew you were turnin' evil, you said I lost my mind
No, you ain't gonna do me like that-at-at-at

Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life, 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy (So)
I'm finally free from your control (Control)
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh

Do you feel alright?
Do you need me by your side?
We go out all night
Makes the pain hurt a little less
Do it one more time
'Cause it feels so justified

See you fall, pick you up again

If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too
You got me so overprotective, it's true
Feel like I would jump off buildings for you
It's okay, I'll watch you cry all night
I promise I won't let you go

I'll pull you close, so close, so close

Head on my chest, a silver cross

Do you feel okay?
Take a breath, make you feel safe

If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too

Baby, you got it
You know I want it

Calling out for your love
Baby, I’m calling out, I can’t do without you
Put ecstasy on my tongue and that’s all I’m tasting now
You’re luxurious, I’m stuck
Champagne, cigarettes, convertibles
It’s ‘bout to pop off
Bitin' on a rose, you make me cum
I’m way up, rooftop
You hurt me when you stop
I just can’t get enough, dealer

Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like
Baby, you got it
You know I want it
You're selling all the drugs that I like
Baby, you the love of my life
Baby, you got it
You know I want it

I was never great at dealing with no comedown
So feel free to come 'round when you wanna come 'round
You’re my favourite drug, just take me to your underworld
And put me on your tongue, hallucinate until your toes curl
Tsu-tsunami, you can’t stop me now, I’m peaking too
Off the kiki and hypnotic, I’m not through with you
When you cum, it feels like diamonds raining down on me
When I’m with you, heaven on Earth is not a fantasy
Roll the windows down, my wrists awry, you got me so cold
Bitin' on a flower, blood like water down from my nose
It hurts, but I can’t stop
I just can’t get enough
(I can’t get enough)

Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like
(Selling all the drugs that I like)
Baby, you got it
You know I want it (Yeah)
And baby, you the love of my life

[Song 93: Hello goodbye]
46 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoPolskiEspañolFrançaisPortuguêsΕλληνικάDeutschTürkçeРусский (Russian)ČeskyHello goodbye Lyrics
I don't know what's going on
Most of the time I'm out my mind
A nervous wreck
I said, "Goodbye," and not "Hello"
Don't even know

Felt a little fear and some anxiety
The second you arrived and kind of smiled at me
My heart began to rise
I panicked quietly, so silently

I said, "Goodbye" before you came
I turned around and ran away
I was too scared, I should have said
"Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello"
I said, "Goodbye" before you came
I turned around and ran away
I fеlt too scared, I should have said
"Hello, hеllo, hello, hello, hello, hello"

Now I'm all up in my head
Replaying all my worst regrets
I shot myself, I'm born to lose
Now all I do is think 'bout you

Felt a little fear and some anxiety
The second you arrived and kind of smiled at me
My heart began to rise
I'm freaking quietly, so silently (Ooh)

I said, "Goodbye" before you came
I turned around and ran away
I was too scared, I should have said
"Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello"
I said, "Goodbye" before you came
I turned around and ran away
I felt too scared, I should have said
"Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello"

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
Goodbye
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
Goodbye
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
I really don't know why-y-y-y

I said, "Goodbye" before you came
I turned around and ran away
I was too scared, I should have said
"Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello"
I said, "Goodbye" before you came
I turned around and ran away
I felt too scared, I should have said

Drivin' 'round in Hollywood, I can only think 'bout you
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my body, it's you
Did I lose it all? Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now or are they far gone?
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all
Can't stop thinking 'bout you

Fucked up, I just wanna break glass
Phone calls, I just wanna talk back
Yeah, big attitude, just like a big stack
Braindead for days, am I gonna relapse? Yeah

I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna smile, no, no
Got a couple problems
I don't wanna compromise, no, no (Yeah)

I already know I'm letting go of something sacred
Drive us off the road, I take a good thing
And I break it
Think it's in my soul, the way I run from something real
No, I ain't changing
Wish I could surrender, give you everything I got
And let you know

It's something 'bout the way you move me
Yeah, yeah
It's something 'bout the way you save my life

Something 'bout the way you
Hold my body tight even on my lowest nights
Locked down by my side
Even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away
It's something 'bout the way you

Call it what you want, I got a habit for destruction
Take all of your trust and then betray it like it's nothing
Yeah, I think it's in my soul, the way I run from something real and leave you wondering (Wondering)
Why I can't surrender, give you everything I got and let you know

It's something 'bout the way you move me
Yeah, yeah
It's something 'bout the way you save my life

Something 'bout the way you
Hold my body tight even on my lowest nights
Locked down by my side

Hold my body tight even on my lowest night
Locked down by my side even when I'm borderline

When I met you it was tragic
Chemistry something like magic
You were with somebody else long term
And I was with somebody else as well
Met up late night by the Bowery
And in the morning we got coffee
Acting like strangers, and told no friends
It wasn't easy to pretend

And we know that it's wrong, but it feels real fun
Sneakin' around, fallin' deep in love
But sometimes I get scared
'Cause I know it's unfair
I'm hurting someone else instead

I'm breakin' every rule for you
You're breakin' every rule for me
I'm breakin' every rule for you
But I've gotta say
I want it this way

Conversation never borin'
When your lips brushed up against my skin
All I wanted was to let you in
I wonder if people will notice
Said you find it so hard to focus
Cigarettes up on the balcony
Wrapped up in nothing but sheets

And we know that it's wrong
But it feels real fun
Sneakin' around, fallin' deep in love
But sometimes I get scared
'Cause I know it's unfair
I'm hurtin' someone else instead

Falling through the clouds

When you go, please don't leave your love in the sun
My heart will melt away
In the night, with your twisted tongue
When you drop the bomb, I'm blown away

'Cause I refuse to hide in the page of your story
I come out the box, I won't say I'm sorry

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this though
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

Now I'm facing this on my own
'Cause you taste the blast and it shook your bones
I'm a warrior all alone
In the field of lies, I won't go home

'Cause I, gonna burn my skin in the blaze of glory
I will come out your hands, I won't say I'm sorry

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter, I'll survive this though

We survive, nuclear seasons

I can feel it, I can feel the fear
I can feel it, inside of us all

Wish you could see me when I'm lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red (Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again
Wish you could see me when I'm lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red (Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again

(Let my car run out) Let my car run out
(I won't scream or shout) I won't scream or shout
(Let's die together) 'Cause I feel like I'm in heaven
(No one lasts forever) Dancing with an angel
(Let my car run out) Cars burn out
(I won't scream or shout) Lost my breath now
(Let's die together) 'Cause it feels like I am
(No one lasts forever) Falling through the clouds

(Let my car run out, I won't scream or shout)
Hope we're on the same wavelength
Hope you don't think that I'm crazy
(Let's die together, no one lasts forever)
Beaches and oceans for my baby
Hurry up, and come and save me
(Let my car run out, I won't scream or shout)
I can't quite hear what you're saying
Because my body started shaking
(Let's die together, no one lasts forever)
Beaches and oceans, earth is quaking
That's my heart that you were breaking

Wish you could see me when I'm lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red (Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again
Wish you could see me when I'm lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red (Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again

(Let my car run out) Cars burn out
(I won't scream or shout) Lost my breath now
(Let's die together) 'Cause it feels like I am
(No one lasts forever) Falling through the clouds

Hope we’re on the same wavelength
Hope you don’t think that I'm crazy
Beaches and oceans for my baby
Hurry up, and come and save me
I can't quite hear what you're saying
Because my body started shaking
Beaches and oceans, earth is quaking
That's my heart that you were breaking

(No one lasts forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever)

Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart
Uh, uh, Brooke Candy

We were on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
Kept the blunts rolled, always let you take the first hit
When the feds caught us, I said I would take the rap
'Cause I knew it ain't easy livin' life in the trap
I was the Queen B and you were like my Jay Z
Only one who held me down when I was fuckin' crazy
Ivana and Trump, shit, we coulda ran the world
You were my Chris Brown, I was your only girl
Let you put your feet up while I was cookin' you breakfast
Thought I found my ride or die, but now I just regret shit
Log into your email 'cause I knew that shit was wrong
Pullin' up a private photo of a bitch showin' her thong
Then I look a lil' closer, it's my home girl Lisa
Time to terminate shit, hasta la vista
Married to the mob, so I put a hit on it
Handed you my heart, then you took a shit on it
That's fucked up

Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart

Now I'ma fuck your shit up
Set fire to your pick-up
And drive it super sonic
Crash and burn it with my sister
No, I don't need a mister
Cancel the babysitter
I'm never going down that road
It's easy to resist ya

You broke my heart
And I'm never gon' forget this
You broke my heart
And now I'm comin' back to get ya, don't you know?

Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart
Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart

I'm gonna stay here, 'cause I love you too
'Cause I love you too

I don’t talk a lot, talk a lot
So you should listen up, I mean it when I say

Good girls shouldn't party

Get home, be in bed by two

All over, deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control

Both got the feelin’
Hit like karate
Had boyfriends and girlfriends
We wanted to touch, but we could never make any moves
Both got the feelin’
Guilty desire
Your body, my body
We were close, but still so far away

When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin’ right from wrong, tellin’ right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it’s so emotional

All over, deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional

The car in the driveway
The questions in her mouth
This secret is risky
So we have to keep all these fantasies to ourselves
Clothes on the carpet
Over at my house
I wish we could do it
We came so close, but still we push away

When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin’ right from wrong, tellin’ right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it’s so emotional

You're whiskey-wasted and beautiful dancing through the fire
You're such a vision to see
I used to think that the power of love was just a song
But now it's got hold of me

S.O.S, is it me, or is this dangerous?
Kill me with your touch
You're smoking through my blood
R.I.P, set me free, yeah, this is dangerous
I can't get enough

When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

Feels like I'm tripping, I'm falling hard from the highest heights
When I crash, where will you be?
I think your hair looks much better pushed over to one side
How do you feel about me?

S.O.S, this is real, and this is dangerous
You're my favorite drug, I'll smoke you in the club
R.I.P., what a dream, you're so damn dangerous
I can't get enough

When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love

So give me all of your super love
I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

Oh-oh

I tell good lies when they ask me
But I cried all night in the backseat
No one knows what I feel inside (I used to know what I wanted)
My tears fell down at the party
Like water all on my body
No one knows when I'm really alright

I pulled apart my feelings so raw (Oh, yeah)
Voices shout so loud, can't ignore (Every night, every night, yeah)
I used to think I knew what I wanted
I'm high enough from all the high pressure
I just wanna make myself better on—

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday

I broke down in Paris (Yeah)
Tried to hide my emotions (Come home)
All flew out my body (Yeah)
But then I cried hard in the hotel
Did that show in London
And I passed out at the party
It doesn't make me happy
How can I not know what I need right now?

Pulled apart my feelings so raw (Yeah, yeah)
Voices shout so loud, can't ignore (Every night, every night, yeah)
I used to think I knew what I wanted (I used to know what I wanted)
But I don't wanna feel the high pressure
I just wanna make myself better on—

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday

Stepped in the club

Runnin' away from cops

We're wild and free, and I believe

Kissin' your lips and feeling electric
Fantasy blurrin' purple and green
Dancin' with you on top of the mountain

Stay away, won't you just stay away?

Taking all my light and blocking out my vision
Bad little girl, years trapped in the prison
On my hands, on my knees, pulled on the chains
Licking up the blood, yeah, I made this decision

You took my light, trapped in the prison
You threw away the key
You are the curse, I am the captive
Walking on hands and knees

Never learn, never learn
Never learned, never learn

I knew you were no angel
But God, you're just electric blue

Do you remember what I said that first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?

I hear you call for me
But you're not there, you're just an echo
Why did you fall for me?

Do you remember what I said that first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone, but now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

Taking all my light and blocking out my vision

Gimme the poison
I love the poison
Hooked on the poison

I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I drank the poison

Get out my head, get out my bed
I don't believe those three words that you said
Pocket of lies, crystal blue eyes
Hit the ground hard when I dropped from the skies
You're coming up when I'm going down
Never in sync, so we just sank and drowned
Press restart and reboot my heart
But I'm not a robot, so I fell apart
Before the moment we met, we were chatting on the internet
Getting kinda close through the posts that we were lookin' at
I was pretty confident, you were pretty into that
I linked you to my music just to see if you'd be into it
So fuck the prologue, read the internet blogs
Gonna love this style and I came from the clubs
I wasn't looking for a thug, I was looking for a bad boy
Bad boy, motherfucker, destroy

I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I drank the poison
I want the poison, I need the poison
Gimme the poison, I love the poison
Hooked on the poison

(So far away...
So long ago, and so far away
So far away...
So long ago, and so far away)

Now I know for sure that we've got to end this
You don't get no last kiss
'Cause you're so damn crazy
And I'm so damn helpless
So don't text my number
And don't call my mother
I can't see your face now
'Cause this is over

I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I drank the poison

You're so damn cold
You got no feeling
I want my blood hotter
Not satisfied
I need to taste it
Your sex is so over

Got the gun in my hand and I point it straight
To the target and I'm gonna blow my brains
I don't need you, my touch is better
I'm rolling much hotter

Lights out, I'm on
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I can make it feel just like I'm hanging on
Yeah, I can do it better when I'm all alone
Lights out, so high
All alone
I got a body of my own

I'm in control
My hands are shaking
My skin's getting wetter
I'm coming close
It's overloaded
I walk in with fire

Spin around in my head, I'm screaming out
But with you in the room I can never shout
This heroin, I'm sinking so deep
Wish I could stay here forever

Lights out, I'm on
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I can make it feel just like I'm hanging on
Yeah, I can do it better when I'm all alone
Lights out, so high
All alone
I got a body of my own

Lights out
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I'm gone, so high

You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt's on the floor

You know just what I like
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt's on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

Used to come around, you'd be knockin' on my front door
Playing board-games, horror films with the super gore
Thought that you were cute from the start
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
You were like the medicine, the medicine, I wanted more
All along, I wanted someone to vibe with
Found the guy I want the rest of my life with
Ha, we on some husband and wife shit
I don't really care, 'cause I know that I like it

And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart's been broken
We'll be sitting on your bedroom floor still smoking
And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart's been broken
We'll be sitting on your bedroom floor still smoking
Smoking, smoking

You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again

Oh, well, now I got a plan
I hope you gonna be my man
I can see us cushy in the house right by the ocean sand
And when I wanna cry, I hope you're gonna hold my hand
And when the shit goes down, I hope you're gonna make a stand (Yeah)
This shit is super wild, this shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangsta, I think I'm into you (Yeah)
This shit is super wild, this shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangsta, I think I'm into you

I talked to you the way I talk to myself

Stopped saying "thank you" when I needed your help
But still I'm taking you for granted and that's not right

I never really listen
But when you're gone a part of me is missing
I know it's complicated, we both feel the distance
I really hope that you'll forgive me one day

I'm sorry if I hurt you

I'm sorry if I hurt you
I only make it worse
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you

Floatin' in an atmosphere, hiding from the truth in fear
Slowly we both disappeared, now it seems so crystal clear
So in denial
Oh, yeah

You never really listen
And when I'm gone a part of you is missing
I know it's complicated letting go of feelings
I really hope that you'll forgive me one day

I'm sorry if I hurt you

I am just crushed in the velvet
My heart is locked in a box
I am still sinking in black skylines
But now I want it to stop

I’m sailing high but I can't see
I’ve been pushed around, up and down in a cloud
And I can't breathe
I’m falling down, down to my knees
You've gotta let me go, you've gotta help me out
You've gotta set me free

You've gotta set me free
Yeah, you devoured my soul
‘Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It’s crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
‘Cause you can feel my pain

You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain

I have been dancing with shadows
I have been calling your name (calling your name)
I feel the skin dripping from my bones
Your touch, it makes me insane

I’m sailing high but I can't see
I’ve been pushed around, up and down in a cloud
And I can't breathe
I’m falling down, down to my knees
You've gotta let me go, you've gotta help me out
You've gotta set me free

You've gotta set me free
Yeah, you devoured my soul
‘Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It’s crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
‘Cause you can feel my pain

I can’t do this no more
You’re tearing me apart
So give me one last kiss
And then I have to let you know

You've gotta set me free
Yeah, you devoured my soul
‘Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It’s crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
‘Cause you can feel my pain

You're choking my neck, you might not let me go

It's all black
Your kingdom's turned me blank
I'm paper and I'm snow
I'm lost but I can't slow
I'm lost but not alone
It's so light
The dark it burns my eyes
My bones, they used to glow
But now I'm throwing stones
I'm losing where to go

Shadows on my back are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these horses will take flight
Falling hard, falling high, through your arms
Shadows in my head don't need no light
They stay through the night

Without you, my lips are turning blue
The water pulls me down
And drowns under your sound
This silence booms so loud
I'm locked up
Your kingdom's like a drug
The chains are made of glass
I'm breaking through your blood
I'm never strong enough

Shadows on my back are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these horses will take flight
Falling hard, falling high, through your arms
Shadows in my head don't need no light
They stay through the night

To every rose with bloody thorn
It lifts you up and lets you fall
To rivers flowing yond the factory halls
Your kingdom's come, it's waiting still
The space between you'll never fill
I tried but I could not change your mind

I dance around, and I lost you now
I breathed you out, I kept you out
But if I could, I'd turn back around

Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I promise I'll change, I'll do anything
Don't throw me away

People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
Photographs turn old and dusty
Roses rot, but memories never fade
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

I think about your heart
And how I broke it up
I always will regret
The secrets that I kept

Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I need you to stay
I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down
I'm broken and bent
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I promise I'll change, I'll do anything
Don't throw me away

People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
Photographs turn old and dusty
Roses rot, but memories never fade
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

Ah-ah-oh-oh
Ah-ah-oh-oh
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for
Ah-ah-oh-oh
Ah-ah-oh-oh
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

People come and people pass by
Like the seasons, life will always change
You are the one that I die for
You are the one that I die for

[Song 141: You’re the One]
34 ContributorsYou’re the One Lyrics
Dancing in the darkness
Pink and lilac, keep the silence
Crystals on the skyline
Cut the midnight, ultraviolet

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

Flying through the black night
You're the angel in the moonlight
Running through the thunder
Undercover, silver lover

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

Yeah, I'm dancing in the darkness
Three years before, I was feeling so heartless
But your burn shined through
Now I'm drinking love potion when I lay next to you
It's a criminal feeling
Happiness cries and my tears are dreaming
My body is screaming
I'm staying right here, no, I'll never be leaving

[Song 142: Black Roses]
34 ContributorsBlack Roses Lyrics
Purple and scarred
It's the color that will be on my heart, on my heart, on my heart
When you are done and dusted with me
I fall apart when I wash your touches off of my skin, of my skin, of my skin
I know you're tired of sticking to me

(Why am I) deep in black roses?
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses

You've got a diamond desire
Gonna step into the blue fire
Touching your lips with my skin
I'm on another level
I can't let go
Sat in the garden of sin
Like an angel with her dirty wings
Tainted by tastes of the soul
This is another level
I need to know

(Why am I) deep in black roses?
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses

You're turning me off (off), (Why am I)
Out of phase and into focus
You keep turning me on
You're turning me on
You're turning me off

Black roses go down, down, down
Black roses go down, down, down
Black roses go down, down, down
Black roses, black roses

Deep in black roses
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses, black roses

13 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisMiss U Lyrics
I love you
It's  obvious, but people can change
Yeah‚  we got bruised
We left things undecided
And now we're two people
We're  standing in the city rain
But  we're brand new
We turn our backs and walk away

Even  though we're through
I'm always here for you
I know you feel it too
I'm telling you the truth

Some  nights‚ I go back there
Right back where we used to love
Think I messed up somewhere
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know why I keep running
Don't know why I keep running

So far
I'm on the other side of the globe
With new friends
With someone else asleep in the sheets
But I got you‚ yeah
Locked up in a part of my brain
Forever, yeah
I can't forget my memories, no

Even though we're through
I'm always here for you
I know you feel it too
I'm telling you the truth

Some nights‚ I go back there
Right back where we used to love
Think I messed up somewhere
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know why I keep running
Don't know why I keep running

Sometimes, I miss you when I'm all alone
And even though we both moved on
Sometimes I play your favourite song
I play it on and on
And I, I miss you when I'm all alone
And even though we both moved on
Sometimes I play your favourite song
I play it on and on and on

Don't know what I keep running from (All I know‚ all I know)
Don't know what I keep running from (All I know, all I know)
Don't know why I keep running (I miss you)
Don't know what I keep running from (I miss you, I miss you, I miss you)
(I miss you, I miss you, I miss you)
Don't know what I keep running from (I miss you, I miss you, I miss you)
Don't know why I keep running (I miss you, I miss you, I miss you)
Don't know why I keep running

You had an ugly tattoo, and fucking cheap perfume
You couldn't dance, barely moved, I didn't know what to do
You had a friend in a band, but they're not that cool
You said you love me (okay let's rock)

Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hated your friends and your family too

You tried to drive me to France, we didn't get very far
You said forever but baby I'm not so sure

I feel electric rushes in my blood
Come on, it's plain for all the world to see
That you and me, we could be so picture perfect
You're the only one I want

I've been
Dreamin' of it
Ridin' in your car
Into the sunset

I can't get you out of my head
I just want you here in my bed
'Cause I really need you near me

Was it too much for you to handle?
Wish that I could hide it, but I can't pretend (No more)

It’s a midtempo song about being obsessed with a potential lover and wanting to love them forever.
It's a long way home, but I'm making my way
With so many things still left to say
I try to think about the one I mean the most
When my mind goes black
And then it hits me like a ton of bricks

I want you, not nothing else
I want to lock you up inside my heart

I always wanted you (I always will)
Sometimes it's hard (Sometimes it's hard)
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you (I wanted you)
From the start (From the start)
I want to lock you up inside my heart

Nothing says tomorrow is a guarantee
There's no way of knowing that you'll be with me
As I walk upon the edge of no escape
In a world so flat
And then it hits me like a bolt of faith

I love you, not nothing else
I want to lock you up inside my heart

I always wanted you (I always will)
Sometimes it's hard (Sometimes it's hard)
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you (I wanted you)
From the start (From the start)
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up

Please, don't leave, don't run
Why won't you stay in tonight?
Taste my lips, don't let go
I'm in your hand
I'm in your hand
I'm in your hand

Hey Charli, when you back from LA?
We gonna do another afterparty
We're just four bad girls from the UK
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah yeah

Somebody might know where you come from
Some other white girl might say London
We got Raye-sy and the Don Don

'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, the neighbours might complain
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna stay 'til mornin'
Then when the time is up, we'll do it all again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Pull up in my fresh whip, got Steffy on my left
We're stashin' that crown

Rent a black 'Rari, raising that trunk
I'm so in love with him, my god, it's just the life we livin'
Clap, bring on the encore
Let's pull up at the side, hop out of my ride
Cause we know we're up for one more

Somebody might know where you come from
Some other white girl might say London
We got Raye-sy and the Don Don

'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, the neighbours might complain
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna stay 'til mornin'
Then when the time is up, we'll do it all again

Seven, seven AM
And the house is still runnin'
When the sun is coming up
Glitter, glitter in my hair
And my shoes and my teeth
And I think I found the one
I can't stand up, walk straight, talk right
Can you pour me one more?
(Can you pour me one more?)
All my girls, pretty boys
We gon' go 'til we hit the floor
Then, after the afterparty
We're gonna keep it going
We're gonna rip it up
