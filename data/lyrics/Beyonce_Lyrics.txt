I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na-na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you (Ah)
We woke up in the kitchen, sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?", oh, baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin', if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right, Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway, then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this, swerve, surfin' all in this good-good (Ha-ha-ha)
We woke up in the kitchen, sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?", oh, baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love (I'm nice right now, hold up)

That D'USSÉ is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house, time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side, ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight
Catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae," said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae"
I'm nice
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight
We sex again in the mornin'
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in

We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing that's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin' watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule, I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't ever gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo, ooh

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule, I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo

Let me hear you say, "Hey, Ms. Carter" (Hey, Ms. Carter)
Say, "Hey, Ms. Carter" (Hey, Ms. Carter)
Give me somethin'

See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe

Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin', babe

Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say, "Speed it up," I just go slower
High like treble, pumpin' on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor

Beyoncé, Beyoncé?
Are you happy to be in Paris?
Are you happy to be in Paris?

Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seein' 'Yoncé on her knees
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara runnin', red lipstick smudged
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky'd all on my gown

Oh, there, daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like is right here with me

Driver, roll up the partition fast (Hey)
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blastin'
He like to call me "Peaches" when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we'll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdroppin', tryin' not to crash

Oh, there, daddy, daddy, now you rip my fur
Oh, baby, baby be sweatin' off my hair
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like is right here with me (Hello)

Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe, mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like is right here with me (Hello)

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

But you're just a boy

Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're takin' this a little too far
If we are, we're takin' this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're takin' this a little too far

Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should, what's up?

On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holdin' back on this and let's get carried away

Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine

All I'm really askin' for is you

Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine

One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should, what's up?

From eight until late, I think 'bout you
You own my nights, I don't know what to do, do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep, yeah
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm askin' for but you
Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don't go ghost on me, I'ma go "Thriller" on you

I miss feelin' on you (Pull up on you)
I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you, that's just how I feel about you (Pull up on you)
Been about you and I'm still about you, but
We ain't finished talkin' (Pull up on you)
I told you you don't need to worry 'bout them bitches
All them fives need to listen when a ten is talkin' (Pull up on you)
'Cause they don't wanna see you happier than them
And, girl, you swear they all your friends and that's been a problem (Pull up on you)
You the one they hate, this come with that (Yeah)
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a runnin' back
But that nigga came runnin' back (Pull up on you)
And you tell me you done with that
And I believe it's true
Long as you know who you belong to

What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, five-star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

What's up, what's up, what's up

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair

You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me (Pray you)
I'm praying you catch me

What are you doing, my love?

I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Seen your scars and kissed your crime

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
If you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

How I missed you, my love

The hip-hop-rappin' Girls' TYME!
Part I: "Bow Down"

I'm out that H-Town, comin', comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H-H-Town-Town, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches (Crown)
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down, bitches
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches (Crown)
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches (Crown)
H-Town vicious, H-H-Town vicious

I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H-H-Town-Town, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
Part II: ***Flawless
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-da-dee-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Riding 'round in it (Flawless), flossin' on that (Flawless)
This diamond (Flawless), my diamond (Flawless)
This rock (Flawless), my Roc (Flawless)
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
Say, "I look so good tonight"
Goddamn, goddamn
Say, "I look so good tonight"
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn

My mama taught me good home-trainin'
My daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man make me feel so goddamn fine, I'm flawless
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Riding 'round in it (Flawless), flossin' on that (Flawless)
This diamond (Flawless), my diamond (Flawless)
This rock (Flawless), my Roc (Flawless)
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
Say, "I look so good tonight" (Right, right, right, right)
Goddamn, goddamn
Say, "I look so good tonight" (Right, right, right, right)
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn

'Cause I need freedom, too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'ma keep running

I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord, forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth

Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Freedom, freedom, where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?

But I always find the inner strength to pull myself up
I was served lemons, but I made lemonade

Don't believe in nothin' but the Almighty

She never dream for ever be nobody wifey, yeah
She Wilhelmina pretty, but she heart is a maze
Play ya like a villain 'cause she caught in a wave
Tonight, I am walkin' away
Nine-to-five mind, on the grind, yeah, yeah

Tonight, I might fall in love
Dependin' on how you hold me
I'm glad that I'm calming down
Can't let no one come control me
Keep dancing and call it love

Melanin too dark to throw her shade (Shade)
She minds her business and wines her waist
Gold like 24K, okay

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screamin' out and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads

What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well, my aspiration in life would be
To be happy

Mama said, "You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters"

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, I'm gonna take the crown
Without fallin' down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South Beach, sugar-free
Vogue says thinner is better
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, I'm gonna take the crown
Without fallin' down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)

Pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's my soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst (Pretty hurts)
Perfection is a disease of a nation (Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something (Pretty hurts)
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

When you're alone all by yourself (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
And you're lyin' in your bed (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Reflection stares right into you (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
You stripped away the masquerade (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
The illusion has been shed (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Mm

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talkin' that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was puttin' you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin' in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me (Me)
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Mm
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me (Me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You must not know 'bout me (Baby, yeah)
You must not know 'bout me (Yeah)
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags, we're finished
(You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know 'bout me, me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away, oh
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe

Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that way

Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware

You're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad

But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now

I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston
And I've been driftin' off on knowledge
Catcalls on catwalks, man, these women gettin' solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder, "How come?"
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm lookin' off the edge, I preach my gut, it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbin' up the walls 'cause all the shit I hear is borin'
All the shit I do is borin', all these record labels borin'
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
All the people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive, how come?

Probably won't make no money off this, oh, well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm

It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm hauntin' you, you must be hauntin' me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be hauntin' me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me

You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You like it?
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm hauntin' you, you must be hauntin' me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm hauntin' you, you must be hauntin' me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be

Oh, my daddy said shoot

With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot

All up in the store, shorty, trickin' if I want to
All up in the store, shorty, fly as we want to
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Damn, I think I love that boy, do anything for that boy, boy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the flyest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it

All up in the back because the chicks keep flockin'
All that gossip in ten years, stop it
London, speed it up, Houston, rock it

Oh (Oh), killin' me softly (Ooh, woah)
And I'm still fallin' (Ooh, woah)
Still the one I need
I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone
Don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me, you out of your mind

My baby is a ten
We dressin' to the nine
He pick me up, we eight
Make me feel so lucky, seven
He kiss me in his six
We be makin' love in five
Still the one I do this four
I'm tryin' to make us three

I'm warnin’ you, don't come for my man (Jolene)
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Don't take the chance because you think you can

You’re beautiful, beyond compare
Takes more than beauty and seductive stares
To come between a family and a happy man
Jolene, I'm a woman too
Thе games you play are nothing new
So you don't want no hеat with me, Jolene
We've been deep in love for twenty years
I raised that man, I raised his kids
I know my man better than he knows himself (Yeah, what?)
I can easily understand
Why you're attracted to my man
But you don't want this smoke, so shoot your shot with someone else (You heard me)

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm warnin' you, woman, find you your own man
Jolene, I know I’m a queen, Jolene
I’m still a Creole banjee bitch from Louisiane (Don't try me)

There’s a thousand girls in every room
That act as desperate as you do
You a bird, go on and sing your tune, Jolene (What?)
I had to have this talk with you
'Cause I hate to have to act a fool
Your peace depends on how you move, Jolene
Me and my man crossed those valleys
Highs and lows and everything between
Good deeds roll in like tumblin' weeds
I sleep good, happy
'Cause you can’t dig up our planted seeds
I know my man's gon' stand by me, breathin' in my gentle breeze
I crossed those valleys
Highs and lows and everything between
Good deeds roll in like tumblin' weeds
Good and happy
'Cause you can't dig up them planted seeds
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'ma stand by her, she gon' stand by me, Jolene

I'ma stand by him, he gon' stand by me

So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink in this glass
Don't make me break it

I never broke one promise
And I know when you not honest
Now you got me yellin', that's because I'm jealous

If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine (Oh, I'm jealous)

Sometimes, I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never, ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this"

Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
Yoncé fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy, you been hangin' out at night, tonight, I'm stayin' out 'til tomorrow
Dancin' on them tables, ain't got no cares, no sorrows
I ran into my ex, said, "What up," to his besties
Now we reminiscin' how we used to flex in Texas, don't be jealous

If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine
Oh, I'm jealous

Sometimes, I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never, ever do

"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no, no, no"

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for makin' good love to each other
And I love makin' you jealous, but don't judge me
And I know that I'm bein' hateful, but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human
Don't judge me

I'm out that H-town
Coming, coming down
I'm coming down dripping candy on the ground
H, H-town, town, I'm coming down
Coming down dripping candy on the ground

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down, bitches

Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches
H-town vicious, H-H-town vicious
I'm so crown, bow bow down bitches

I'm out that H-town
Coming, coming down
I'm coming down dripping candy on the ground
H, H-town, town, I'm coming down
Coming down dripping candy on the ground


I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
'Cause I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

Rollin' high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what's good
Kiss my mama, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your boo was talkin' lip
I told my crew to smack that trick
Smack that trick, smack that trick
Guess what they did, smacked that trick
Gold everything, gold ass chain
Gold ass rings, gold ass fangs
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the number one chick, I don't need no hype
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life

I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
'Cause I been on

Ha-ha-ha-ha
I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids
Frenchy's, Boudin in the parking lot
Shout out to Willie D
I was in that Willie D video when I was about fourteen, lookin' crazy
Shout out Pimp C
You know we used to sneak and listen to that UGK
Didn't **** your girl but your sister was alright, damn
Ah-ah in ya homeboy's Caddy last night, man, ha-ha-ha-ha
Hol' up, Texas trill
H-Town goin' down, man

Your body laid out on these filthy floors
Your bloodstains on my custom coutures
Bathroom attendant let me right in
She was a big fan
I really tried to stay cool
But your arrogance disturbed my solitude
Now I ripped your dress and you're all black and blue
Look what you made me do
They keep sayin' that I ain't nothin' like my father
But I'm the furthest thing from choir boys and altars
If you cross me, I'm just like my father
I am colder than Titanic water

Help me, Lord, from these fantasies in my head
They ain't ever been safe ones
I don't fellowship with these fakе ones
So let's travel to whitе chapels and sing hymns
Hold rosaries, and sing in stained glass symphonies
Cleanse me, Holy Trinity
From this marijuana smoke smell in my hair

I sashayed my dress
Did my best impression of a damsel in distress
This alcohol and smell of regret
Allured my catch
Outfit too small to hide my scars
Feelin' bottled up like bottle service broads
How long can he hold his breath before his death?

Caro mio ben
Credimi almen
Senza di te
Languisce il cor
Il tuo fedel
Sospira ognor
Cessa, crudel
Tanto rigor
Ooh, ooh

Help me, Lord, from these fantasies in my head
They ain't ever been safe ones
I don't fellowship with these fake ones
So let's travel to white chapels and sing hymns
Hold rosaries, sing in stained glass symphonies
Cleanse me, Holy Trinity
From this marijuana smoke smell in my hair

Say I'm nothin' like my father
But I'm the furthest thing from choir boys and altars
Double cross me, I'm just like my father
I am colder than Titanic water

I know my enemy prey on me, so pray for me
Tick, tick, wait on it
I'm keepin' down my body count
I'm finessin' like a trap bounce, a trap bounce, yeah
'Cause every day above ground is a blessing
I done leveled up, now my view panoramic
None of my fears can go where I'm headed
Had to cut 'em loose, now I'm loose, break the levee, yeah
I'm 'bout to flood on 'em, flood on a sinner
The rain and thunder gon' pour
Go Mutombo, no, no sinner
You can't dim my light

'Cause when we walk up in the club
I need them sirens goin' off
Then we can look up in the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
It give me goosebumps every time
I threw up my diamond
Together, we big timin'
Don't make me have to remind you

I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
I promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever

Forever and ever
You heard that?
Forever and ever
That's the sound of the price goin' up

Forever, and ever-ever, and ever-ever (Yeah, yeah)
At the Saxon Madiba suite (Yeah, yeah) like Mandela
Bumpin' Fela on the Puma jet, like we from Lagos (My daughter)
Mansa Musa reincarnated, we on our levels (He 'bout business)
That's a billi', a thousand milli' (Ugh)
First one to see a B out these housing buildings
I be feelin' like Prince in '84 (Ow)
Mike in '79, Biggie in '97, '94 Nas
Ali bomaye, no kumbaya
Just give me the Sommelier (I got it), I'm on La Tâche
Helmet when I jet ski, you know the vibes
Hit my head, forget I'm me (I love it)
Oh my God, without the God in the XY (Yeah, yeah)
I'm afraid the whole game will be colonized (Yeah, yeah)
The marathon will be televised for N.I.P. (Aww yeah)​
'Cause true kings don't die, we multiply, peace

I'm so unbothered, I'm so unbothered
Y'all be so pressed while I'm raisin' daughters
Sons of empires, y'all make me chuckle
Stay in your struggle, crystal blue water
Piña colada-in', you stay Ramada Inn
My baby father, bloodline Rwanda
Why would you try me? Why would you bother?
I am Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter
I am the Nala, sister of Naruba
Oshun, Queen Sheba, I am the mother
Ankh on my gold chain, ice on my whole chain
I be like soul food, I am a whole mood

When we walk up in the club
I need the sirens goin' off
And when you look up to the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
I give 'em goosebumps every time
I throw up my diamond
Together, we big timin'

I got my cup up to the heavens

Ever, forever

Ever and ever and ever
Time to break it down now

All praise due
My enemies still pressed
Cannot lose
'Cause I bet on myself
I'm dancin'
Ancestors in my step
Now, I move better, ooh
Energy pourin' out
I feel a change comin' now
Royalty in my blood run the kingdom
The more money, more problems season
But don't you let that get you out your way
Rise up higher
Jump, jump and don't look down
You're so far from the ground
Yeah, yeah-eh-eh-eh

I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel

Promise this my mood forever

Now I be's the block
Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you
Hahaha

I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep 'em on a leash, though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sendin' me a drink ain't appeasin', believe me (Believe me)
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't no shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Takin' care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
And I'ma help you build up your account (That's a good look)
(Better yet, a hood look, ladies, that's a good look)
Believe me
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (That's a good look)
And anything you cop, I'll split the bill (That's a good look)

Switch your necktie to purple labels

Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade you, (I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you

I can do for you what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal
Still played my part and let you take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever you need me (You need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Takin' care of home and still fly (That's a good look)

It's big ballin', baby, when I'm courtin' you (Woo)
I'm talkin' spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on your finger's like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me, they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island-hoppin' off the Amalfi coast, mafioso
"Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?"
"No, not the car, but everywhere we are" (Uh)
You sure to see stars, this is high-level (Uh-uh)
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevatin' with me
Make you my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
But it's that little glimpse of light
That makes a diamond really shine
And you already is a star but, unless you flawless
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you (Woo)
Switch your necktie to purple labels

Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers, diamond-cream facials
VVS cufflinks, six-star pent suites
Partner, let me upgrade you, 'grade you

Let me, let me, let me upgrade you, 'grade you

Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight

At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to leave my home at an early age
I saw Mama prayin', I saw Daddy grind
All my tender problems, had to leave behind

It's been umpteen summers, and I'm not in my bed
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Goin' so hard, gotta choose myself
Undеrpaid and overwhelmed
I might cook, clеan, but still won't fold
Still workin' all my life, you know
Only God knows, only God knows
Only God knows

Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all the tears I fight

Sixteen dollars, workin' all day
Ain't got time to waste, I got art to make
I got love to create on this holy night
They won't dim my light, all these years I fight

It's been thirty-eight summers, and I'm not in my bed
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Goin' so hard, now I miss my kids
Overworked and overwhelmed
I might cook, clean, but still won't fold
Still workin' all my life, you know
Only God knows, only God knows
Only God knows

Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all these tears I fight

Oh, oh
Oh

At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to take care of home at an early age
I saw Mama cryin', I saw Daddy lyin'
Had to sacrifice and leave my fears behind
For legacy, if it's the last thing I do
You'll remember me 'cause we got somethin' to prove
In your memory, on the highway to truth
Still see our faces when you close your eyes

Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that, with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women

Me, myself and I

And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that, from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend

Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop callin' me, come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now, I am strong
Because I realized I've got

GRANDMOTHER (HATTIE): I was served lemons, but I made lemonade.
The crowd laughs and applauds. Cut to an upward view of trees.
BEYONCÉ (V.O.): My grandma said, nothing real can be threatened.
Pan down to the ocean, revealing the trees are growing directly out of the water. BEYONCÉ is in a white dress, standing atop one of the tree’s roots. Cut to a closeup of a woman. She is moving her hands and fingers in front of her face.
BEYONCÉ (V.O.): True love brought salvation back into me.
Cut back to BEYONCÉ, her back now against the tree.
BEYONCÉ (V.O.): With every tear came redemption.
Cut to BEYONCÉ and the woman tugging on either end of a rope, in a stalemate. Cut to a swathe of high grass. Fade to black.
BEYONCÉ (V.O.): And my torturer became my remedy.
Cut to an extreme closeup of BEYONCÉ. She is staring through the camera, then closes her eyes, then opens them again.
BEYONCÉ (singing V.O.): (I love...)
Cut to two woman in a garden. One is in the background, kneeling. The other is carrying a bucket full of vegetables. Cut to a rear view of the woman carrying the bucket of vegetables. The camera follows her as she walks out of the garden and into the yard.
BEYONCÉ (V.O.): So we're gonna heal, we're gonna start again. You've brought the orchestra.
Cut to a rear view of three women. Two are sitting, wearing yellow dresses. One is standing, wearing a red dress. The camera slowly zooms in on the one wearing a red dress.
BEYONCÉ (V.O.): Synchronized swimmers, you are the magician. Pull me back together again the way you cut me in half.
Cut to a closeup of a man and a woman, standing side by side.
BEYONCÉ (V.O.): Make the woman in doubt disappear.
Cut to BEYONCÉ and six other women, sitting on a porch stoop.
BEYONCÉ (V.O.): Pull the sorrow from between my legs like silk, knot after knot after knot.
Cut to a wide view of a sparse forest through which the setting sun can be seen.
BEYONCÉ (V.O.): The audience applauds...
Cut to black.
BEYONCÉ (V.O.): ...but we can't hear them.MUSIC CUE: "ALL NIGHT"Credits roll.MUSIC CUE: "FORMATION"

As we sip champagne, watchin' Purple Rain
Body’s insane, how could you complain?
Plus, I know you love my personality
I think I wanna go back to school, and have my locker full of pictures of you

Mmm, it’s something 'bout that look you give me

Mmm, it's something 'bout that feelin' you give me
I can't resist them butterflies
Mmm, you need a woman holdin' you down
Whenever, wherever, however, whatever, I’ll be right by your side

You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh

You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
You got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu, ooh

I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party

Ayy, ayy, ayy
(I don't know what y'all do, but we like to party, we like to party)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

Ayy, ayy, ayy

'Cause we like to party

Your touch is drivin' me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down, with the radio on and the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go

So in love, I don't care what they say
I don't care if they talkin' tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party

Set the scene, three thousand degrees
I ain't worried about them, **** **** over there, but they worry about me
I got a homeboy named Butter and another homeboy there, **** named Cheese
**** with me, baby, I'll make it milk 'til it drip down your knees
Spit this **** for real-o, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom and them, they never forgot and nothin' else really mean nothin' to me
I ain't studyin' the beat, talkin' to me?
Girl, why you **** with me? Move on, ain't nothin' to see
Sh, always somethin' to saw, I'm the raw, off the rip
'Cause of him, all of them, will remember the minute
They fell in love with rap, black like havin' your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due, cream like when I'm lovin' you, yeah

So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party

Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Song 58: Denial (Lemonade Poem, Part 2)]
16 ContributorsDenial (Lemonade Poem, Part 2) Lyrics
I tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, "Amen"
And said, "I mean"
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone and begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating?
Are you cheating on me?

Ooh, ooh
Oh, I know it ain't the same

I wish I could believe you, then I'll be alright
But now, everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin' you was easy once upon a time
But now, my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

Just can't seem to get over (Ooh)
The way you hurt me (Ooh)
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no (Mean a thing)
The very thing you gave to me (Ooh)
I thought I could forgive you (Ooh)
And I know you've changed (Ooh)
As much as I wanna trust you (Ooh)
I know it ain't the same (It ain't the same)
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time (Hard time, ooh)

I may never understand why (Why)
I'm doin' the best that I can, and I (Ooh)
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this, ooh)
But I'm much too full of resentment (Ooh, you lied)

I'll always remember feelin' (You lied)
Like I was no good (You lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you (You lied)
Like your mistress could (Ooh)
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever (You lied)
More than my own life (You lied)
But that part of me I gave you (You lied)
It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time (Time)
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (I can't go on and pretend like)
I tried and I tried to forget this (I tried and I tried and I tried)
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinkin', "What's up with B?"
I been cryin' for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin', can't stop cryin'
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes (You lied, you lied)
And see she's had half of me (You lied)
How could you lie? (You lied)

Now is the time to let love in (To let love in)
Together, can we stand?

Looka there, looka in my hand
The grandbaby of a moonshine man
Gadsden, Alabama
Got folk down in Galveston, rooted in Louisiana
Used to say I spoke too country
And the rejection came, said I wasn't country 'nough
Said I wouldn't saddle up, but
If that ain't country, tell me what is?
Plant my bare feet on solid ground for years
They don't, don't know how hard I had to fight for this
When I sang my song

(When I sang the song of Abraham)
(When the angels guide and take my hand)
(Oh, no)
Goodbye to what has been
A pretty house that we never settled in
A funeral for fair-weather friends
I am the one to cleanse me of my Father's sins
American Requiem
Them big ideas (Yeah) are buried here (Yeah)
Amen

Came out of nowhere, didn't give no warnin'
Pedal so heavy like the two most wanted
And I don't know what you're doin' tonight
But I

I'll be your shotgun rider
'Til the day I die
Smoke out the window flyin'
Down the 405
I'll be your backseat baby, drivin' you crazy
Anytime you like
Woah, I'll be your shotgun rider
'Til the day I, 'til the day I die

Making waves in the wind with my empty hand
My other hand on you
Been a while since I haven't tried to pull away
But it's time for something new

Came out of nowhere, didn't give no warnin'
Pedal so heavy like the two most wanted
And I don't know what you're doin' tonight
But I

I'll be your shotgun rider
'Til the day I die
Smoke out the window flyin'
Down the 405
Yeah, I'll be your backseat baby, drivin' you crazy
Anytime you like, woah
I'll be your shotgun rider
'Til the day I, 'til the day I die

('Til the day I, 'til the day I, 'til the day I die)
'Til the day I die
('Til the day I, 'til the day I, 'til the day I die)

I know we're jumpin' the gun and we're both still young
But one day, we won't be
I'll go wherever you take me, seems kinda crazy
Ooh, oh

I'll be your shotgun rider
'Til the day I die
We're gettin' high 'til we don't realize
Time is passin' by
Yeah, I'll be your backseat baby, I'm drivin' you crazy
Anytime you like, oh, oh
I'll be your shotgun rider
'Til the day I, 'til the day I die

('Til the day I, 'til the day I, 'til the day I die)
'Til the day I die
('Til the day I, 'til the day I, 'til the day I die)

Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
There, but for the grace of God, oh, I

I found Heaven on Earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

You are my Heaven on Earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria

Sometimes, love can come and pass you by
While you're busy makin' plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands
Baby, you got to understand

You are my Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first

Boy, you know they're lookin' for me, how we gonna hide it?
Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant
Every time I ride it, every time I ride this
I don't like to sit up in the saddle, boy, I got it
Just relax, I got this, I got that exotic
Hips are so hypnotic, I am such a tyrant

Send me some shots, are you with me or not? Throw it back
Shoot up the bar, then tell the law we don't remember nothin' after that
Scot-free (Scot-free), whole city after me
Have you seen her? 5'9'', thique and fine, what a tragedy
Hey, hey, ridin' you while we tryna get away
Ridin' you while we tryna catch a wave
That's so sexy and I know it, and I ain't afraid to show it
Baby, I'm goated, baby, I'm glowin'
Hey, hey, on the run, run
Tap me on the shoulder when you reload the gun

Tyrant every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Make it look so good, try to justify it
Boy, you know they're lookin' for me, how we gonna hide it?
Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant

How did you get used to the haunting? (The haunting)
The willing, the missing, the wanting (The wanting)
Dry eyes just send me across the divide
Hangman, teach me how not to cry
How not to cry, how not to cry

Oh, she got that woah there
Hangman got that woah there
Don't act like you don't know (Yeah)
Giddy up, giddy up (d.a. got that dope, hey!)
Don't pay me in gold
Giddy up, giddy up
Back outside, I'm on the road
Giddy up, giddy up (Hey)
When the sun goes down (When the suns goes down)
Giddy up, giddy up
You can hear this body howl (You can hear this body howl)
Giddy up now, diggadont, diggadont
Digga-daddy, can't leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone
Damn if I do, dammit if I don't
Lady with a whip, want what she wanna want, okay

Tyrant every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Make it look so good, cowboys justify it
Boy, you know they lookin' for me, how we gonna hide it?
Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Baby, I just don't sit up in the saddle, boy, I got it
Just relax, I got this, I got that exotic
These hips so hypnotic, I am such a tyrant

Hangman, answer me now
You owe me a debt, you stole him from me (Giddy up, giddy up)
I hated you once, I envy you now (Hey)
Just tell me how, tell me how
(Giddy up, giddy up)

Genres are a funny little concept, aren't they?
Yes, they are
That Beyoncé Virgo shit
In theory, they have a simple definition that's easy to understand
But in practice, well, some may feel confined
I swear 'fore God, it's 'bout to hit it
Jeeze, oh, ah
Woop
Right, right, ah, oh

I ain't in no gang, but I got shooters and I bang-bang (Goddamn)
At the snap of my fingers, I'm Thanos, da-na, da-na
And I'm still on your head, cornrows, da-na, da-na
They call me the captain, the catwalk assassin (Come on)
When they know it's slappin', then here come the yappin'
All of this snitchin', and all of this bitchin'
Just a fishin' expedition, dumb admission
In the kitchen, cookin' up them chickens
Extra leg, but I ain't even tryna kick it
Cunty, country, petty, petty, petty
All the same to me, Plain Jane, spaghetti
No sauce, no sauce (No), too soft, too soft (Uh)
They salty, they shootin', like Curry (One, two, three)
One hand on my holster, then pass it to Hova
Thought it was sweet when they was walkin'
In the backdoor of the kitchen past the dirty dishes
Now we on a mission, tried to turn me to the opposition
I'm appalled 'bout the proposition
Y'all been played by the plagiaristic, ain't gon' give no clout addiction my attention
I ain't no regular singer, now come get everythin' you came for

I ain't in no gang, but I got shooters and I bang-bang
(They still love your flame, ain't no game or I'll pierce your heart)
I ain't in no gang, but I got shooters and I bang-bang
(Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang)
Come get everythin' you came for

Ayy, howl to the moon (Howl to the moon)
Howl to the moon
Outlaws with me, they gon' shoot
Keep the code, break the rules (Break the rules)
We gon' ride for every member that we lose
Someone here brought fire, ain't no tellin' who (Oh)
Play it cool
Know the lawman watchin' me every time I move (Move)
Bounty on my head, can't go west, they on my shoes
No matter what the charges is, we ain't gon' tell the truth

I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
Oh-oh, and you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back to
You go back to

I, I love you much
It's not enough
I love blow and you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to black

Aw, baby, how you doin'?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made, but me, myself?
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
And, uh, what's more special than you?
You feel me?

It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up (Haha)

Usually I'm humble, right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know, I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs, matter of fact, it's my smile
Or maybe my eyes? Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda somethin' like me (Like me)

It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego (Ego)

But he loves my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up

It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)

I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch

See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
And every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe

Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin', babe

Drop the bass, mayne, the bass get lower
Radio say, "Speed it up," I just go slower
High like treble, pumpin' on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
'Cause when he want a smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes

Lost in a fairy tale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up, you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?

I said I miss you, missin' you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean 'em, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, why is that?

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missin' you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything
No matter who you love, it is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away (But you're away)
I said I miss you, missin' you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything
No matter who you love, it is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything

[Song 84: Roc]
18 ContributorsRoc Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh, oh I

If I wrote a book about where we stand
Then the title of my book would be "Life With Superman."
That's how you make me feel
I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same
I see it everyday in all the things you do
In all the things you say

You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock; I love to rock with you
You are my rock; you're everything I need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do
You are my rock; I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you

Oh, oh, oh I

If I were to try to count the ways to make me smile
I'd run out of fingers before I run out of time
Things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my loving strong
Make me wanna try my best to give you what you want
And what you need
Give you my whole heart
Not just a little piece
More than a minimum, I'm talking everything
More than a single wish I'm talking every dream

You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock; I love to rock with you
You are my rock; you're everything I need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do
You are my rock; I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you

If there's options, I don't want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you
I like us just fine
You're a rock in a sand, you're a smile in a cry
You're my joy through the pain
You're the truth through the lies
No matter what I do, I know that I can count on you

Oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh, oh I

You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock; I love to rock with you
You are my rock; you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do
You are my rock; I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you

Oh, oh, oh I, oh, oh, oh I

I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do
You are my rock; I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you

And when you grow, you take everyone you love along

And if I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

You call me pretty little thing
And I love to turn him on
Boy, I'll let you be my Levi's jeans
So you can hug that ass all day long
Come here, you sexy little thing
Snap a picture, bring it on
Oh, you wish you were my Levi's jeans
Way it's poppin' out your phone
Love you down to the bone

Baby, you play too much (You play too much)
Sendin' me super shots (Two shots)
I'm lookin' super hot (I'm hot)
I got the perfect pose (She snappin')
I'm a fuckin' animal (She sexy)
I'm a fuckin' centerfold (She ready)
Saddle up, I love to go (Saddle up, saddle up, saddle up, saddlе up)
Too tough, no primadonna
Possess too much persona
He said, "Whеre you get that from, uh?
You need to meet my mama
She'd be at church all day" (All day)
"Come be my Nick at Nite" (Night, night, night, night)
"So we can run it back" (Back, back, back, back)

And I let you touch it and you can't let it loose (Oh, oh)

And I ramble on, I could go on, but I'm goin' on silent (I'm goin' on silent)
So hop out the phone and bring that shit on, 'cause I'm goin' nosedive (I'm goin' nosedive)
And every time, you know just what to do (Mm)
No one ever got me going quite like you
Baby, let me rattle that snake with my venom
Denim on denim on denim on denim
Give you high fashion in a simple white tee
Give you these blues, it's in my genes
On my sister, on Celestine
God light shinin' through the in-between
Thigh gap saddle his leather seats

Come on, you pretty little thing
Girl, I wanna take you home
You know I'd like to be your Levi's jeans (I'll be your Levi's jeans)

48 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoEnglishFrançaisPortuguêsBIGGER Lyrics“Bigger” takes its themes from “balance (mufasa interlude)” which precedes it; like Mufasa, Beyoncé encourages her audience to see themselves as a crucial piece of a larger whole.
If you feel insignificant
You better think again
Better wake up because
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
Ah, you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you‚ bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret‚ no

Understand that truth about that question in your soul
Look up‚ don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh‚ take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'
No, I'm not just preachin'‚ I'm takin' my own advice

Let Mama let you know (Let you know)
Mama's still tryin'
I can't get no days off
I don't get no days off
Truly, I'm feelin' it
I had to say that thing twice (Twice)
Tryin' to be a good wife
Still really hard, I can't lie
But I promised you I would fight, so I fight
If you're feelin' frustrated and (Oh)
You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (Oh)
Forgiveness is key because
We're fightin' something way bigger
You'll never lose, we are winners
I'll be the roots, you'll be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah
We're part of something way bigger

(Yeah) Bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
Legacy, oh
You're part of something way bigger

Let love be the water
I pour into you and you pour into me
There ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary
You just don't know it yet
You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blood in ya
And you're gonna rise

You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than me
Bigger than the picture they paint us to be, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're part of something way bigger

Understand that truth about that question in your soul (Bigger)
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold (Bigger)
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print (Bigger)
Take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting, stand back

Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes, I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly, I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you (Ah)

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control (Ah)
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh

You know that I can't get over you

Baby girl, you should already know

One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one to one, nuttin' after me
No déjà vu, just me and my (Oh)

Baby, I can't go anywhere (Ah)
Without thinking that you're there (Ah)
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having déjà vu (Ah)
'Cause in my mind, I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care (Ah)
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having déjà vu? (Ah)

[Song 95: Broken-Hearted Girl]
40 ContributorsBroken-Hearted Girl Lyrics
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me, how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one

And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl

Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one

And yes, there are times when I hate you, but I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you, I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl

Broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl

Two hands to Heaven, my whiskey up high, oh (Oh)
God only, God only knows why, though (Oh, oh, oh)

In the Arizona heat, summer fling saw your best side
Slip into my dreams every night, be the good guy
Who am I to judge, my baby? (Uh-uh)

Purple-colored mink, sugarcane
Hittin' them sixteen switches
Candy apple green, candy paint
Swirling twenty-four inch spinners (Swirl)

Bottle in my hand, my whiskey up high

Two hands to Heaven I've prayed, priest forgive my soul
Lovely daggers pierced my heart many moons ago
Toxic roses chased by wolves and carnivores
Lost virgins with broken wings that will regrow

I'm a stallion runnin', no candle in the wind
You won't ever see me comin' or goin' but you'll know whenever I'm here
Dancin' in the moonlight, catchin' every breeze
My feet on the dashboard, now go really fast, boy
Ever since I went to Marfa, ain't no trouble on my mind (On my mind, on my mind)
Singin' sweet songs to Las Vegas, singin', "I will carry on"
Carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on
Singin', "I will carry on"

Ten thousand steps towards the time of your life
Two hands to Heaven, my whiskey up high, oh (Oh, oh)
God only, God only knows why, though (Why, though? Why?)
Rhinestones and diamonds both shine in the light
Two hands to Heaven, coyotes run wild, oh
God only, God only knows why, though (God only, God only knows why, though)

And it's over
If the sky falls fire
Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

If we wake up
Lose our patience
Or even lose our lives, oh
I'll feel lucky
To say that you've been
A friend of mine

Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

55 ContributorsTranslationsBeyoncé & Willie Jones - JUST FOR FUN (Русский перевод)TürkçePolskiNederlandsItalianoBahasa IndonesiaPortuguêsJUST FOR FUN Lyrics
I'm goin' all out just for fun, I am the man, I know it
And everywhere I go, they know my name
So I laugh and I lie and the coyotes cry
And, uh, time moves quickly and so do I, so do I
So I'll say my goodbye

'Cause time heals everything
I don't need anything
Hallelujah
I pray to her

Here's to hoping I'll fall fast asleep tonight
And I'll just need to get through this
Born in the darkness, who brings the light?
And I just, I need to get through this
Or just get used to it

I'm goin' down south just for fun, I am the man, I know it
And everywhere I go, I hide my face
From the cowboys in Clovis and the rodeo circus
I came here for a reason, but I don't know the purpose
It's all under the surface

But time heals everything
I don't need anything
Hallelujah
I pray to her

Here's to hoping I'll fall fast asleep tonight
And I'll just need to get through this
Born in the darkness, who brings the light?
And I just, I need to get through this
Or just get used to it

'Cause time heals everything
I don't need anything
Hallelujah
I pray to her
I pray to her

I didn't know about you then 'til I saw you with him again
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancin'
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong? Yeah

Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame (Hey)

One time, I took a swim in the Nile
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear
It made me relax when I came down
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now
Plunging away 'less my body's on top
All of these currents might cost me my life right now
When danger finds me, it follows with tides
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
She said

Hey little buddy, where you goin'?
I'm not sure, but I know I'm still in motion
This ain't regular, I seen regular
These streams may take me out to the ocean

Told myself if I dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket
Then I'll dive in it 'til I am exhausted and I'm type lacking
Waistline on four deep, senses on 4D
Feel like there's four me

One time, I took a swim in the Nile (One time, I took in a swim in the Nile; one time)
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear (I swear, I swear)
It made me relax when I came down (When I came down)

All of these currents might cost me my life right now (Right now, right now)
Where danger finds me, it follows with tides (Follows with tides; stimulated right now)
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
That's some good

Got the Nile runnin' through my body
Look at my natural, I'm so exotic
Darker the berry, sweeter the fruit
Deeper the wounded, deeper the roots
Nubian doused in brown, I'm lounging in it
Fountain of Youth, I said I'm drowning in it

I'm in the Nile, deep in denial
I'm in the Nile, deep in denial
That's some good

I don't wanna wake, wake

Excuse me? Um, I love you
Who starts a conversation like that? Nobody but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up or hide you
I'll get you out my mind, hmm, I try to
Why you? In my dreams, I knew
You knew how to be there, you knew how to treat it
You knew how to keep it, I wanna do more than touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you up to
We can leave right now, nigga, you don't need a duffle
La Perla, provocateur of secrets
How is it a secret if I know you're gonna peep it?
I see you peeking, don't wanna hear a peep
Wait

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
You're such a dream
If you can believe?
Boy you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah

Hey there, boy, I love you
I'm feeling like I know you, I can't help but wanna thug you
I'm watching all these broads trying so damn hard
But I can't even blame 'em 'cause you're so irresistible
I want to stand and yell, I won't ever dare to tell
I think I heard some wedding bells (keep that to yourself)
Is this real?
Ooh child, I can stop praying now
Past life, let's rewind
To the day when I met you
Throwback
Dear God, how could I forget you?
Your sex
Boy, it feels just like a dream to me
Now

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
You're such a dream
(You're such dream)
If you can believe?
Boy you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah

So to whom
It may concern
Please don't disturb me
Can't you see?
I'm happy, happily sleep, yeah

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up

Mama
I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

You used to dress and fix your hair
When you smiled through your tears
In the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and tryin', fightin', cryin'
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man, now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off (Woo)

Mama (You so sexy)
You live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(Uh, you a killer, you so sexy)

You used to dress and fix your hair
You always smiled through your tears
And in the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish this didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

And then you had enough and you took that ring off (Oh yeah)
You took that ring off (Oh yeah)
So tired of the lies and tryin', cryin', fightin'
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins (Oh yeah)
Dust yourself off and you love again (Oh yeah)
You found a new man, now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear, mama
After all them years
We can start all over again, mama
And now it all makes sense
Lettin' go is never the end, mama
We can love again
This is where freedom begins, mama

So put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody, put your love on top
Ayy, love on top
Ayy, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl, you so fine, put your love on top

If you're going through it, just know it's called "going through it," you're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die, you're gonna survive

If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight?
Would it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call?
Is there any hope at all?
Are you driftin' by?

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)

And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)

You were ready
What did I know? Starting our lives
Now my love, I'm ready to show

I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach you, I can almost feel you

I'm a trainwreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then, without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle, yes, indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I neglect you when I'm workin'
When I need attention, I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes, I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you


I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you, you, you, you

You, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you
You

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You're bad for me, I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss, you're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart-breakin' situation I'm up in, but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do (Ooh)
It's a catch-22 (Ooh)
'Cause the cure is found in you (Ooh)
I don't want it, but I do (Ooh)
You're just like poison (Ooh)
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie (Ooh, ooh)
Kiss me one more time before I die (Ooh)

You ain't right, take me high
Then that high, it subsides
And my body flat-lines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I'm alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

Baby, you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do (Ooh)
It's a catch-22 (Ooh)
'Cause the cure is found in you (Ooh)
I don't want it, but I do (Ooh)
You're just like poison (Ooh)
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie (Ooh, ooh)
Kiss me one more time before I die

It's just not my body (No)
It's my mind
You don't know how many times I told myself this can't do
And that I don't need you (No, I don't need you, no)
It's so unfair
That I find myself right back in your care
And what's good is that when you're not always there (There, there)
You're no good for my health, my health

You're just like poison (Woah, woah, woah)
You're just like poison (Woah, woah, woah)

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do (Ooh)
It's a catch-22 (Ooh)
'Cause the cure is found in you (Ooh)
I don't want it, but I do (Ooh)
You're just like poison (Ooh)
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie (Ooh, ooh)
Baby, kiss me one more time

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?

I'm not sure of what to do (Ooh)

I used to wake up somedays, and wish I'd stayed asleep (Why can't you get up?)
'Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today, the world's on top of me

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh-huh, uh-uh, uh

I said yes to your number and yes to you dating me
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me"
The first time I say "no" it's like I never said "yes"
(It's like I never said "yes")
I said, "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me"
But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say "no" it's like I never said "yes"
(It's like I never said "yes")

You was on the wall, I was with my crew
You was watchin' me, baby, I was watchin' you
Slowly, you walked over, I maintained my cool
You said hello to me, I said hello to you
You asked me where I'm from, I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me, I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you

I said yes to your number and yes to you dating me
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me"
The first time I say "no" it's like I never said "yes"
(It's like I never said "yes")
I said, "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me"
But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say "no" it's like I never said "yes"
(It's like I never said "yes")

Certainly, you can call me, baby
I love to hear from you
Yes, of course, you can come and see me, boy
Wanna get to know you more, sure, I'm feelin' you
"No, baby, not yet, we can't take that next step"
Why you getting so upset?
Boy, you act as though I never told you "yes" before
You are so ungrateful, mm-mm-mm

You was at my house, I was sittin' on my couch
You was really buggin', so I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you, you had a lot of nerve
You too damn old to be so immature, I hope you learn
You said I move too slow, I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later, I said, "Don't call no more"
It is cool if you can't wait for me, I'm glad you let me know
'Cause you showed me your true face, baby, the first time I said "no"

I said yes to your number and yes to you dating me (Yes)
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me" (Ooh, uh-uh)
The first time I say "no" it's like I never said "yes"
(It's like I never said "yes")
Ooh, I said, "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me"
But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say "no" (The very first time I say "no") it's like I never said "yes"
(It's like I never said "yes"; I never, never said "yes" before)

I said yes to your number and yes to you dating me

And keep talkin' that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that is on that Jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me

I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

So go ahead and get gone
And call up on that chick and see if she is home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Cause you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys hurry up before your taxi leaves

Not mine in the business, ugly self with a flat ass
I know that's your friend, but you first need a man
And regardless to what I do
I'ma stay on my grind and bust my heat, make sure there's food
When we can't stand the rain in the rolex now
And we feelin' like a shell jammed up in a barrel
All we gotta do is talk this out
Now you tell me who the man who got heart to step foot in this house
Girl, you must not know bout me
That shiny thang in the room gon' pluck a tree
And don't make this the reason I ain't touch you in eight days
I thought you was on your friend, thanks, he was leavin' you mad late
You pullin' out your hair, you scratch my face
Rip my rhyme book's, wildin', and you trashed the place
This is unjustifiable
I'ma do these dishes and wash my ass 'cause I ain't gotta lie to you
'Cause I ain't gotta lie to you
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Mm
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me (Me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You must not know 'bout me (Baby, yeah)
You must not know 'bout me (Yeah)
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags, we're finished
(You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know 'bout me, me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love, racing the Earth

And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

I wanna run, run
And smash into you
I wanna run, run
And smash into you

Ears closed
What I hear, no one else has to know
'Cause I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold

And I'm soaked in your love, ah
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh

I wanna run, run
Smash into you
I wanna run, run
Smash into you, smash into you

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Head (Head) down (Down)
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth

And I'm soaked in your love (Your love)
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

Oh, I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willin' to run (I wanna run, run)
Smash into you

I'm willin' to run, run, run, run, run
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm willin' to run, run, run, run, run
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

And I wanna run, run
And smash into you
I'm willin' to run, run

I feel weak, we've been here before
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through
But I honestly can say I still love you

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting 'bout the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over
Give love another life

I can see that we're not happy here
So why would we keep pretendin' when there's nothing there?
Maybe you like it, well, I don't
And maybe you'll settle, well, I won't

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting 'bout the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over
And give love another life

I know that this will hurt you, I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie
I feel I know that's the best for us

Let's start over
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over
I'm tired of fighting 'bout the same old thing
Let's start over, yeah, yeah
We both know that this love won't die
Maybe we can start all over
And give love another life

[Song 147: Can You Feel the Love Tonight]
14 ContributorsCan You Feel the Love Tonight Lyrics
I can see what's happening

I can't! What?

And they don't have a clue

Who's "they"?

They'll fall in love, and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two

Oh, I get it!

The sweet caress of twilight

Yeah!

There's magic everywhere

It's everywhere!

And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

Can you feel the love tonight? (Mamela thuli)
The peace the evening brings (Mamela thuli)
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things (Mamela lelando we)

So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me

He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside?

Can you feel the love tonight? (Mamela thuli)
The peace the evening brings (Mamela, mamela thuli)
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things (Mamela lelando we)
Can you feel the love tonight? (Mamela thuli)
You needn't look too far (Mamela thuli)
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed

His carefree days with us are history

In short, our pal is doomed

Baby thug, you know wrong from right
And you done felt wrong before
This can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know what you feel like, for instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos and the raggedy magazines
They have it **** badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my glide (Ooh)
Way I wear my hat to the side (Woo, woo)
The way I lean real low when I ride
That's why in my mind
They like my walk (My walk)
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back in a Porsche
But of course
But most of all, they like my honesty
Integrity, my loyalty
Young Hova and the letter B
