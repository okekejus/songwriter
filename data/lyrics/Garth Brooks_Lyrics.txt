Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

Every light is burnin' in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls
She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, "He won't do this again"
'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

[Song 2: Friends in Low Places]
15 ContributorsFriends in Low Places Lyrics
Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black-tie affair
The last one to know, the last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you, said, "Honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain"

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay
Yeah, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends
In low places

Well, I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's all right, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I'll be as high as that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay
Yeah, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends
In low places

I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
Yeah, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I got friends
In low places
Yeah, I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
Yeah, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I got friends
In low places
Yeah, I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay

[Song 3: The River]

You know a dream is like a river
Ever changin' as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores

And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

Too many times we stand aside
And let the waters slip away
Till what we put off till tomorrow
Has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance the tide

Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

And there's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll take some falls
But with the good Lord as my captain
I can make it through them all

Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
'Til the river runs dry

[Song 4: Ask Me How I Know]
9 ContributorsAsk Me How I Know Lyrics
You're stubborn as they come, you'll never settle down
You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around
You make all the rules, you're set in your ways
You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say I'm just another fool and this is just another song
But I know how you are, 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

And you best put this song on repeat
Maybe then you won't end up like me

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

[Song 5: If Tomorrow Never Comes]
18 ContributorsIf Tomorrow Never Comes Lyrics
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So, I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart?

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelin's for them never were revealed
So, I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

'Cause if tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

So, tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinkin' of
If tomorrow never comes

[Song 6: That Summer]
16 ContributorsThat Summer Lyrics
I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needin' somethin' from each other
Not knowin' yet what that might be

'Til she came to me one evenin'
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air, there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

That summer wind was all around me
Nothin' between us but the night
And when I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in each other's eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight, and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancin' with the wind
Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

Lookin' back on the memory of
The dance we shared, beneath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye

And now, I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance

Holding you, I held everything
For a moment, wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey, who's to say, you know I might have changed it all

And now, I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance

Yes, my life, it's better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance

A little baby told God, "Hey, I'm kinda scared
Don't really know if I wanna go down there
From here it looks like a little blue ball
But that's a great big place and I'm so small"

Why can't I just stay here with you?
Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too?
And God said, "Oh, child, of course I do
But there's somebody special waiting for you"

So, hush now, baby
Don't you cry
'Cause there's someone down there waiting
Whose only goal in life
Is making you sure you're always
Gonna be alright
A loving angel, tender tough and strong
It's almost time to go and meet your mom

You'll never have a better friend
Or a warmer touch to tuck you in
And she'll kiss your bruises, your bumps and scrapes
And anytime you hurt, her heart's gonna break

So, hush now, baby
Don't you cry
'Cause there's someone down there waiting
Whose only goal in life
Is making you sure you're always
Gonna be alright
A loving angel, tender tough and strong
It's almost time to go and meet your mom

Now when she’s talking to you
Make sure you listen close
Cause she's gonna teach everything
You'll ever need to know
Like how to mind your manners
To love and laugh and dream
And she'll put you on the path
That'll bring you back to me

So, hush now, baby
Don't you cry
'Cause there's someone down there waiting
Whose only goal in life
Is making you sure you're always
Gonna be alright
A loving angel, tender tough and strong
Come on child it's time to meet your mom

[Song 9: Unanswered Prayers]
9 ContributorsUnanswered Prayers Lyrics
Just the other night at a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them, the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if He'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
And just because He doesn't answer doesn't mean He don't care
'Cause some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me, in her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days, there wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what He's doin', after all

And as she walked away, well, I looked at my wife
And then and there I thanked the good Lord for the gifts in my life

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
And just because He may not answer doesn't mean He don't care
'Cause some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

[Song 10: Papa Loved Mama]
10 ContributorsPapa Loved Mama Lyrics“Papa Loved Mama” is a tragic love story between Papa and Mama, where jealousy and infidelity leads to murder.
Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy bein' a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the bein' alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
But when Daddy'd hang up she was gone again

Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good 'ne, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard, Papa's in the pen

Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for Mama up and down the hall
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town

Oh, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes and he was shiftin' gears

Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard, Papa's in the pen

People say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget
They say I need to get on with my life
But they don't realize

Is when you're dialin' six numbers just to hang up the phone
Drivin' 'cross town just to see if she's home
Wakin' a friend in the dead of the night
Just to hear him say it's gonna be alright
When you're findin' things to do not to fall asleep
Because you know she'll be there in your dreams
That's when she's
More than a memory

Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched her words go up in smoke
Tore all her pictures off the wall
That ain't helpin' me at all

'Cause when you're talkin' out loud but nobody's there
You look like hell and you just don't care
Drinkin' more than you ever drank
Sinkin' down lower than you ever sank
When you find yourself fallin' down upon your knees
Prayin' to God, beggin' him, please
That's when she's
More than a memory

She's more
She's more

'Cause when you're dialin' her number just to hang up the phone
Drivin' 'cross town just to see if she's home
Wakin' a friend in the dead of night
Just to hear him say it's gonna be alright
When you're findin' things to do not to fall asleep
'Cause you know she's waiting in your dreams
That's when she's more than a memory

People say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget

I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana
And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles, callin' Baton Rouge

A replay of last night's events roll through my mind
Except a scene or two, erased by sweet red wine
And I see a truck stop sign ahead so I change lanes
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change, callin' Baton Rouge

Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time

Hello, Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time
But until then I'll spend my money up, right down to my last dime
Callin' Baton Rouge

Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time

Callin' Baton Rouge
Sweet Baton Rouge
My Baton Rouge
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

His eyes are cold and restless
An' his wounds have almost healed
And she'd give half of Texas
Just to change the way he feels
She knows his love's in Tulsa
An' she knows he's gonna go
Well, it ain't no woman flesh and blood
It's that damned old rodeo

Well, it's bulls and blood, it's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

Well, she does her best to hold him
When his love comes to call
But his need for it controls him
And her back's against the wall
And it's "So long girl, I'll see you"
When it's time for him to go
You know the woman wants her cowboy
Like he wants his rodeo

Well, it's bulls and blood, it's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

It'll drive a cowboy crazy
It'll drive a man insane
And he'll sell off everything he owns
Just to pay to play the game
And a broken home and some broken bones
Is all he'll have to show
For all the years that he spent chasin'
This dream they call rodeo

Well, it's bulls and blood, it's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

It's the broncs and the blood, it's the steers and the mud
And they call the thing rodeo

6 ContributorsDive Bar Lyrics
Well turn that bottle up and drink it, crank that jukebox up and Hank it
Bartender, pour another round
Here's to our best bad decisions, situation, no conditions
Oh, and memories we all need to drown
So, fill your cup and raise it up
Jump in and join the club
And float this whiskey river reservoir
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

'Cause up in here you're not the only loved and left her
Lost and lonely one who's ever swam against the tide
Thinkin' this is your oasis, it's the safest of the places
That a broken heart can find to hide
So, here's a toast coast to coast
With a big old adios
To wishes wasted on them fallin' stars
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
For some barstool believers, wear our heart out on our sleevers
Just goin' where the neon glows


Yeah, it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
Yeah, we're just never quite belongers, hanger on-ers way too longers
Just buzzin' where the neon glows

Problems, we all got 'em
Let 'em sink down to the bottom
Doesn't matter who or where you are
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end
The water's fine, y'all, so just come on in
To the deep end of a dive bar
Of this dive bar
Talkin' 'bout a dive bar

12 ContributorsShameless LyricsGarth Brooks covered this song, originally written by Billy Joel and recorded on his 1989 album “Storm Front.”
Well, I'm shameless, when it comes to lovin' you
I'll do anything you want me to, I'll do anything at all
And I'm standin', here for all the world to see
Oh, baby, that's what's left of me, don't have very far to fall

You know, now, I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been livin' in
I don't break easy, I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied

I'm shameless, oh, honey I don't have a prayer
Every time I see you standin' there, I go down upon my knees
And I'm changin', swore I'd never compromise
Oh, but you convinced me otherwise, I'll do anything you please

You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down
I can walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you

I have never let anything have this much control over me
I worked too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly
But it's your world now, I can't refuse, I've never had so much to lose
Oh, I'm shameless


You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I've ever missed
But I've never been in love like this
It's out of my hands

I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
I don't want it anyhow, so I gotta let it go
Oh, I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be
You could make a total fool of me, I just wanted to you to know

Oh, I'm shameless
I just wanted you to know
Oh, I'm shameless
Oh, I'm down on my knees... shameless

I was feeling the blues, I was watchin' the news
When this fella came on the TV
He said I'm tellin' you that science has proved
That heartaches are healed by the sea
That got me goin', without even knowin'
I packed right up and drove down
Now I'm on a roll and I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town

So bring me two piña coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, and never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
She said goodbye to her good timin' man

Oh, now I've gotta say that the wind and the waves
And the moon winkin' down at me
Eases my mind, by leavin' behind
The heartaches that love often brings
Now I've got a smile that goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam
And I've gotta say that I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home

So bring me two piña coladas
I gotta have one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, we'll never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
She said goodbye to her good timin' man

Bring... bring... bring me two piña coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's all set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, and never leave dry land
Troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
And say hello to her good timin' man

Bring me two piña coladas
I gotta have one for each hand
Let's all set sail with Captain Morgan
And we will never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand...

11 ContributorsMuch Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old) Lyrics
This old highway's gettin' longer
It seems there is no end in sight
To sleep would be best
But I just can't afford to rest
I gotta ride in Denver tomorrow night

I called the house but no one answered
For the last two weeks no one's been home
I guess she's through with me
To tell the truth I just can't see
What's kept the woman holdin' on this long

And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's gettin' cold
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table, with no ace left in the hole
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old

The competition's gettin' younger
Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall
A worn out tape of Chris LeDoux
Lonely women and bad booze
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all

And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's gettin' cold
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table, with no ace left in the hole
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old

Lord, I'm much too young to feel this damn old

And we loved all the time
We're no good together
But it's sure as hell better
Than going forever
From whiskey to wine

When I talk, he listens
He don't show up missing
He's patient, polite and refined
He's handsome, romantic
But the problem is damn it
That after you it's like going
From whiskey to wine

Whiskey to wine
It's just not the same high
I miss the fire
The burning desire
We fought like we loved
And we loved all the time
We're no good together
But it's sure as hell better
Than going forever
From whiskey to wine
It's probably best, we rejoin the rest
And try to have what they call a good time
And hope it's not showing, we're walking in knowing
That we're going from whiskey to wine

12 ContributorsAin’t Going Down (’Til The Sun Comes Up) Lyrics
Six o'clock on Friday evenin'
Momma doesn't know she's leavin'
'Til she hears the screen door slammin'
Rubber squealin', gears a-jammin'
Local country station just a blarin' on the radio
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo
Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warnin'
Girl you better get your red head back in bed before the mornin'

Nine o'clock the show is endin'
But the fun is just beginnin'
She knows he's anticipatin'
But she's gonna keep him waitin'
Grab a bite to eat and then they're headin' to the honky-tonk
But loud crowds and line dancin' just ain't what they really want
Drive out to the boondocks and park down by the creek
Hey, where it's George Strait 'til real late, dancin' cheek to cheek

Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Goin' 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up

Ten 'til twelve is wine and dancin'
Midnight starts the hard romancin'
One o'clock that truck is rockin'
Two is comin', still no stoppin'
Break to check the clock at three
They're right on where they want to be
And four o'clock get up and goin'
Five o'clock that rooster's crowin'

Yeah, they ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Goin' 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up

Six o'clock on Saturday
Her folks don't know his on his way
The stalls are clean, the horses fed
They say she's grounded 'til she's dead
Well, here he comes around the bend
Slowin' down, she's jumpin' in
Hey, mom, you're daughter's gone
And there they go again, hey


Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Goin' 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up

[Song 20: The Beaches of Cheyenne]
13 ContributorsThe Beaches of Cheyenne LyricsA song that details a rodeo cowboy’s wife and her tragic end. She went crazy after her husband was killed while riding a bull in a rodeo in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
They packed up all his buckles
And shipped his saddle to his dad
And by the way the house looked
She must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday
To fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy
The night she got the call

Well, he was up in Wyoming
And drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn out
Well, it turned out that he lied
And all the dreams that they'd been livin'
In the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne

They she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks
The beaches of Cheyenne

They never found her body
Just her diary by the bed
It told about the fight they had
And the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin'
She said, "Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne"

They she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks
The beaches of Cheyenne

Nobody can explain it
Some say she's still alive
They've even claimed they've seen her
On the shoreline late at night
'Cause if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks
The beaches of Cheyenne

Yes, every night she walks
The beaches of Cheyenne

[Song 21: Belleau Wood]
5 ContributorsBelleau Wood Lyrics“Belleau Wood” was the 14th track from his 1997 album Sevens. The battle described in the song’s lyrics is not the Battle of Belleau Wood; it is instead a fictional account based on the Christmas truce… Read More 
Oh, the snowflakes fell in silence
Over Belleau Wood that night
For a Christmas truce had been declared
By both sides of the fight
As we lay there in our trenches
The silence broke in two
By a German soldier singing
A song that we all knew

Though I did not know the language
The song was "Silent Night"
Then I heard my buddy whisper
"All is calm and all is bright"
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me
Because I'd die if I was wrong
But I stood up in my trench
And I began to sing along

Then across the frozen battlefield
Another's voice joined in
Until one by one each man became
A singer of the hymn

Then I thought that I was dreaming
For right there in my sight
Stood the German soldier
'Neath the falling flakes of white
And he raised his hand and smiled at me
As if he seemed to say
"Here's hoping we both live to see us
Find a better way"

Then the devil's clock struck midnight
And the skies lit up again
And the battlefield where heaven stood
Was blown to hell again

But for just one fleeting moment
The answer seemed so clear
Heaven's not beyond the clouds
It's just beyond the fear
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds
It's for us, to find it, here

[Song 22: Standing Outside the Fire]
10 ContributorsStanding Outside the Fire Lyrics
We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk the tables being turned

We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always comes with getting burned

But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire

We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And for that forsake it all

They're so hell-bent on giving, walking a wire
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

There's this love that is burning, deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

[Song 23: We Shall Be Free]
12 ContributorsWe Shall Be Free Lyrics
This ain't comin' from no prophet
Just an ordinary man
When I close my eyes I see, the way this world shall be
When we all walk hand in hand

When the last child cries for a crust of bread
When the last man dies for just words that he said
When there's shelter over the poorest head
We shall be free

When the last thing we notice is the color of skin
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within
When the skies and the oceans are clean again
Then we shall be free

We shall be free
We shall be free
Stand straight, walk proud
'Cause we shall be free

When we're free to love anyone we choose
When this world's big enough for all different views
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew
Then we shall be free, yeah

We shall be free
We shall be free
Have a little faith, hold out
'Cause we shall be free

And when money talks for the very last time
And nobody walks a step behind
When there's only one race and that's mankind
Then we shall be free

We shall be free
We shall be free
Stand straight
Walk proud
Have a little faith
Hold out
'Cause we shall be free

We shall be free
We shall be free
Stand straight
Stand straight
Have a little faith
Walk proud
'Cause we shall be free

We shall be free
We shall be free
Stand straight, walk proud
'Cause we shall be free

[Song 24: All Day Long]
5 ContributorsAll Day Long Lyrics
Somebody's gotta start the weekend
Somebody's got to unwind
Somebody's gotta find that honky-tonk
Out on the county line
With pretty things and a band that swings
That gets 'em all out on the floor
And if we're gonna get the party started
Somebody's gotta swing them doors

Somebody's gotta feed that jukebox
Somebody's gotta drink that beer
Somebody's gotta get all rowdy
And raise some hell in here
Somebody's gotta dance with the women
Spin 'em to a country song
I can do this nightlife all day long

Somebody's gonna need a shoulder
When that sad song plays
Somebody's gonna need to hold her
Tell her it's okay
Just let her know to let it go
And then she's gonna have some fun
If she needs some help gettin' over him
Somebody's gotta get it done

Somebody's gotta shoot that whiskey
Somebody gotta bust that rack
Somebody's gotta play that country
That ain't ever comin' back
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm right where I belong
I can do this nightlife all day long


Somebody's gotta go the distance
Somebody's gotta call last round
Somebody's gotta turn the lights on
And shut this ol' bar down
When mornin' comes you'll find someone
With a headache and a grin
You know Saturday night is comin'
Somebody's gotta go again

Somebody's gotta feed that jukebox
Somebody's gotta hold my beer
Somebody's gotta get a little crazy
And raise some hell in here
Somebody's gotta spend that paycheck
'Til the money's gone
I can do this nightlife all day long

I can do this nightlife (Let me hear you say) all day long
(Yeah!)

[Song 25: Wild Horses]
8 ContributorsWild Horses Lyrics
From a phone booth in Cheyenne
I made a promise to Diane
No more rodeos
I'd gone my last go-'round
The same promise that I made
In San Antone and Santa Fe
But tonight I saddled up
And let her down

Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild, and her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away

She'll watch me drive around her block
Gettin' courage up to stop
To make her one more promise
That I can't keep
The way I love the rodeo
I guess I should let her go
Before I hurt her more
Than she loves me

Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild, and her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away

Wild horses keep draggin' me away
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday
Wild horses just stay wild, and her heart is all I break
Wild horses keep draggin' me away

9 ContributorsTo Make You Feel My Love LyricsThis cover of the song that Bob Dylan wrote for Billy Joel reached the top of Billboard’s Hot Country singles chart and received Grammy nominations for Best Male Country Vocal and Best Country Song.
When the rain's blowin' in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evenin' shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
It's no doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue
There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love


The storms are ragin' on the rollin' sea
Down on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowin' wild and free
But you ain't seen nothin' like me yet

There ain't nothin' that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
Make you happy, make your dreams come true
To make you feel my... love

10 ContributorsTwo of a Kind, Workin’ on a Full House Lyrics
Yeah, she's my lady luck, hey, I'm her wild card man
Together we're buildin' up a real hot hand
We live out in the country, hey, she's my little queen of the South
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

She wakes me every mornin' with a smile and a kiss
Her strong country lovin' is hard to resist
She's my easy lovin' woman, I'm her hard-workin' man, no doubt
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

Yeah, our pickup truck is her limousine
And her favorite dress is her faded blue jeans
She loves me tender when the goin' gets tough
Sometimes we fight just so we can make up

Lord, I need that little woman like the crops need the rain
She's my honeycomb and I'm her sugar cane
We really fit together, if you know what I'm talkin' about
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

This time I found a keeper, I made up my mind
Lord, the perfect combination is her heart and mine
The sky's the limit, no hill is too steep
We're playin' for fun, but we're playin' for keeps

So, draw the curtain, honey, turn the lights down low
We'll find some country music on the radio
I'm yours and you're mine, hey, that's what it's all about
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house

Lordy, mama, we'll be two of a kind, workin' on a full house

She's sun and rain, she's fire and ice, a little crazy but it's nice
And when she gets mad, you best leave her alone
'Cause she'll rage just like a river, then she'll beg you to forgive her
Oh, she's every woman that I've ever known

She's so New York and then L.A, and every town along the way
And she's every place that I've never been
She's makin' love on rainy nights, she's a stroll through Christmas lights
And she's everything I wanna do again

And it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
For when it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence


No, it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence

She's anything but typical, she's so unpredictable
Oh, but even at her worst she ain't that bad
She's as real as real can be and she's every fantasy
Lord, she's every lover that I've ever had
And she's every lover that I've never had

Loves her enough to walk away from you
I'd never cheat, an' I would never lie
In another's eyes, yeah yeah

In another's eyes, I can do no wrong
And he believes in me, and his faith is strong
I'd never fall or even compromise
In another's eyes, mmm

In another's eyes, I'm afraid that I can't see
This picture perfect portrait that they paint of me
They don't realize, and I pray they never do
'Cause every time I look I'm seein' you
In another's eyes

Whoa, in another's eyes, starin' back at me
I see a sinkin' soul tryin' desperately
To turn the tide, before it dies
In another's eyes, yeah yeah

And what they don't see, Lord, it's killin' me
It's a blessing and a curse that love is blind

In another's eyes, I'm afraid that I can't see
This picture perfect portrait that they paint of me
They don't realize, and I pray to God they never do
'Cause every time I look I'm seein' you
In another's eyes

2 ContributorsWhat I’m Thankful For (The Thanksgiving Song) Lyrics
What I'm thankful for ain't on no list
For it only in my heart exists
For time has helped me understand
The things I can't hold in my hand

For those that came before my turn
Oh, from whom I've gathered lessons learned
That light the path that lies ahead
I see them as I bow my head

Yes, I'm thankful for the Lord above
The gift of His unending love
The promise kept that there is something more
These are the things I'm thankful for

For our children hear this prayer
Let love surround them everywhere
And may their children's children know
The one from whom all blessings flow

Yes, I'm thankful for the Lord above
The gift of His unending love
The promise kept that there is something more
These are the things I'm thankful for

And amidst these gifts and presents
We receive this holiday
May we take a thoughtful second
Just to fold our hands and pray

Yes, I'm thankful for the Lord above
The gift of His unending love
The promise kept that there is something more
These are the things I'm thankful for

2 ContributorsEvery Now and Then Lyrics
I walked down to the park last night
Warm breeze stirrin' up a soft moonlight
And my mind started driftin' to way back when
Yes, I do think about you every now and then

The other day I saw a car like you used to drive
I got a funny feelin' down deep inside
And for the briefest moment, I felt a smile begin
Yes, I do think about you, every now and then

And I love my life and I'd never trade
Between what you and me had and the life I've made
'Cause she's here and she's real, but you were too
And every once in a while I think about you

I heard a song on the radio just yesterday
The same one you always asked me to play
And when the song was over I wished they'd played it again
Yes, I do think about you every now and then

And I love my life and I'd never trade
Between what you and me had and the life I've made
'Cause she's here and she's real, but you were too
And every once in a while I think about you

I've been layin' here all night listenin' to the rain
Talkin' to my heart, tryin' to explain
Why sometimes I catch myself wondering what might have been
Yes, I do think about you every now and then

Every now and then

[Song 32: In Lonesome Dove]
2 ContributorsIn Lonesome Dove Lyrics
She was a girl on a wagon train
Headed west across the plains
The train got lost in a summer storm
They couldn't move west and they couldn't go home
Then she saw him ridin' through the rain
He took charge of the wagons and he saved the train
And she looked down and her heart was gone
The train went west but she stayed on
In Lonesome Dove

A farmer's daughter with a gentle hand
A blooming rose in a bed of sand
She loved the man who wore a star
A Texas Ranger known near and far
So they got married and they had a child
But times were tough and the west was wild
So it was no surprise the day she learned
That her Texas man would not return
To Lonesome Dove

Back to back with the Rio Grande
A Christian woman in the devil's land
She learned the language and she learned to fight
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights

In Lonesome Dove
Lonesome Dove

She watched her boy grow into a man
He had an angel's heart and the devil's hand
He wore his star for all to see
He was a Texas lawman legacy
The one day word blew into town
It seemed the men that shot his father down
Had robbed a bank in Cherico
The only thing 'tween them and Mexico
Was Lonesome Dove

The shadows stretched across the land
As the shots rang out down the Rio Grande
And when the smoke had finally cleared the street
The men lay at the ranger's feet
But legend tells to this very day (Legend tells to this very day)
That shots were comin' from an alleyway
Though no one knows who held the gun
There ain't no doubt if you ask someone
In Lonesome Dove

Back to back with the Rio Grande
A Christian woman in the devil's land
She learned the language and she learned to fight
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights

In Lonesome Dove
Lonesome Dove

[Song 33: Ireland]
5 ContributorsIreland Lyrics
They say mother earth is breathing
With each wave that finds the shore
Her soul rises in the evening
For to open twilight's door
Her eyes are the stars in heaven
Watching o'er us all the while
And her heart it is in Ireland
Deep within the Emerald Isle

We are forty against hundreds
In someone else's bloody war
We know not why we're fighting
Or what we're dying for
They will storm us in the morning
When the sunlight turns the sky
Death is waiting for its dance now
Fate has sentenced us to die

Ireland, I am coming home
I can see your rolling fields of green and fences made of stone
I am reaching out, won't you take my hand
I'm coming home, Ireland

Oh, the captain he lay bleeding
And I can hear him callin' me
These men are yours now for the leading
Show them to their destiny
And as I look up all around me
I see the ragged, tired, and torn
I tell them to make ready
'Cause we're not waiting for the morn'

Ireland, I am coming home
I can see your rolling fields of green and fences made of stone
I am reaching out, won't you take my hand
I'm coming home, Ireland

Now the fog is deep and heavy
As we forge the dark and fear
We can hear their horses breathing
As in silence, we draw near
And there are no words to be spoken
Just a look to say goodbye
I draw a breath and night is broken
As I scream our battle cry

Ireland, I am coming home
I can see your rolling fields of green and fences made of stone
I am reaching out, won't you take my hand
I'm coming home, Ireland
Yes, I am home, Ireland

We were forty against hundreds

Last time I saw her it was turnin' colder
But that was years ago
Last I heard she had moved to Boulder
But where she's now I don't know
But there's somethin' 'bout this time of year
That spins my head around
Takes me back and makes me wonder
What's she doin' now?

'Cause what she's doin' now is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind and emptyin' my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows, what she's doin' now

Just for laughs, I dialed her old number
But no one knew her name
Hung up the phone, sat there and wondered
If she'd ever done the same
I took a walk in the evenin' wind
To clear my head somehow
But tonight, I lie here thinkin'
What's she doin' now?

'Cause what she's doin' now, is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind, and emptyin' my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows...

That what she’s doin' now, is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind, and emptyin' my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows, what she’s doin' now

3 ContributorsSomewhere Other Than the Night Lyrics
He could see the storm clouds rollin' across the hill
He barely beat the rain in from the field
And between the backdoor slammin' she heard him say
"Damn this rain and damn this wasted day"

But she'd been waitin' for this day for oh-so-long
She was standin' in the kitchen with nothin' but her apron on
And in disbelief he stood and he stared a while
But when their eyes met, they both began to smile

Somewhere other than the night
She needs to hear I love you
Somewhere other than the night
She needs to know you care
And she wants to know she's needed
And she needs to be held tight
Somewhere other than the night

They spent the day wrapped up in a blanket on the front porch swing
He'd come to realize he'd neglected certain things
And there are times she feels alone even by his side
It was the first time, she ever saw him cry

Somewhere other than the night
She needs to hear I love you
Somewhere other than the night
She needs to know you care
And she wants to know she's needed
And she needs to be held tight
Somewhere other than the night

To know she's needed
She needs to be held tight
Somewhere other than the night

4 ContributorsBeer Run Lyrics
Twenty-five minutes past quitting time
Seven of us crammed into that truck of mine
Paying no attention to them highway signs
Doing ninety miles an hour toward the county line
Quick sack, twelve pack, back agian
It's a B double - E double - R U N
My buddies and their babies letting down their hair
As long as we're together it don't matter where
Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care
Knowing half the fun is getting there
Aztec, long-necks, paychecks spent
Oh, it's a B double - E double - R U N
I can't stop thinking
What the hell they were drinking
When they made this county dry
I got a week long thrist
And to make it worse
Lord, it's my turn to drive
Laughing and a bragging and a carrying on
We loaded up the wagons and we headed home
I guess a half a dozen cases doesn't last that long
Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone
Then, it's turn around, leave town, sounds agian
Like a B double - E double - R U N

Downtown at an office party Christmas Eve
Shaking everybody's hand so I could leave
About to say, "I'd love to stay, but..." that was when
That pretty little girl from accounting walked in

Ho, Ho, Ho, there's really nothing better
Than a beautiful girl in an ugly Christmas sweater
Ho, Ho, Ho, and now I can't forget her
That beautiful girl in an ugly Christmas sweater

So, I made my way across the room so she might be
Happily accidentally standing next to me
I grabbed her hand and asked the band to make it swing
The boys jumped up and they started to sing

Ho, Ho, Ho, there's really nothing better
Than a beautiful girl in an ugly Christmas sweater
Ho, Ho, Ho, and now I can't forget her
That beautiful girl in an ugly Christmas sweater

Then the lights came way down low
When the band played something slow
And the next thing that you know
We were underneath the mistletoe

Singing Ho, Ho, Ho, and now we are together
That beautiful girl in an ugly Christmas sweater
Ho, Ho, Ho, and boys there's nothing better
Than a beautiful girl in an ugly Christmas sweater
A beautiful girl in an ugly Christmas Sweater

[Song 38: The Gift]
4 ContributorsThe Gift Lyrics
A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for to rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay

A few moments passed 'til she saw it
For its feathers were covered with sand
But soon, clean and wrapped, it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the town folks brought presents
To lay by the manger that night

There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited 'til just before midnight
So no one would see her go in
And crying, she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
"Maria, what brings you to me?"
"If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see"

Though she trembled, she did as He asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring up into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song

[Song 39: When You Come Back to Me Again]
5 ContributorsWhen You Come Back to Me Again Lyrics
There's a ship out on the ocean
At the mercy of the sea
It's been tossed about, lost and broken
Wandering aimlessly
And God somehow you know that ship
Is me

'Cause there's a lighthouse, in a harbor
Shining faithfully
Pouring its light out, across the water
For this sinking soul to see
That someone out there still believes
In me

On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on, on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end
When you come back to me again

There's a moment, that we all come to
In our own time, and our own space
Where all that we've done, we can undo
If our heart's in the right place

On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on, on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end
And you come back to me again

And again I see, my yesterday's in front of me
Unfolding like a mystery, you're changin' all that is and used to be

On a prayer, in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hangin' on
Rainin' down, against the wind
I'm reachin' out, 'til we reach the circle's end
When you come back to me again
When you come back to me again

[Song 40: That Ol’ Wind]
2 ContributorsThat Ol’ Wind Lyrics
She dropped her boy at school on time, one less worry on her mind
Now it's off to work and on the radio
Comes an old familiar song and then the D.J.'s voice comes on
And say's he's back in town tonight for one last show

Her eyes well up with tears, God, could it be it's been ten years
Since that autumn night outside the county fair
When two strangers shared a night and in the darkness found a light
That to this day is still alive and burning there

And he asked her twice to come along
And they said goodbye at the break of dawn
'Cause you can't hold back the wind, and if it's meant to be again
Then someday he'll find his way back to her arms

The marquee misspelled his name and not too many people came
But that didn't matter to them
They laughed and loved all through the night and as they faced the morning light
They found themselves standing there again

And he asked her twice to come along
And they said goodbye at the break of dawn
And as his bus left out she cried, with him standing by her side
That old wind had once again found its way home

And someday he'll tell her about the money he hid
And someday she'll tell him that the boy is his kid
But for right now they are both in love, the only thing they are thinking of
Is that they're finally where their hearts have always, been

[Song 41: The Night I Called the Old Man Out]
6 ContributorsThe Night I Called the Old Man Out LyricsA fight between a father and son turns physical, and the father proves his physical strength, but his even larger heart.
The dining room fell silent, I can't believe what I just said
I just told my dad he's full of it and I watched his face turn red
Well, and I should've said, "I'm sorry", but I matched him shout for shout
An' I can still hear that screen door slammin', the night I called him out

And he said, "Son, it's gonna hurt me, more than it hurts you"
But somehow I couldn't help but have my doubts
'Cause I'd seen my older brothers crawl back in the house
Each time they called the old man out

Fist to fist and eye to eye, standin' toe to toe
He would've let me walk away, but I just would not let it go
Years of my frustration had led me to this night
Now he'll pay for all the times that he's been right

And he said, "Son, it's gonna hurt me, more than it hurts you"
But somehow I couldn't help but have my doubts
'Cause I'd seen my older brothers crawl back in the house
Each time they called the old man out

It was over in a minute and that's when I realized
The blood came from my mouth and nose, but the tears came from his eyes
And in memory of that fateful night, I know the greatest pain was his
And I just pray someday I'm half the man he is

And he said, "Son, it's gonna hurt me, more than it hurts you"
But somehow I couldn't help but have my doubts
'Cause I'd seen my older brothers crawl back in the house
Each time they called the old man out

Just like my older brothers, I crawled back in the house
The night I called the old man out

[Song 42: She’s Gonna Make It]
3 ContributorsShe’s Gonna Make It Lyrics
He followed her to work this mornin
He'd never seen that dress before
And she seemed to sail right through those dark clouds forming
That he knows he's headed for
After seven years of marriage
He wanted out
Now after seven months of freedom
It's clear that there's no doubt

She's gonna make it and he never will
He's at the foot of the mountain, she's over that hill
He's sinkin' at sea and her sails are filled
She's gonna make it and he never will

No, It's not like she's forgot about him
She's just dealin' with the pain
And the fact that she's survived so well without him
You know it's drivin' him insane
And the crazy thing about it
Is she'd take him back
But the fool in him that walked out
Is the fool that just won't ask

She's gonna make it and he never will
He's at the foot of the mountain, she's over that hill
He's sinkin' at sea and her sails are filled
She's gonna make it and he never will

Lord, she's gonna make it, he never will

[Song 43: That Girl Is A Cowboy]
2 ContributorsThat Girl Is A Cowboy Lyrics
It was a hundred and seven
We were heading to town
She had her sleeves rolled up
And the windows rolled down
That girl is a cowboy
Robert Earl was singing out
The "Buckin' Song"
With every word that Keen was bringing
She was singing along
That girl is a cowboy

Sometimes the best cowboys aren't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
Because sometimes the best cowboys
Aren't cowboys at all

So I took her tout to show her
How to rope and ride
I can't believe that it was me
That wound up broke and tied
The girls is a cowboy
So that night I decided
We should paint the town
I made it home although
I really don't remember how
That girl is a cowboy

Sometimes the best cowboys aren't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
Because sometimes the best cowboys
Aren't cowboys at all

There's just something that a cowgirl has
Aren't no cowboy's got
Man she's something when she's one of the boys
But something else
Any time she's not

Sometimes the best cowboys aren't cowboys at all
She's got my back
Even when it's against the wall
When I need a friend
She's the guy I call
Because sometimes the best cowboys
Aren't cowboys at all

There's no more waiting, holding out for love
You are my Godsend that I have been forever dreaming of
My angel from above
Heaven knows, I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field, I suppose
But there's something about you when you're around
Baby, I have found, I get lost in you
What is this feeling I've never known before?
That I should dare to, swear into, surrender ever more
That's what I came here for

Heaven knows, I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field, I suppose
But there's something about you when you're around
Baby, I have found, I get lost in a wonderful daze
Lost in your wonderful ways, Heaven knows
When you're around, baby, I have found I get lost

4 ContributorsRodeo Man Lyrics
All broke down and banged up
Been laid up a couple weeks
Had my share of bad lucks
Hard falls and drawin' deep

I'll be back in no time, ladies
I gotta make Fort Worth
I'm one buckle shy of Vegas
Or pawn shop hockin' these spurs

Pull up them boots, ease me down in that chute
Tie me on tight, bet it all on one good ride
Get me off this thing alive, get me eight, Lord, that's the plan
It's just a day in the life of a rodeo man

Cold water truck stop showers
Been rode hard and put up wet
Yeah, four more uphill hours
To show 'em that I ain't dead yet

Pull up thеm boots, ease me down in that chutе
Tie me on tight, bet it all on one good ride
Get me off this thing alive, get me eight, Lord, that's the plan
It's just a day in the life of a rodeo man

Hooked hard on the habit
Livin' for one good ride
Like a fox on the tail of a rabbit
I'm chasin' that buckaroo life

Pull up them boots, ease me down in that chute
Tie me on tight, bet it all on one good ride
Get me off this thing alive, get me eight, Lord, that's the plan
It's just a day in the life of a rodeo man

It's just a day in the life of a rodeo man

4 ContributorsThe Red Strokes Lyrics
Moonlight on canvas, midnight and wine
Two shadows starting to softly combine
The picture they're painting is one of the heart
And to those who have seen it, it's a true work of art

Oh, the red strokes, passions uncaged
Thundering moments of tenderness rage
Whoa, the red strokes, tempered and strong
Burning the night like the dawn

Steam on the window, salt in a kiss
Two hearts have never pounded like this
Inspired by a vision, that they can't command
Erasing the borders, with each brush of a hand

Oh, the red strokes, passions uncaged
Thundering moments of tenderness rage
Whoa, the red strokes, tempered and strong
Burning the night like the dawn

Oh, the blues will be blue and the jealousies green
But when love picks its shade, it demands to be seen

Oh, the red strokes, passions uncaged
Thundering moments of tenderness rage
Whoa, the red strokes, fearlessly drawn
Burning the night like the dawn

Oh, the red strokes, passions uncaged
Thundering moments of tenderness rage
Whoah, the red strokes, fearlessly drawn
Burning the night like the dawn

Steam on the window, salt in a kiss
Two hearts have never, pounded like this

From the hills to Kaycee, Wyoming
Where life's wooly and wild
Came an Air Force brat
In a cowboy hat
And that Copenhagen smile
And from bucking broncs
To honky tonks
He always sang a cowboy's song
We were much too young
Having too much fun
As we all sang along

(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

From gold buckles to gold records
Well, once again he was spinning 'round
Took the whole world on
And he turned us on
To that Western Underground
And from "Bareback Jack"
To "This Cowboy's Hat"
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down
From town to town
Like children running through the rain

(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

I bet he crossed that river Jordan
With St. Peter on the other side
Singing good ride cowboy, good ride
Good ride cowboy, good ride

[Song 48: All American Kid]
9 ContributorsAll American Kid Lyrics
Was the captain of the team his senior year
In his eyes on his helmet he had no fear
Down by a six ball on the ten
Said huddle up boys we’ve got a game to win

Snapped the ball, he looked left and right
Nobody was open so he tucked in tight
And with four of them boys hanging on to him
The clock ran out as he ran it in

And the whole town cheers
And his mama cried
And they rushed down field
And they raised him high
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read All American Hometown Kid

He was recruited by the best schools in the land
He decided he’d sign with his Uncle Sam
He kissed mama goodbye in their living room
Said dad don’t worry I’ll be home soon

And the whole town cheers
And his mama cried
And they lined the street
Just to say goodbye
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read Come Back All American Hometown Kid


Three tours of duty and a silver star
Brought him back home with his battle scars
He stepped off the plane in his combat boots
He saluted the red white and blue

And the whole town cheered
And his mama cried
Another hometown boy made it home alive
Got his picture in the paper and the headline read Welcome Back Home All American Kid
Yeah, this song is for those who never did come back all American kids

[Song 49: Everytime That it Rains]
2 ContributorsEverytime That it Rains Lyrics
Stuck in an airport in Austin
All of the flights are delayed
And as the rains keeps fallin' the memories keep callin' me back
To another time and place
Back to a rainy day in Oklahoma
She was workin' at this roadside cafe
And it was just her and me, and looked like it would be
At least 'til the storms rolled away

I played "Please Come to Boston" on the jukebox
She said, "Hey, that's my favorite song"
The next thing I knew, the song was long through
And we were still dancin' along
And with that look in her eyes she pulled from me
Then she pulled off that apron she wore
And with her hand in mine we turned off the sign
And locked the rain outside the door

Every time that it rains, I can hear her heart callin'
It rains, I can see that dress fallin'
The storm clouds roll on, still the memory remains
Every time that it rains

One late rainy night I got a phone call
So I went back to see her again
And through the dance we both stumbled and with the buttons we fumbled
So, we decided just to call it at friends
If we ever had a thing now it's over
And only the memory remains
Of a roadside cafe on a September day
I relive every time that it rains

Every time that it rains, I can hear her heart callin'
It rains, I can see that dress fallin'
The storm clouds roll on, still the memory remains
Every time that it rains

Every time that it rains
Every time that it rains
It's rainin' on me
Every time, every time

[Song 50: The Cowboy Song]
4 ContributorsThe Cowboy Song Lyrics
Pushin' horns weren't easy like the movie said it was
And I don't recall no dance hall girls or hotel rooms with rugs
You worked hot and tired and nasty, rode your pony's head too low
There were all the nights you couldn't sleep 'cause it was too damn cold
And you'd sing "Strawberry Roan" and "Little Joe"

Like the time we hit the river and the rains began to fall
And the water was risin' so damn fast we thought it'd drown us all
We lost a lot of steers that day and four to five good mounts
But when all the boys rode into camp, we knew that's what counts
And we sang, yippee ti yi yay and "Amazing Grace"

Or the night they broke behind us and then took us by surprise
I whistled out to Bonner I seen the terror in his eyes
And he rode for all his horse would ride and I know he done his best
But he crossed over Jordan ridin' Donny to his death
And we sang "Bringing in the Sheaves" and "The Rugged Cross"

So when you see the cowboy, he's not ragged by his choice
He never meant to bow them legs or put that gravel in his voice
He's just chasin' what he really loves and what's burnin' in his soul
Wishin' to God that he'd been born a hundred years ago
Still singin', "Strawberry Roan" and "Little Joe"

2 Contributors8teen LyricsWe took Ventura Highway to the Sunshine State
Where they raised their hands to Jesus as they passed the plate
Oh, and every day we spent there was Valentine's day
There's a new team, out in Queens, 8teen
And the girl made in Japan was made for me to hold
When Vincent lent an ear the night the thunder rolled
And the ride we took together was a rodeo
Big dreams, six strings, 8teen
And for everyone born 8teen runnin' wild and free
From the pearly gates of Heaven to the fiery sea
Know that each will teach of passage through the trinity
God's gift runneth 'ore my cup
Call it a blessing or you call it luck
It all adds up to 8teen
And we heard about the letters kept beside his bed
And how he never could forget her or the words she said
That will forever be enshrined and underlined in red
Such sad scenes, so pristine, 8teen
He rode that silver bullet 'cross the borderline
There beneath the maple leaf signed to the Nimbus 9
And the song he hummed that night moves me every time
Fourteen, and so green, 8teen

And for everyone born 8teen runnin' wild and free
From the pearly gates of Heaven to the fiery sea
Know that each will teach of passage through the trinity
God's gift runneth 'ore my cup
Call it a blessing or you call it luck
It all adds up to 8teen
Forever frozen now in time
The night the miracle occurred
They walked on water in my mind
JC and Uncle Herb
Though we never heard the words
It all adds up to 8teen
And for everyone born 8teen runnin' wild and free
From the pearly gates of Heaven to the fiery sea
Know that each will teach of passage through the trinity
God's gift runneth 'ore my cup
Call it a blessing or you call it luck
It all adds up to 8teen

4 ContributorsThe Change Lyrics
One hand reaches out and pulls a lost soul from harm
While a thousand more go unspoken for
And they say what good have you done, by saving just this one
It's like whisperin' a prayer in the fury of a storm

And I hear them sayin', you'll never change things
And no matter what you do it's still the same thing
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so this world will know that it will not change me

This heart still believes that love and mercy still exist
While all the hatreds rage and so many say
That love is all but pointless in madness such as this
It's like tryin' to stop a fire with the moisture from a kiss

And I hear them sayin', you'll never change things
And no matter what you do it's still the same thing
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so this world will know that it will not change me

As long as one heart still holds on
Then hope is never really gone

And I hear them sayin', you'll never change things
And no matter what you do it's still the same thing
But it's not the world that I am changing
I do this so this world we know never changes me

What I do is so, this world will know, that it will not change me

Like birds on a high line
They line up at nighttime at the bar
They all once were lovebirds
Now bluebirds are all that they are
They landed in hell
The minute they fell from love's sky
And now they hope in the wine
That they'll find a new way to fly

A new way to fly
Far away from goodbye
Above the clouds and the rain, the memories and pain
And the tears that they cry
Now the lesson's been learned
They've all crashed and burned
But they can leave it behind if they could just find
A new way to fly

By the end of the night
They'll be high as a kite, once again
And they don't seem to mind all the time
Or the money they spend
And it's a high price to pay
To just find a way to get by
But it's worth every dime
If they find a new way to fly

A new way to fly
Far away from goodbye
Above the clouds and the rain, the memories and pain
And the tears that they cry
Now the lesson's been learned
They've all crashed and burned
But they can leave it behind if they could just find
A new way to fly

They'll leave it behind, as soon as they find
A new way to fly

Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know, the last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise, and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you, said, "Honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain"

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

Well, I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean, to cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well I'll be as high as that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

And I'll be okay

Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases

He wanted to protect me, but somehow my father knew, that

You can cry for 'em, live and die for 'em
You can help them find their wings, but you can't fly for 'em
'Cause if they're not free to fall, then they're not free at all
And though you just can't bear the thought of letting go
You pick 'em up, you dust 'em off
And you send 'em on down the road

A little kiss on a skinned-up knee
From playin' soccer, ridin' bikes, and climbin' trees
And when bad dreams filled their heads
I chased the monsters out from underneath their beds

I guess I always knew those days would end
But the hardest thing I've ever learned has been

You can cry for 'em, live and die for 'em
You can help them find their wings, but you can't fly for 'em
'Cause if they're not free to fall, then they're not free at all
And though you just can't bear the thought of letting go
You pick 'em up, you dust 'em off
And you send 'em on down the road

You can cry for 'em, live and die for 'em
And even though it's gonna break your heart, you let 'em go
You pick 'em up, you dust 'em off
You pull them close, and you pray to God
To send 'em on down the road

Yeah, the high road's a little high to take
I wanna walk a mile the easy way
Wanna take a page from your guiltless book
Wanna let myself off the hook today

Let my conscience have a break

I wish I could be cold like that
Then it wouldn't hurt so bad
I could be the train for a change
You could be the one tied to the track
Baby, wouldn't it be nice
Just to plow through life?
Fall in love, 'cause a crash, walk away without a scratch
And crush hearts like ice

I wish I could be cold like that
So cold like that

Yeah, you burn so hot 'til you get what you want
Guess you got what you wanted
Then your love gets to stop and the temperature drops
Like your heart was haunted

I wish I could be cold like that
Then it wouldn't hurt so bad
I could be the train for a change
You could be the one tied to the track
Baby, wouldn't it be nice
Just to plow through life?
Fall in love, 'cause a crash, walk away without a scratch

Be the bad guy on the other side
I'm the chills
I'm the chills

I wish I could be cold like that
So cold like that

You could be the one tied to the track
Baby, wouldn't it be nice
Just to plow through life?

So cold like that
I wish I could be cold like that
So cold like that

She always says that I'm the rock that she leans on
But it's so hard to believe
'Cause she is always there when I start losin' faith and goin' crazy
She saves me

And every now and then she just wants me to hold her
Whoa, but that don't mean she's weak
The way she unafraid to let her feelings show
Just means she stronger than me

She lifts the weight of this whole world off of my shoulders
With nothin' but the touch of her hand yeah
And every day I wake up and she tells me that she loves me
I feel more like a man

You know I always thought I had to have the answers
Be her strength and take the lead
But when it comes to everything that really matters
She's stronger than me

She lifts the weight of this whole world off of my shoulders
With nothin' but the touch of her hand
And every day I wake up and I tell her that I love her
I feel more like a man

And I'd give her anything in life that's mine to give her
'Til the last breath that I breathe
And if I have a choice, I pray God takes me first

Said we got to talk
So we went for a ride
She said I’m tired of boys
I’m tired of first dates
And I’m tired of toys
I want a lover that will understand
Someone who will touch me with a knowing hand
I am tired of feeling emptiness inside
I want to be the one left satisfied
I looked around and now I’ve made my choice
I’m tired of big talk and I’m tired of noise
I’m tired of boys

Well I sat there for a moment
And I took a deep breath
I told her I was flattered
But most of all I was scared to death
I bet we talked for hours
Bout the demons that we dread
Then we went back to her place and put our fears to rest
Well the boys still talk about her
Though she has moved on down the line
They just can’t figure out why she’s in town from time to time
They bet she’s got a lover
I never say a word
I just smile and keep my head down and bless the day I heard
She said I’m tired of boys
I’m tired of first dates
And I’m tired of toys
I want a lover that will understand
Someone who will touch me with a knowing hand
I am tired of feeling emptiness inside
I want to be the one left satisfied
I looked around and now I’ve made my choice
I’m tired of big talk and I’m tired of noise
I’m tired of boys 

[Song 60: Longneck Bottle]
4 ContributorsLongneck Bottle Lyrics
Longneck bottle let go of my hand
Hey jukebox don't start playing that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle let go of my hand

Hey barroom mirror on the wall
Go stare at someone else
Don't show the world the fool I am
Just keep it to yourself

Longneck bottle let go of my hand
Whoa, jukebox don't start playing that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle let go of my hand
Let it go


Hey, dance floor, seems you're underneath my feet
Everywhere I turn
I ought to waltz right out of them swingin' doors
But that's a step I just can't learn

Longneck bottle let go of my hand
Hey, jukebox don't start playin' that song again
'Cause there's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle let go of my hand

There's a girl at home who loves me
You know she won't understand
Longneck bottle let go of my hand

[Song 61: St. Paul/Minneapolis (A True Story)]
3 ContributorsSt. Paul/Minneapolis (A True Story) Lyrics
It was St. Paul/Minneapolis
Just up the street from where we play
When this stranger brought a happiness
I think about most every day

Lost in search of a solution
You appeared out of the blue
Now I'm left with this illusion
Someday I'll run back into you

'Cause life is hard and sometimes harder
But you were easy as a smile
And all I know is someone's daughter
Has had me wonderin' for a while
Might as well be wishin' upon a distant star
'Cause I don't know who you are

Now I'm not lookin' for relation
And I don't want to change your life
When my heart beats in frustration
Whеn I think of you and wonder why

'Cause love is hard and somеtimes harder
But you were easy as a smile
And all I know is someone's daughter
Has had me wonderin' for a while
But I might as well be wishin' upon a distant star
'Cause only you know who you are

And as I tried to go unnoticed
I never looked into your eyes
So if you did not recognize me
I'm left alone to realize
That my wish will stay forever in the stars
'Cause even you don't know who you are

It was St. Paul/Minneapolis

[Song 62: Wrapped Up In You]
4 ContributorsWrapped Up In You Lyrics
How do I love you. well let me see
I love you like a lyric love a melody
Baby, completely wrapped up in you
How do I need you, well can't you tell
I need you like a penny needs a wishing well
Baby, completely wrapped up in you

Every now and then when the world
That we're living in is crazy
You gladly hold me and carry me through
No one in the world has ever done
What you do for me and I'd be
Sad and lonely if there were no you

How do I love you, well count the ways
There ain't a number high enough to end this phrase
Baby, completely wrapped up in you


How do I love you, well, don't you know
I love you about as deep as any love can grow
Baby, completely wrapped up in you

[Song 63: That’s What Cowboys Do]
3 ContributorsThat’s What Cowboys Do Lyrics
She told me she was lonely and it would be alright
If happy ever after only meant one night
So, we saddled up in satin and rode off for the mornin' sun
Oh, but somewhere 'tween the neon and the mornin' skies
I saw that I was fallin' for those deep blue eyes
And I couldn't help but wonder, "Could this woman be the one?"

Then it came to the leavin' part
When sleepin' beauty nearly had my heart

But a cowboy's always got somewhere to go
Another song to sing, another day to save, another rodeo
They're always leavin' town, chasin' sunsets down, it ain't nothin' new
Yeah, they're just passin' through, that's what cowboys do

I knew that I was in for one hell of a ride
As I drew a bull so cruel they call him Satan's Pride
And the odds of gettin' even started seemin' mighty thin
So, I gave the nod and everybody held on tight
Went dancin' with the devil on a Friday night
Whenever you're in Texas, the cowboy's gonna always win

Then it came to the leavin' part
Well, leavin' Texas always breaks my heart

But a cowboy's always got somewhere to go
Another song to sing, another day to save, another rodeo
They're always leavin' town, chasin' sunsets down, it ain't nothin' new
Yeah, they're just passin' through, that's what cowboys do

They're always leavin' town, chasin' sunsets down, sayin' adios to you
Yeah, we're just passin' through, that's what cowboys do

[Song 64: Victim of the Game]
4 ContributorsVictim of the Game Lyrics
Well, it took a little time, but I guess you finally learned
That promises get broken and bridges do get burned
You've been siftin' through the ashes, just tryin' to find a flame
Holdin' onto nothin', you're a victim of the game

You were standin' way too close to see it all fall apart
And there were things you couldn't hear, 'cause you were listenin' with your heart
But you can't say I didn't warn you, now there's no one else to blame
There's no one quite as blind as a victim of the game

And it don't matter who you are
It treats everyone the same
All you need's a heart
To be a victim of the game

You know it's really gettin' to you when you take to tellin' lies
And you can try to fool your friends, but you can't look 'em in the eyes
There ain't no standin' tall in the shadow of the shame
When everybody knows that you're a victim of the game

And it don't matter who you are
It treats everyone the same
And all you need's a heart
To be a victim of the game

Oh, you know, when I look into your eyes I can really feel the pain
Starin' in the mirror at a victim of the game

[Song 65: The Ship and the Bottle]
2 ContributorsThe Ship and the Bottle Lyrics
I was made for the diving bar
I'm pretty good for a night
I can sure hold my whiskey
And my tequila or wine
You were meant for the ocean
Silver water and wind
You're the ship, I'm the bottle
I'm gonna hold you in

And I don't know how you got here
I know they all wonder too
'Cause when they're looking at us, girl
They're really looking at you
You just might have to break me
To do what you're meant to do
You're the ship, I'm the bottle
I can't do that to you

I wanna stay wrapped around you
But we both know that I can't
So let the breezе fill your sails, girl
And sink your toes in the sand
Maybe I'll writе you a letter
Maybe I'll keep it inside
Maybe someday you'll get it
While you're out chasin' the tide

'Cause I don't know how you got here
I know they all wonder too
'Cause when they're looking at us, girl
They're really looking at you
You just might have to break me
To do what you're meant to do
You're the ship, I'm the bottle
I can't do that to you

You just might have to break me
I know you don't want to
You're the ship, I'm the bottle
I want to keep you, I do
You're the ship, I'm the bottle
I can't do that to you

Sail away, sail like I don't love you
Sail away, sail like I don't need you
Sail away, sail away, my baby

[Song 66: Wolves]
3 ContributorsWolves Lyrics
January's always bitter
But, Lord, this one beats all
The wind ain't quit for weeks now
And the drifts are ten feet tall
I've been all night drivin' heifers
Closer in to lower ground
Then I spent the mornin' thinkin'
About the ones the wolves pulled down

Charlie Barton and his family
Stopped today to say goodbye
He said the bank was takin' over
The last few years were just too dry
And I promised that I'd visit
When they found a place in town
Then I spent a long time thinkin'
About the ones the wolves pulled down

Lord, please shine, a light of hope
On those of us who fall behind
And when we stumble in the snow
Could You help us up, while there's still time?

Well, I don't mean to be complainin', Lord
You've always seen me through
And I know You got Your reasons
For each and every thing you do
But tonight outside my window
There's a lonesome, mournful sound
And I just can't keep from thinkin'
About the ones the wolves pulled down

Oh, Lord, keep me from bein'
The one the wolves pulled down

[Song 67: Courage of Love]
4 ContributorsCourage of Love Lyrics
The fighter in the corner says a prayer before the bell
And there's a soldier in the desert findin’ out that war is hell
There's a veteran on the corner with a story sad to tell
And there's a man in your mirror that knows you all too well

You’re gonna get a million answers to what's a measure of a man
From the softness of his heart to the hardness of his hand
It's always been the same old question, ever since this world began
But a man can't learn a lesson that he don't understand

The hardest thing you'll ever do is to tell someone you're sorry
You'll never be the bravest man if you can’t admit you’re scared
What you do and what you say, the strength it's gonna take to stay
Comes from somewhere high up above, and that’s the courage of love

And any fool can pull the trigger, anyone can start a fight
But to love is so much bigger and so beyond what's black or white
And if we're gonna give our children a future that is bright
Then the truth must be the answer and love is the light

The hardest thing you'll ever do is tell someone you’re sorry
You'll never be the bravest man if you can't admit you're scared
What you do and what you say, the strength it's gonna take to stay
Comes from somewhere high up above, that's the courage of love

And if you're gonna give yourself to somebody else
Then you gotta love someone more than yourself

'Cause the hardest thing you'll ever do is tell someone you're sorry
You'll never be the bravest man if you can't admit you're scared
What you don't do, what you don't say, the strength it takes to walk away
Comes from somewhere high up above, that's the courage of love

The courage of love
That's the courage of love

[Song 68: Cold Shoulder]
1 ContributorCold Shoulder Lyrics
There's a fire burnin' bright, at our house tonight
Slow music playin', and soft candlelight
On her lips I keep tasting, the warm red wine
I'm there in her arms, but it's all in my mind

The snow is piled high, on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea, on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored, somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her, instead of huggin', this old cold shoulder

This old highway is like a woman sometimes
She can be your best friend, but she's the real jealous kind
She's the lady that leads me, to the life I dream of
And she's the mistress that keeps me, from the ones that I love

The snow is piled high, on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea, on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored, somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her, instead of huggin', this old cold shoulder

God, I wish I could hold her
Instead of huggin', this old cold shoulder

[Song 69: Cowboy Bill]
4 ContributorsCowboy Bill Lyrics
He told a good story, and all us kids listened
'Bout his life on the border and the way it was then
And we all believed him and when he would finish
We'd ask the old cowboy to tell 'em again

An' you could almost hear those prairie winds blowin'
His saddle a-creakin', 'neath his old faded jeans
An' you could taste the dry dust from the trail he was ridin'
As he sat there and he painted those west Texas scenes

And the grown-ups would tell us, you boys keep your distance
That old man's just tellin' you lies
But to all us kids, Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true as his blue Texas skies

He told of a time, when he rode with the rangers
Down on the Pecos, and he saved the day
Outnumbered by plenty, they were almost to cover
With thirty banditos headed their way

And he looked back just in time to see a horse stumble
The captain went down, and Bill pulled up on his rains
And through a flurry of bullets he rescued the captain
And they rode for a sunset, just the story remains

And the grown-ups would tell us, you boys keep your distance
That old man's just tellin' you lies
But to all us kids, Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true as his blue Texas skies

Well I still remember the day that it happened
We waited and we waited, but Bill never showed
And the folks at the feed store said they hadn't seen him
So we set out for his place, down Old Grist Mill Road

And we cried when we found him lyin' there with his memories
The old trunk wide open, things scattered about
An' he was clutchin' a badge that said Texas Ranger
And an old yeller letter, said, "Texas Is Proud"

And those grown-ups that told us, you boys keep your distance
That old man's just tellin' you lies
Now, they're all sayin' that Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true as his blue Texas skies

Just as true, as his blue Texas skies

[Song 70: Dixie Chicken]
3 ContributorsDixie Chicken Lyrics
I seen the bright lights of Memphis
And the Commodore Hotel
And it was there beneath the streetlamp
Where I met a southern belle
Well, she took me to the river
Where she cast her spell
And it was 'neath that Memphis moonlight
She sang this song so well

If you'll be my Dixie chicken
Hey, I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixieland
Down in Dixieland

We hit all the hotspots
Hey, my money flowed like wine
'Til the lowdown southern whiskey, yeah
Began to fog my mind
Well, I don't remember church bells
Or the money I put down
On the white picket fence and boardwalk
At the house on the edge of town
Now, but boy do I remember
The strain of her refrain
And the nights we spent together
And the way she called my name

If you'll be my Dixie chicken
Hey, I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixieland
Down in Dixieland
Yodelay-delay-hee


It's been a year since she ran away
Guess that guitar player sure could play
She always liked to sing along
He was always handy with a song
Then one night in the lobby
Of the Commodore Hotel
I by chance met a bartender
Who said he knew her well
And as he handed me a drink
He began to hum a song
And all the boys there at the bar
Began to sing along

If you'll be my Dixie chicken
Hey, I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixieland
Down in Dixieland

If you'll be my Dixie chicken
I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixieland
Down in Dixieland
Yodelay-delay-hee

1 ContributorIt’s Your Song Lyrics
Standing in the spotlight
On such a perfect night
Knowing that your out there listening
I remember one time
When I was so afraid
Didn't think I had the courage
To stand up on this stage
Then you reached into my heart
And you found the melody
And if there ever was somebody
Who made me believe in me
It was you
It was you

It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song

Every night I pray
Before the music starts to play
That I'll do my best and I won't let you down
And for all the times I've stood here
This feeling feels brand new
And any time I doubt myself I think of you

Because It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song
Dreams can come true
With God's great angels like you

It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song
It was your song
It's always been your song

[Song 72: He Really Loves You]
2 ContributorsHe Really Loves You LyricsFive o'clock traffic, all four lanes are down to a crawl
He's sitting there knowing that he's going nowhere at all
Then finally he sees the wreck
And says a prayer for whoever they are
Then everything changes the second he sees it's her car

He really loves you
And God knows it's true
And it's something he'd say
And he'd tell you each day
It was the way that He knew
But to some of us guys, we don't realize
How to say it is just not what we do
And it's so hard to see, but take it from me
He really loves you
Down on the shoulder, he's running as fast as he can
Dying to hold her, he's truly a desperate man
And he falls to his knees at the wreck
Up close it all looks so much worse
Same color, same model, but the car in the crash isn't hers

He really loves you
And God knows it's true
And it's something he'd say
And he'd tell you each day
It was the way that He knew
But to some of us guys, we don't realize
How to say it is just not what we do
And it's so hard to see, but take it from me
He really loves you

And he'll come home tonight like everything is alright
Like nothing's changed, but it's simply not true
If you'd been there today, then you'd see the way
He really loves you

Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonight
Shinin' through the trees
Crickets are singin' and lightnin' bugs
Are floatin' on the breeze
Baby, get ready

Across the field where the crick turns back
By the old stump road
I'm gonna take you to a special place
That nobody knows
Baby, get ready

You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
Feels so good to be with you

Spring is almost over and the summer's comin'
The days are gettin' long
I've waited all winter for the time to be right
Just to take you along
Baby, get ready

And it don't matter if we sit forever
And the fish don't bite
We'll jump in the river and cool ourselves
From the heat of the night
Baby, get ready

You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
Feels so good to be with you

You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
You and me goin' fishin' in the dark

1 ContributorNot Counting You Lyrics
When loving turns to parting, I'm always the first to leave
'Cause when it comes to heartaches I'd rather give than to receive
I've never cried myself to sleep just praying I'll get through
I've never lost at love not counting you

Not counting you, I've never had a heartache
Not counting you, I never have been blue
There's no exceptions to the rule, I've never been nobody's fool
I've never lost at love not counting you

I've never got down on my knees and asked the Lord above
If He would only bring to me the one I'm dreaming of
Begging to be taken back and swearin' I'll be true
Has never crossed my mind not counting you

Not counting you, I've never had a heartache
Not counting you, I never have been blue
There's no exceptions to the rule, I've never been nobody's fool
I've never lost at love not counting you

There's no exceptions to the rule, I've never been nobody's fool
I've never lost at love not counting you
No, I've never lost at love not counting you

Hey, all the neighbors lights
Came on last night
Just like they do every time
We have a little fight
It's gettin' to the point
We can't get along
We're always fightin' 'bout things
That should be dead and gone

We bury the hatchet
But leave the handle stickin' out
We're always diggin' up things
We should forget about
When it comes to forgivin'
Baby, there ain't no doubt
We bury the hatchet
But leave the handle stickin' out

Well, I was kissin' on Cindy
Hey, that I won't deny
But that's a long time ago
I let a dead dog lie
But if you want to cut deep
How about you and old Joe
I caught you down at the creek
Just ten years ago

We bury the hatchet
But leave the handle stickin' out
We're always diggin' up things
We should forget about
When it comes to forgivin'
Baby, there ain't no doubt
We bury the hatchet
But leave the handle stickin' out

Hey, we got enough on each other
To wage a full scale war
If we could ever remember
What we were fightin' for

We bury the hatchet
But leave the handle stickin' out
We're always diggin' up things
We should forget about
When it comes to forgivin'
Baby, there ain't no doubt
We bury the hatchet
But leave the handle stickin' out

Woah, we bury the hatchet
But leave the handle stickin' out

[Song 76: Burning Bridges]
1 ContributorBurning Bridges Lyrics
Yesterday she thanked me for oilin' that front door
This mornin' when she wakes she won't be thankful anymore
She'll never know how much I cared, just that I couldn't stay
And I'll never know the reason why I always run away

Burning bridges, one by one
What I'm doin' can't be undone
And I'm always hopin' someday
I'm gonna stop this runnin' 'round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Last night we talked of old times, families and hometowns
She wondered if we'd both agree on where we'd settle down
And I told her that we'd cross that bridge whenever it arrived
Now through the flames, I see her standin' on the other side

Burning bridges, one by one
What I'm doin', can't be undone
And I'm always hopin' someday
I'm gonna stop this runnin' 'round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Like ashes on the water, I drift away in sorrow
Knowing that the day my lesson's finally learned
I'll be standin' at a river, starin' out across tomorrow
And the bridge I need to get there will be a bridge that I have burned

Burning bridges, one by one
What I'm doin', can't be undone
And I'm always hopin' someday
I'm gonna stop this runnin' 'round
But every time the chance comes up
Another bridge goes down

Another bridge goes down

[Song 77: Alabama Clay]
2 ContributorsAlabama Clay Lyrics
First time he saw the ground get busted
He was ten and it was 1952
His daddy worked hard from sunup to sundown
And the goin' got tough behind them old gray mules

The farm grew to be a moneymaker
And the house he lived in grew up room by room
The boy worked hard but soon got tired of farmin'
So he slipped away one night 'neath the harvest moon

His neck was red as Alabama clay
But the city's call pulled him away
He's got a factory job and runs a big machine
He don't miss the farm or the fields of green

Now the city's just a prison without fences
His job is just a routine he can't stand
And at night he dreams of wide-open spaces
Fresh dirt between his toes and on his hands

Then one day a picture came inside a letter
Of a young girl with a baby in her arms
And the words she wrote would change his life forever
So he went to raise his family on the farm

His neck is red as Alabama clay
Now he's goin' home this time to stay
Where the roots run deep on the family tree
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green

His neck is red as Alabama clay
Now he's goin' home this time to stay
Where the roots run deep on the family tree
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green

His neck is red... as Alabama clay

[Song 78: The Fever]
5 ContributorsThe Fever Lyrics
He's got a split finger wrap and his rope's pulled way to tight
He's got a lunatic smile 'cause he's really drawn deep tonight

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever

Grab a hold of anything and hold on tight
It hits you like the venom from a rattle snake bite
We are here 'cause he's not all there tonight

He takes one last breath and time turns inside out
Then the gate busts open to the world he dreams about

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever

Stick a rope on anything because he don't care
He'd even take a ride on the electric chair
We are here 'cause he's not all there tonight

He says it's really kind of simple, keep your mind in the middle
While your butt spins 'round and 'round

Take heed to Sankey's preachin', keep liftin' and reachin'
And riding like there ain't no clowns

What he loves might kill him, but he's got no choice
He's a different breed, with a voice down deep inside
That's screamin' he was born to ride

He's got a fever, fever, fever, fever

Fever makes you crazy 'cause it makes no sense
Like runnin' from your shadow out of self-defense
But he won't run and baby he can't hide
He thinks the odds are even leavin' one hand tied

He gets so tired of hangin' on so tight
I know you think he's crazy, well, I think you're right
We are here 'cause he's not all there that's right

[Song 79: The Storm]
3 ContributorsThe Storm Lyrics
She sits among the pieces
Of broken glass and photographs
Reluctantly releases
The last of what was her past

It struck without a warning
Or did she just ignore the signs
In those dark clouds forming
Behind her silver lines

And the door, it slammed like thunder
And the tears, they fell like rain
And the warnings from her family
Swirl like a hurricane
Oh, she's drowning in emotions
And she cannot reach the shore
She's alive
But, can she survive the storm

A broken jewel box dancer
Lies in pieces down the hall
She's finding out the answers
Don't change, nothing at all

It's time that she stopped searching
For who's to blame or what went wrong
The only thing for certain
Is he's gone, she's gotta move on

Then a door was slammed like thunder
And the tears, they fall like rain
And the warnings from her family
Swirl like a hurricane
Oh, she's drowning in emotions
And she cannot reach the shore
She's alive
But, can she survive the storm

Someday days just roll on by
Without a gray cloud in the sky
She keeps telling herself
"I will make it on my own"
And her friends
They've all gone back to their lives
Thinkin' she will be alright
As she races through the night, to make it home

And the door it slams like thunder
And the tears, they fall like rain
And the warnings from her family
Swirl like a hurricane
Oh, she's drowning in emotions
And she cannot reach the shore
She's alive
But, can she survive the storm

She sits among the pieces
Of broken glass and photographs
Reluctantly releases
The last of what was her past

Jesus, our brother kind and good
Was humbly born in a stable of wood
And the friendly beasts around him stood
Jesus our brother kind and good

"I" said the donkey shaggy and brown
I carried his mother up hill and down
I carried him safely to Bethlehem town
"I" said the donkey shaggy and brown

And "I" said the cow all white and red
I gave him my manger for a bed
I gave him my hay for to pillow his head
"I" said the cow all white and red

"I" said the sheep with a curly horn
I have him my wool for his blanket warm
And he wore my coat on that Christmas morn
"I" said the sheep with a curly horn

"I" said the dove from the rafters high
Cooed him to sleep that he should not cry
We cooed him to sleep my love and I
"I" said the dove from the rafters high

And "I" said the camel all yellow and black
Over the desert upon my back
I brought him a gift in the wise men's pack
"I" said the camel all yellow and black

Thus every beast remembering it well
In the stable dark was so proud to tell
Of the gifts that they gave Emmanuel
The gifts that they gave Emmanuel

[Song 81: Mr. Blue]
3 ContributorsMr. Blue Lyrics
Our guardian star lost all its glow
The day that I lost you
It lost all its glitter the day you said no
And its grey skies turned to blue
Like him, I am doubtful
That your love is true
So, if you decide to call on me
Ask for Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue, when you say you love me
Then prove it by goin' out on the sly
Provin' your love is untrue
Call me Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue, when you say you're sorry
Then turn around headed for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue

I sleep alone each night
Wait by the phone each night
But you don't call, and I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mister...
I won't tell you when you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too
But I'm painting it blue


I sleep alone each night
Wait by the phone each night
But you don't call,and I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mister...
I won't tell you when you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too
But I'm painting it blue

Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mister...

[Song 82: The Old Stuff]
1 ContributorThe Old Stuff Lyrics
Whoa I said a little prayer tonight, 'fore I came on stage
As I came walking past the drivers and the locals on the union wage
I asked the dear Lord up in heaven, let me treat the music right
Then I prayed that Detroit, goes wild tonight

Seven pickers and all our gear in a rental van
Playin' music, never sleepin', and workin' on a neon tan
We played The Barn down in Sanford, Florida, for Bev Roberts out in Camden Park
We plugged it in up east at Bull Run and the place went dark

Back when the old stuff was new
Back before the buses and the hard workin' boys in the crew
Well, it was one big party, but the papers called it payin' our dues
Back when the old stuff was new

Oh, the stories we could tell if it weren't for the code of the road
About The Buckboard, Bear Creek, Cowboys, and the Grizzly Rose
You know the weather turned bad in Scottsdale, a tornado nearly stole the show
But we just danced in the rain and listened to the thunder roll

Back when the old stuff was new
Hats off to the K.C. Opry and Ella Guru
It was one big party, Uncle Joe, you know we owe it to you
Back when the old stuff was new

No rules, young fools, comin' from the old school, takin' on the world alone
Next date, can't wait, tearin' up the interstate, every place we played was home
Balls out, no doubt, this is what it's all about, beggin' for a place to play
Swingin' with our low friends, prayin' that it never ends, wouldn't trade a single day

Back when the old stuff was new
Back before the buses and the hard workin' boys in the crew
It was one big party, but the papers called it payin' our dues
Back when the old stuff was new

Hey it's still one big party, you can call it whatever you choose
You make me feel like the old stuff is new

[Song 83: Against The Grain]
5 ContributorsAgainst The Grain Lyrics
Folks call me a maverick, guess I ain't too diplomatic
I just never been the kind to go along
Just avoidin' confrontation, for the sake of conformation
And I'll admit I tend to sing a different song
But sometimes you just can't be afraid to wear a different hat
If Columbus had complied this old world might still be flat
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain

Well, I've been accused of makin' my own rules
There must be rebel blood just a-runnin' through my veins
But I ain't no hypocrite, so what you see is what you get
And that's the only way I know to play the game
Ol' Noah took much ridicule for buildin' his great ark
But after forty days and forty nights he was lookin' pretty smart
Sometimes it's best to brave the wind and rain
By havin' strength to go against the grain


Hell, there's more folks than a few who share my point of view
But they're worried If they're gonna sink or swim
They'd like to buck the system, but the deck is stacked against 'em
And they are a little scared to go out on a limb
But if you're gonna make a difference, if you're gonna leave your mark
You can't follow like a bunch of sheep, you gotta listen to your heart
Go bustin' in like old John Wayne
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain

Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain

[Song 84: Me Without You]
2 ContributorsMe Without You Lyrics
Couldn't make the red light
Now I'm starin' at a homeless man
Credit cards in my pocket
And a sign of the times in his hand

And as I sat there and wondered
Just why I'm on this side of the door
That's when it shook me like thunder
That I knew this man from somewhere before

All day long I kept thinkin'
I couldn't get the man out of my head
Three a.m., it hit me
In a cold sweat, I sat up in bed

That would be me without you
Every day would be nothin' new
I'd only have lonely to hold onto
That would be me without you

I saw a man on the TV
Well, he looked like a regular Joe
But his story would lead me
Down a path that no good man should go

And now his friends are all wonderin'
How could he do such an unthinkable crime?
My bet is he lost his woman
And the next thing he lost was his mind

That would be me without you
Every day would be nothin' new
I'd only have lonely to hold onto
That would be me without you

Every day he brings flowers
As his love and him talk all alone
I've seen him sit there for hours
By himself in that garden of stone

That would be me without you
Every day would be nothin' new
I'd only have lonely to hold onto
That would be me without you

That would be me without you

[Song 85: Baby, Let’s Lay Down and Dance]
4 ContributorsBaby, Let’s Lay Down and Dance Lyrics
I get this feeling that I can’t explain
Every time I see your face or hear your name
I just go crazy
Thinking baby this may be my chance
What would you say to me
If I said baby let’s lay down and dance?

I got to tell you girl, you drive me wild
Every time I see you dance I see that smile
My world gets hazy
And I’m moving like I’m in a trance
Whoa, I know it’s crazy
But baby let’s lay down and dance

When it comes to love
My heart is black and it’s blue
Swore I was through with romance
But girl you’re something
And I'm counting on you
You’re my brand new second chance

My friends all tell me that I’m not your kind
They say I better pray your love is blind
You got to save me
I’m a victim of your circumstance
Whoa, I know it’s crazy
But baby let’s lay down and dance

When it comes to love
My heart is black and it’s blue
Thought I was through with romance
But girl you’re something
And I have nothing to lose
You’re my brand new second chance

I got to tell you girl you drive me wild
I’ve never known no one with quite your style
I’m going crazy
Thinking baby this may be my chance
What would you say to me
If I said baby let’s lay down and dance?
Girl, I know it’s crazy
But baby let’s lay down and dance

3 ContributorsA Friend to Me Lyrics
Well, you and I, we're buddies
And we've been since we first met
An' me and you, well, we've sure been through
Our share of laughter and regret

Lord knows we've had our bad days
And more than once we've disagreed
But you've always been a friend to me

You can be so stubborn
There's times I think you just like to fight
And I hope and pray I live to see a day
When you say I might be right

And there's times I'd rather kill you
Than listen to your honesty
But you've always been a friend to me

You've always been, time and again
The one to take my hand
And show to me that it's okay to be
Just the way I am, with no apology

Oh, you've always been
And you will 'til God knows when
Yes, you've always been a friend to me

[Song 87: You Move Me]
2 ContributorsYou Move Me Lyrics
This is how it seems to me
Life is only therapy
Real expensive
And no guarantee
So I lie here on the couch
With my heart hanging out
Frozen solid with fear
Like a rock in the ground

But you move me
You give me courage I didn't
Know I had
You move me on
I can't go with you
And stay where I am
So you move me on

This is how love was to me
I could look and not see
Going through the emotions
Not knowing what they mean
And it scared me so much
That I just wouldn't budge
I might have stayed there forever
If not for your touch

Oh but you move me
Out of myself and into the fire
You move me
Now I'm burning with love
And with hope and desire
How you move me

You go whistling in the dark
Making light of it
And I follow with my heart
Laughing all the way

Oh because you move me
You get me dancing and you
Make me sing
You move me
Now I'm taking delight
In every little thing
How you move me

[Song 88: I Don’t Have To Wonder]
3 ContributorsI Don’t Have To Wonder Lyrics
Drove to the church in my suit and tie
But I just couldn't bring myself to go inside
So, I sat alone in my truck across the street
Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes by that long white limousine

And I could just imagine what was goin' on in there
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass and those flowers in your hair

And in less time than it takes a tear to fall
Those bells rang loud as thunder
As they opened up the doors
Now I don't have to wonder anymore

Laughin' and a cryin', tossin' that bouquet
And when you got in that limo I drove off the other way
And I still don't know why things happened like they did
But I parked that old pickup on that lonesome river bridge

I took your ring from my pocket and I held it one last time
Watched that diamond sparkle, I drew back and I let her fly

And in less time than it takes to tear to fall
Oh, that old ring went under
Lord, and now it's gone for sure
No and I don't have to wonder anymore

Well, the angels sang like thunder
As I felt myself go under
Now I don't have to wonder anymore

It's midnight Cinderella, but don't you worry none
'Cause I'm Peter Peter the Pumpkin Eater and the party's just begun

I guess your prince charmin', wasn't after all
'Cause he sure seemed different, right after the ball
I guess more than horses are turnin' into rats
And by the way he's walkin', I can guess where your slipper's at

It's midnight Cinderella, time that you should know
There's gonna be some changes in the way this story goes
It's midnight Cinderella, but don't you worry none
'Cause I'm Peter Peter the Pumpkin Eater and the party's just begun

I'm gonna help you get over, bein' under that spell
You are gonna learn to love midnight, inside this pumpkin shell
I got to few new magic tricks, your godmother can't do
I'll show you what it means to bip, bip, bip, bip, boppity-boo

It's midnight Cinderella, time that you should know
There's gonna be some changes in the way this story goes
It's midnight Cinderella, but don't you worry none
'Cause I'm Peter Peter the Pumpkin Eater and the party's just begun

It's Peter Peter the Pumpkin Eater and the party has now begun

[Song 90: When There’s No One Around]
1 ContributorWhen There’s No One Around Lyrics
This is a song that nobody knows
I couldn't begin to describe how it goes
But it makes me cry or laugh right out loud
It's a song that I sing when there's no one around
This is the man that nobody sees
He wears my old clothes and he looks just like me
Just one of the boys who gets lost in the crowd
He's the man that I am when there's no one around

It's four in the morning
I'm lying in bed
A tape of my failures
Playing inside my head
It's heartaches and hard knocks
And things I don't know
I listen and I wonder
Where will it go

This is a glimpse of the child that's within
He's so immature but he's still my best friend
If he could learn how to fly he'd never touch down
He's the kid that I am when there's no one around
This is the dance I do every day
I let my feet go and get carried away
I let my soul lead and follow the sound
It's the dance that I do when there's no one around

It's four in the morning
I'm lying in bed
A tape of my failures
Playing inside my head
It's heartaches and hard knocks
And things I don't know
I listen and I wonder
Where will it go

This is a song that nobody knows
I still can't begin to describe how it goes
But it makes me cry or laugh right out loud
It's a song that I sing when there's no one around

[Song 91: Night Rider’s Lament]
4 ContributorsNight Rider’s Lament Lyrics
One night while I was out a-ridin'
The graveyard shift, midnight 'til dawn
The moon was bright as a readin' light
For a letter from an old friend back home

And he asked me, why do you ride for your money
Tell me why do you rope for short pay
You ain't a-gettin' nowhere and you're losin' your share
Boy, you must've gone crazy out there

He said, "Last night I ran on to Jenny
And she's married and she has a good life
Boy, you sure missed the track, when you never came back
She's the perfect professional's wife"

And she asked me, "Why does he ride for his money?
Tell me why does he rope for short pay?
He ain't a-gettin' nowhere and he's losin' his share
Boy, he must've gone crazy out there"

Aw, but they've never seen the Northern Lights
They've never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never spent spring at the Great Divide
And they've never heard ol' Camp Cookie sing

So, I read up the last of my letter
And I tore off the stamp for black Jim
And when Billy rode up to relieve me
He just looked at my letter and he grinned

And he said, "Now why do they ride for their money?
Tell me why do they ride for short pay?
They ain't a-gettin nowhere, and they're losin' their share
Boy, they must have gone crazy out there"

Son, they all must be crazy out there

I'm leavin'
The words fall out my mouth and onto the floor
I'm needin', yeah
To pack up my bags and walk right out the door
This is goodbye
I'll roll the windows down in my old Chevrolet
Don't know where I'm goin'
I just know that I can't stay

Might make it to Memphis
But that ain't far enough
I'll speed down the highway to Tulsa, Missouri
So fast that the hurt can't catch up
I'm burnin' your memory
One mile at a time
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind

I'm thinkin'
With a truck stop song and a cold cup of coffee
I'm drinkin'
Yeah, I'm hurtin' like hell, but honey how could I not be
You made me
Oh, the joke and the fool, the last one to know
So, I'm gonna put mountains and deserts and rivers between us
Go as far as I can go

Might make it to Memphis
That ain't far enough
I'll speed down the highway to Tulsa, Missouri
So fast that the hurt can't catch up
I'm burnin' your memory
One mile at a time
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind

Might leave some tears in Topeka
A couple sleepless nights in Cheyenne
Every time that I miss you, baby
I'll hit the gas as fast as I can

Might make it to Memphis
The Kansas City line
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind
All the way to Tacoma
By then I hope you're out of my mind

[Song 93: Cowboys and Angels]
1 ContributorCowboys and Angels Lyrics
On the eighth day, God noticed a problem
For there below Him, stood a cowboy alone
Stubborn and proud, reckless and loud
God knew he'd never make it on his own

So God looked out all over creation
And listened as that cowboy prayed
God took passion and thunder, patience and wonder
Then He sent down the best thing that God ever made

Cowboys and angels, leather and lace
Salt of the earth, meets heavenly grace
Cowboys and angels, tested and tried
It's a long way to heaven, and one hell of a ride

Nothin's changed since the dawn of creation
For you will find them together today
And only heaven above 'em, knows why she loves him
But he must be the reason, she don't fly away

Cowboys and angels, leather and lace
Salt of the earth, meets heavenly grace
Cowboys and angels, tested and tried
It's a long way to heaven, and one hell of a ride

It's a long way to heaven, and one hell of a ride

[Song 94: Which One of Them]
1 ContributorWhich One of Them Lyrics
The girl at the bar, she bought me a beer
And she'd like to know if I'm new around here
And the gal that I danced with says she's all alone
Her friends have all left and she needs a ride home
Oh and there have been others who gave me the eye
But if they only knew they were wasting their time
Because there's only one lover I can give my heart to
But you didn't want it and you broke it in two

(So tell me) which one of them will you be tonight
Oh which one will hold me in your arms so tight
I've forgotten what's wrong, given up on what's right
(Tell me) which one of them will you be tonight

So I'll just smile and pretend and she'll never know
Who she's up against when she's holding me close
You're all that I want, girl, you're all that I need
And when I close my eyes, honey you're all I see

(So tell me) which one of them will you be tonight
Oh which one will hold me in your arms so tight
I've forgotten what's wrong, given up on what's right
(Tell me) which one of them will you be tonight

And the oil fields fed our family

To the American Dream

[Song 96: Fit For A King]
3 ContributorsFit For A King Lyrics
His pulpit's a corner on 19th and Main
His grip on the gospel, his one claim to fame
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passing by
And he offers salvation for the savior on high

His khakis are tattered and he hasn't bathed in weeks
His bout with the bottle shows up on his cheeks
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold
As he works for the shepherd bringing lambs to the fold

He points to the Bible he holds in his hand
Says I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man

Son, it ain't what you are drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
And someday in heaven when the angels all sing
Well, these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king

He's fightin' a fever, but in spite of the chill
He pulls up his collar and he speaks of God's will
His body is weakened, but his faith is still strong
For he's filled with conviction for the mission he's on

He knows soon in heaven he'll be homeless no more
As his work will soon echo from that far distant shore

Son, it ain't what you are drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
And someday in heaven when the angels all sing
Well, these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king

Someday in heaven when the angels all sing
Well, these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king
Will be fit for a king

[Song 97: The Night Will Only Know]
3 ContributorsThe Night Will Only Know Lyrics
That night will live forever, their first time to lie together
They were finally where desire dared them to go
Both belonging to another, but longing to be lovers
Promising each other that the night will only know

Parked on some old backstreet, they laid down in the backseat
And fell into the fire down below
But they would pay for their deceiving, for a deadly web was weaving
Why they picked that spot that evening, Lord, the night will only know

Well within the innuendos, just outside the steamy windows
The night was shattered by a woman's scream
Motionless and frightened, the grip of fate had tightened
And with trembling hands they wiped away the steam

They saw a woman pleading, stumbling, begging, and retreating
Till she became the victim of her foe
And they watched her fall in silence, to save their own alliance
But the reason for the violence, just the night will only know

And every paper ran the story, she was stripped of all her glory
And they told exactly how the woman died
Abandoned and forsaken, too many pills were taken
And they ruled the woman's death a suicide

Bound by their behavior, they could have been her savior
Now guilt becomes an endless debt they owe
But another crime was committed, and it's never been admitted
Have the guilty been acquitted, Lord, the night will only know

Don't waste your life behind that guitar
You may get gone, but you won't get far
You're not the first, boy you won't be the last
And you can tell us all about it when you come crawlin' back
Cause that road you're on, it just winds and winds
You're spinning your wheels, and wastin' your time

But when the lights come up and I hear the band
And where they said I'd never be is right here where I stand
I see the crowd and I look around, and I can't find an empty chair
Not bad for a boy goin' nowhere

Now I get these calls, out on the road
Yeah we heard your song on the radio
We always said you'd make it big back then
Yeah and I tell everybody that I knew you back when
So don't forget us little folks
When you crash and burn, remember we told you so

But then the lights come up and I hear the band
And where they said I'd never be is right here in Spokane
I see the crowd and I look around, and I can't find an empty chair
Not bad for a guy goin' nowhere

And I need to thank the Father for every song I sing
And for everyone who ever said I'd never be anything
It took a whole lot of 'yes I wills' and 'I don't cares'
A lot of run down dives and bars and rain soaked fairs
To get to all of you down here and way back there
Not bad for a guy goin' nowhere
Not bad for a boy goin' nowhere

Doctor, you ain't got a pill
For whatever's makin' this world ill
You can't get forgiveness at the store
And peace, it's a politician's war

You won't find no resolution in the bottom of a bottle
In the stars or Aristotle, the only answer to the problem is

People lovin' people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people lovin' people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah

Words aren't what they seem to be
Talk is cheap but lies are free
We fear what we don't understand
And we've been scared since time began

All the colors and the cultures circle 'round us on a spindle
It's a complicated riddle, the solution is so simple

It's people lovin' people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people lovin' people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah

You can pawn it off on kings and queens and those behind the curtain
Say one can't make a difference in a world so full of hurtin'
But I believe the remedy starts right here with you and me

People lovin' people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people lovin' people
It's just people lovin' people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah

You gotta love livin' in the 6-1-5

That whistle blowin' means the workday's done
Now we're goin' out to have some fun
I guess it doesn't matter where you're from, we're the same
'Cause we all want that place where we can go
To share a beer and hear what moves our soul
That home away from home where they all know your name

So just come in and pull you up a seat
There's lots of friends to make and  to eat

It's all good, it's alright
Everybody in the joint, have fun tonight
It's alright, it's all good
In our neon neighborhood

Now lately she's the boss across the street
The vibe is old school and the crowd is sweet
The kind of people that you'd like to meet again
And again and again and again
Up on the corner, there sits Willie's bar
On whiskey night, that's where the new kids are
And you can see them there before their stars begin
With all your low friends

Lord brought 'em up to Music Row
There's only one thing that you need to know

It's all good, it's alright
Everybody on the street, have fun tonight
It's alright, it's all good
In our neon neighborhood

From lower Broad on up to Music Row
There's only one thing that you need to know

It's all good, it's alright
Everybody on the strip, have fun tonight
It's alright, it's all good
In our neon neighborhood

It's all good, it's alright
Everybody in the joint, have fun tonight
It's alright, it's all good
In our neon neighborhood

It's all good, it's alright
Everybody in the house, have fun tonight
It's alright, it's all good

1 ContributorCowgirl’s Saddle Lyrics
Last thing I remember was saying
"Hey y'all, watch this." Next thing I know I'm walking toward this light
When a voice from out of nowhere asked this question
"Garth, what did you love most in your past life?"
"Well," I said, "it had to be between cowgirls and horses."
And as I wondered which one that I would settle on
The voice said, "May you be happy with your answer."
I said, "What answer?" He said, "Watch this." And I was gone

Now I'm back as a cowgirl's saddle
Heaven on Earth for all eternity
Forever in between
Every cowboy's dream
Riding horses, holding rodeo queens

Sew me, show me, throw me in the pickup
Take me, break me, make me what you need
It's safe to say we're made for one another
And you'll never fall if you just stick with me
Fit me, sit me, get me how you want me
Wrap me, SLAP ME, STRAP ME ON YOUR STEED
Can't believe I'm out here flying with an angel
Oh this afterlife's sure looking up for me

Cause now I'm back as a cowgirl's saddle
Heaven on Earth for all eternity
Forever in between
Every cowboy's dream
Riding horses, holding rodeo queens

Loping, roping, hoping that you're happy
Racing, placing, chasing all your dreams
Makes me think if I'd lived life a little better
Would I've come back as a pair of cowgirl jeans

Now I'm back as a cowgirl's saddle
Heaven on Earth for all eternity
Forever in between
Every cowboy's dream
Riding horses, holding rodeo queens

Every cowboy's dream
You know just what I mean
Riding horses, holding rodeo queens

Details can somehow slip your mind
Something so sweet, though incomplete
You fill the spaces in between
It never will be that way again
Maybe it wasn't, way back when
To my heart and soul
This is the way the story has to be told
That's the way, I remember it, I remember it that way
From the day, I was living there, I remember it that way

Some of our stories fade as we grow older
Some get sweeter every time they're told
That's the way, I'll remember you that way

Guess now, if the truth were known
Among diamonds they were stones
To say would be fair, girl
Nothing compares to when I called you all my own
So darling, don't ever you think twice
Those were the best days of my life
When I held you there and I'll tell this story
This way, time and again

That's the way, I remember it, I remember it that way
From the day, I was living there, I remember it that way

Oh, that's the way, I remember it, I remember it that way
From the day, I was living there, I remember it that way

Some of our stories fade as we grow older
Some get sweeter every time they're told
That's the way, I'll remember you
That's the way, I'll remember you that way

[Song 103: Message in a Bottle]
3 ContributorsMessage in a Bottle Lyrics
I put a message in a bottle
And I walked down to the sea
Like the waves upon the water
The thought kept comin' back to me
That this old world could use some lovin'
Just some simple TLC
I put a message in a bottle
And made a wish and set it free

I put a message in a bottle
And then I asked the stars above
For anybody who may find it
To open happiness and love
And hear the sounds of children laughin'
And people dancin' in the street
I put a message in a bottle
And madе a wish and set it free

I guess I've always been a drеamer
But I've seen where dreams can lead
For in the hearts of all believers
There's only possibilities
I hope it sees a billion faces
I hope it goes a million miles
I put a message in a bottle
And hope it brings this world a smile

I put a message in a bottle
And then I asked the stars above
For anybody who may find it
To open happiness and love
Hear the sounds of children laughin'
People dancin' in the street
I put a message in a bottle
And made a wish and set it free

For every one of us has a message
A purpose and a destiny
If you put a message in a bottle
What would that message be?

I put a message in a bottle
And then I asked the Lord above
For anybody who may find it
To open happiness and love
Hear the sounds of children laughin'
People dancin' in the street
I put a message in a bottle
And made a wish and set it free
I put a message in a bottle
And made a wish and set it free

[Song 104: It Don’t Matter To The Sun]
2 ContributorsIt Don’t Matter To The Sun Lyrics
It don't matter to the sun
If you go or if you stay
I know the sun is going to rise
Shine down on another day
There still be a tomorrow
Even if you choose to leave
Because it don't matter to the sun, oh baby
It matters to me
It ain't going to stop the world
If you walk out that door
This old world will just keep turning 'round, turning 'round
Like it did the day before
Because see to them it makes no difference, ohh
It just keep on keeping time
Because it ain't going to stop the world out there
But it'll be the end of mine
What can I say?
What can I do?
I'm still in love
So why aren't you?
Oh yeah, oh yeah
What can I say?
What can I do?
I'm still in love
So why aren't you?
It don't matter to the moon
If you're not in my life
No the moon will just keep hanging around, hanging around
Like it's just another night
Find another place to shine on down
On some other lover's dreams
Because it don't matter to the moon, oh baby
But it sure do matter to me

No it don't matter to the moon, oh baby
But it matters to me

[Song 105: Man Against Machine]
3 ContributorsMan Against Machine Lyrics
Papa
They're waitin' just outside my door
This is where I make my stand
'Cause I can't stand it anymore
Papa
They have no heart and soul
But make no doubt about it
They're the ones that's in control
So, prepare yourself for a war unlike you've ever seen
Mm, this is man against machine
(Work, work, work)

Day in, day out
Bust your back and turn it out
Next mornin', do it all again
Hard job or two
So, your children won't have to
That's just the way it's always been

But lately I swear the machines
Are livin' the American dream

Careful calculations
Details drawn down to design
Is it really for the better
Or a better bottom line?
Don't know me from Adam
Man, it's rotten to the core
It's gonna to get reminded
Man has kicked its ass before
John Henry's 'bout to show on the scene
In this war of man against the machine
(Work, work, work)

Up early, up hill
Spend your youth to pay the bills
Each generation makes a trade
Top floor, brass tacks
Cold's the hand that holds the axe
Acts like my dues have not been paid

But pay attention now when I say
Formation isn't happenin' today

Careful calculations
Details drawn down to design
Is it really for the better
Or a better bottom line?
Don't know me from Adam
Man, it's rotten to the core
It's gonna to get reminded
Man has kicked its ass before
John Henry's 'bout to blow off some steam
In this war of man against the machine
(Work, work, work
Work, work, work)

Papa
The power's out, the machines are down
In this world of darkness
I can still hear a sound
Papa
That sound tears us apart
'Cause I'm a machine myself
But I'm one with a workin' heart

Careful calculations
Details drawn down to design
Is it really for the better
Or a better bottom line?
Don't know me from Adam
Man, it's rotten to the core
It's gonna to get reminded
Man has kicked its ass before
The gloves are off, no love lost between
This war of man against the machine

(Work, work, work) Against the machine
(Work, work, work) Against the machine
(Work, work, work) Against the machine

[Song 106: One Night a Day]
2 ContributorsOne Night a Day Lyrics
There's not a lot of things to do
I wouldn't rather do with you
Guess I'm funny that way

Lately I just sit and stare
I talk to people who aren't there
To get through one night a day

One night a day, one step away
From leavin' you behind

I sit up with the radio
Sing along with the ones I know
To get through one night a day


I'm callin' every friend I've had
I wake 'em up and make 'em mad
To let 'em know that I'm OK

I used to sit and talk to you
But they're all just a substitute
To get through one night a day

One night a day, one step away
From leavin' you behind

I stay up with the late, late show
Just another way I know
To get through one night a day

To get through one night a day

[Song 107: Kickin’ and Screamin’]
2 ContributorsKickin’ and Screamin’ Lyrics
Well, I don't know what my uncle did, but he must have done it right
They sure strung him up one Saturday night
He had spent his whole life fussin', would've spent his last breath cussin'
'Til he realized the deal was really done
He started screamin', "Hallelujah", tryin' to make his peace with everyone

Yeah, he was kickin' and a-screamin'
Just like he came in
He was kickin' and a-screamin', darlin'
Right to the bitter end
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup
And go out hollerin', "Whoa!"
Lord, we never want to be here
Sure don't ever want to go
Now take me for example

Well, I could hear those church bells ringin', to my best friend I was clingin'
Screamin', "If you love me, brother, don't let me go"
Well then the whole scene was repeated, two years later I begged and pleaded
Screamin', "If you love me, honey, now you know you wouldn't want to let me go"
No, I didn't want to do it, but I sure don't want to see it come undone

Yeah, I was kickin' and a-screamin'
Just like I came in
Whoa, I was kickin' and a-screamin', baby
Right to the bitter end
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup
And go out hollerin', "Whoa!"
Lord, we never want to be here
Sure don't ever want to go


Yeah, I was kickin' and a-screamin'
Just like I came in
Yeah, I was kickin' and a-screamin', darlin'
Right to the bitter end
Ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup
And go out hollerin', "Whoa!"
Seems we never want to be here
Sure don't ever want to go

Naw, we never want to be here
Sure don't ever want to go

[Song 108: Same Old Story]
4 ContributorsSame Old Story Lyrics
While they dance, how she holds him
Pulls him close and loves him so
While he dreams of another
And counts the days until he lets her go

Same old story
That everybody knows
It's one heart holdin' on
And one letting go

While they write, Lord, he tells her
How they two will settle down
But she only hears the highway
And a voice in some other town

And the harder he holds her
The more she slips away

Same old story
That everybody knows
It's one heart holdin' on
And one letting go

Same old story

[Song 109: Midnight Sun]
2 ContributorsMidnight Sun Lyrics
Ain't no hay left on the ground
Going to join the sun in sitting down
My last bale and well my tail is dragging
Cotton shirt, Cotton mouth
Cold ones waiting at the house
It's time for me to get down off the wagon

Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
A jukebox and swinging doors
Soft and pretties on a hardwood floor
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun

Find a looker, have her hold my keys
And tell her later we'll be needing these
Grab a cold one, turn it upside down
To that honky tonking sound

Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
Because eight o' clock comes twice a day
And either way you'll find me chasing strays
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun

Shoot the breeze while shooting pool
Dance 'til you're sweating like a rented mule
Getting loud with all my cowboy friends
The party never ends

Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
Looky there who waits for me
Smiling sweetly, holding up my keys
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun

In the land of the midnight sun

[Song 110: How You Ever Gonna Know]
2 ContributorsHow You Ever Gonna Know Lyrics
That old wind that's whippin' out there
It's whistlin' your tune
That wind blew pyramids to Egypt
And footprints to the moon
And that old star that you've been wishin' on
Is shinin' mighty bright
But it's the fire inside your heart
That's gonna lead you to the light

How you ever gonna know
What it's like to live there
How you ever gonna know
Victory
How you ever gonna know
What it's like when dreams become reality
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to hold her
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to dance
How you ever gonna know
If you never take a chance

You know failure isn't failure
If a lesson from it's learned
I guess love would not be love
Without a risk of bein' burned
Anything in life worth havin'
Lord, it has its sacrifice
But the gift that you're receivin'
Is worth more than a price

How you ever gonna know
What it's like to live there
How you ever gonna know
What you never knew
How you ever gonna know
If you're down here doin' what the good Lord put you here to do
How you ever gonna know
If you could have done it
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to fly
How you ever gonna know
If you never dare to try

Listen not to the critics
Who put their own dreams on the shelf
If you want to get the truth to admit it
You gotta find out for yourself

How you ever gonna know
What it's like to be there
How you ever gonna know
If you're the best
How you ever gonna know
What you believe in if you don't put it to the test
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to hold him
How you ever gonna know
What livin' means
How you ever gonna know
If you never chase the dreams

How you ever gonna know
Your potential
How you ever gonna know
Victory
How you ever gonna know
What it's like when dreams become reality
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to hold him
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to dance
How you ever gonna know
If you never take a chance

Tell me, how you're gonna know
What it's like to live there

[Song 111: Thicker Than Blood]
2 ContributorsThicker Than Blood Lyrics
She was born in Kansas City
Raised in Arkansas
Fell in love with an ex-Marine
She already had three babies
He had one of his own
They came together
For another and me
Our family never shared
The same last name
But our family
Was a family, the same
(And they say)
Blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love is
Thicker than blood

Wreck out on the highway
Rain falling down
Lord, he must have
Fell asleep at the wheel
There's a number of people
Just standing around
Lord, I can't condemn
The fear that they feel

For that river of red
Could be the death of me
God, give me strength
And keep reminding me
That blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love is
Thicker than blood

And if blood is
Thicker than water
Then what are we fighting for?
We're all sons and daughters
Of something that
Means so much more

I see it on my TV
But I can't understand
Lord, it's one
Big contradiction to me
How in god's name
We love thy neighbor with fists
In our hands
And kill each other
When we just don't agree

Why can't we see the walls
We can't see through?
And see what God's
Been telling me and you
(And that is)
Blood is thicker than water
Oh, but love
Love is thicker than blood

Somedays won't end ever and somedays pass on by
I'll be working here forever, at least until I die
Dammed if you do, dammed if you don't
I'm supposed to get a raise week, you know damn well I won't

Working for a living
Working for a living, living and working
I'm taking what they giving because I'm working for a living

Hey I'm not complaining because I really need the work
Hitting up my buddy's got me feeling like a jerk
Car payment, insurance,alimony, rent
I get a check on Friday, but it's all ready spent

Oh, Working for a living
Oh, taking what they giving
Oh, Working for a living
Oh, ooh

Bus boy, bartender, ladies of the night
Grease monkey, ex-junky, winner of the fight
Walking on the streets its really all the same Nascar,Rock star, any other day

[Song 113: Mary Had A Little Lamb]
3 ContributorsMary Had A Little Lamb Lyrics
Mary had a little lamb
One holy morning
Neath the star of Bethlehem
A brand new day was forming
Guided by the shining light
And the angel's voice
Wise men traveled through the night
To see the baby boy

Because Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God

They gathered around to see the lamb
In the manger sleeping
Such a humble throne for Him
The promise God was keeping
There the shepards bowed their heads
Among the cattle lowing
The first ever Christmas gift
Was wrapped in swaddling clothes

Mary had a little lamb
King of kings and son of man
Mary had a little lamb of God

For the world a sacrifice
Mary did give birth
The way she held him in her arms
Is how He holds the earth

4 ContributorsIt’s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year Lyrics
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle-belling
And everyone telling you
Be of good cheer
It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And great happy meetings
When friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for roasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoe-ing
And hearts will be glowing
When loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year

[Song 115: I’d Rather Have Nothing]
2 ContributorsI’d Rather Have Nothing Lyrics
I jumped in the truck and headed for Kansas
Morning found me in Port Aranas
Sipping on rum in that warm Texas sun
I've never been good at keeping directions
And I believe schedules are one of life's worst infections
And I got to be free 'cause I'd rather nothing
Than a whole lot of something I don't need

Yeah I'd rather have nothing
Than a whole lot of something
That don't fit the life that I lead
Material things and all that wealth brings
Just must be for some other breed
Because life ain't about the worries and doubts
That comes with the lust and the greed
Yeah and I'd rather have nothing
That a whole lot of something we don't need

I spent that evening in a tavern in town
With a bunch of my new friends my money brought around
And I told them about you
And all the hell we'd been through

Everyone there had a similar story
Years for the tears with all the heartache and worry
And we all agreed that we'd rather have nothing
Than a whole lot of something we don't need

Yeah I'd rather have nothing
Than a whole lot of something
That don't fit the life that I lead
Commintments and strings and all that love brings
Just must be for some other breed
Because life ain't about the worries and doubts
That comes with the lust and the greed
Yeah and I'd rather have nothing
Than a whole lot of something I don't need

Oh, I'd rather have nothing
Than a whole lot of something I don't need

You call me cryin' on the phone at 2 AM
And I rush right over
You talked to me like you never talk to him
And I just don't understand

You hold me like you're scared to let me go
You look at me like I'm invisible

And I don't know why
I'm out of my mind
I'm stuck in the rain, standin' in line
Watchin' your world go by
And I can't believe
That I'm crashin' and burnin'
And somehow you can't see
I love the way you wreck me

Tell me what I gotta do to paint me in
Your perfect picture
My heart's runnin' in a race I can't win
And I just can't help myself

I wanna write it on the wall for you to see
Would it matter if I got down on my knees?

And I don't know why
I'm out of my mind
I'm stuck in the rain, standin' in line
Watchin' your world go by
And I can't believe
That I'm crashin' and burnin'
And somehow you can't see
I love the way you wreck me

You've already got the best of me
You've already made a mess of me
And I keep comin' back, comin' back for more

And I don't know why
I'm out of my mind
I'm stuck in the rain, standin' in line
Watchin' your world go by
And I can't believe
That I'm crashin' and burnin' and tossin' and turnin'
I guess I've learned
That you're never gonna see
I love the way you wreck me
I love the way you wreck me

[Song 117: Allison Miranda]
4 ContributorsAllison Miranda Lyrics
On a two lane north of Casper
Is where this all begins
Heading back to Oklahoma
For a week to visit friends
She was walking along the highway
So I pulled off to the side
And asked her if she needed a ride
We tor up that ole blacktop
Until we found I-25
And just into Colorado
She asked if she could drive
I'd never met nobody like her
I'd never laughed so much
And I grew hungry for her touch

I used to think of autumn
As sweaters and leaves
And I used to think the night
Was just for dreamers and thieves
But that was before she came
Allison Miranda was her name

By the time that we hit Kansas
We both felt pretty beat
So we found ourselves a motel
And grabbed a bite to eat
We'd rest a few short hours
Soon we'd be out of there
Three days later we came up for air

I used to think of autumn
As sweaters and leaves
And I used to think the night
Was just for dreamers and thieves
But that was before she came
Allison Miranda was her name

Now I can't forget
The morning when I woke alone in bed
To a rose left on her pillow
And a goodbye note that read
You cannot grow a flower
If you do not have the seed
Now I've got everything I need

I used to think of autumn
As sweaters and leaves
And I used to think the night
Was just for dreamers and thieves
But that was before she came
Allison Miranda was her name

[Song 118: Pushing Up Daisies]
3 ContributorsPushing Up Daisies Lyrics
Sometimes I tell you the way that I feel
I swear that I'm going crazy
Keep telling myself it ain't that big a deal
It's better than pushing up daisies
I felt the arrow from death's fatal quiver
Come so close it actually grazed me
I bled the blood and I felt the cold shiver
God only knows how He saved me

There's two dates in time that they'll carve on your stone
And everyone knows what they mean
What's more important is the time that is known
In that little dash there in between
That little dash there in between

Sometimes my heart is as true as a dove
Sometimes my heart it betrays me
So I draw my sword for to fight for my love
But without a whisper she slays me

My mother died but somehow she keeps living
She'll never cease to amaze me
Now Dad turns his back on each day that he's given
Because he'd rather be pushing up daisies

There's two dates in time that they'll carve on your stone
And everyone knows what they mean
What's more important is the time that is known
In that little dash there in between
Yeah, that little dash there in between

Honey, I know
You got a good job
You're out there
Making all that dough
They keep you late
Working that overtime
And I don't ever
See you no more
I guess you're not
Checking your message machine
Seems like you're never in
But I've got a hunch
If we can just do lunch
I could get your attention again

Whoever said
It's a man's world
Don't know what
He's talking about
You've got me working
Around the clock
Honey, trying to figure you out
I know time is money
But there's more to life honey
Than how much you can spend
You've got to make a little time
For the good times
Honey, can you squeeze me in?

On the calendar, baby
You told me that
Tonight's the night
I've got the champagne chilled
I've got a gourmet meal

I try to get you on the phone
I get stuck on hold
I guess you keep getting sidetracked
I've been faxing you
Love notes all day long
But you don't ever fax me back

1 ContributorNobody Gets Off in This Town Lyrics
Nobody gets off in this town
Trains don't even slow down
My high school sweetheart's married and gone
They met on a bus to San Antone
The Greyhound stops an' somebody gets on
But nobody gets off in this town

Nobody gets off in this town
Old folks 'round here wear a frown
Now let me see if I can set the scene
It's a one-dog town and he's old and mean
There's one stop light but it's always green
Nobody gets off in this town

Nobody gets off in this town
High school colors are brown
They can't drag Main because it kicks up dust
Their cars and their dreams are all startin' to rust
The high school dances are always a bust
Nobody gets off in this town


Nobody gets off in this town
They oughta just tear it down
'Cause in the winter you freeze and in the summer you fry
Utility bill's the only thing that gets high
I'd go for a drink but this county is dry
Nobody gets off... nobody gets off... nobody gets off in this square old merry-go-round
No, nobody gets off in this town

Out in the starlight, just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

I stop to see a weeping willow, cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy, night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight, just a-hopin' you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me

Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me

I go out walkin' after midnight

There's a girl in the kitchen, and she's wearing my shirt
My buddies are home again, they're threatening to leave
Yes that beer on my nightstand will be breakfast for me

Cause that's how it goes with cowboys and friends
As soon as it's over, it all starts again
That's the way that it should be
Cause that's the way that it's been
Yeah the fun never ends, when the party begins
Cowboys and friends
I've been working all morning, just busting my back
And it's all for a foreman who doesn't know jack
My buddies keep talking, they say we're going out late
Guess that sleep that I'm wanting will just have to wait

Cause that's how it goes with cowboys and friends
As soon as it's over, it all starts again
That's the way that it should be

Yeah the fun never ends, when the party begins
Cowboys and friends

Yeah the party begins where this two lane road ends

But there's so much that you'll never know

[Song 124: The Road I’m On]
3 ContributorsThe Road I’m On Lyrics
The hummin' of this bluebird is somethin' I've been missin'
And the rhythm of the steel belts to the rockin' of the engine
My ears are still ringin' and I can still hear 'em singin' in the neon
Yeah, it don't get no better than this road I'm on

That old white line is crooked as were rollin' down this highway
The windmills to the cotton fields, it's all goin' my way
Each town is a new name, each night is a home game, united by the love for a song
No, it don't get no better than this road I'm on

From the honky-tonks to the big stage, I've played 'em the same way
And I'm left to stand where I stand
All of the places and all of the faces
Who make me who I am
Thanks for makin' me feel like bein' home
On this road I'm on

Oh, they travel crazy miles,and God knows what they go through
Just to see you smile, let you know they love you
And I pray it's forever that we're all together, in this life I've seen it all
'Cause there ain't nothin' better, than this road I'm on


From the honky-tonks to the big stage, I've played 'em the same way
And I'm left to stand where I stand
All of the places and all of the faces
Who make me who I am
Thanks for makin' me feel like bein' home
On this road I'm on

I've got to tell you, it's good to be home
On this road I'm on
On this road I'm on

[Song 125: Baby Jesus Is Born]
4 ContributorsBaby Jesus Is Born Lyrics
Tell the children of Abraham
There's a star over Bethlehem
And the light in the manger
Come-a Christmas mornin'
Baby Jesus is born

Angel came to Mary
Said, I'm telling you
The light of this world
Is shining inside of you
His sweet forgiveness
Gonna set men free
The lame will walk
And the blind will see

Tell the children of Abraham
There's a star over Bethlehem
And the light in the manger
Come-a Christmas mornin'
Baby Jesus is born
Baby Jesus is born

Wise men following a holy light
Shepherds heard singing
In the midnight sky
And they all come-a running
Through the stable door
The meek and the mighty
The rich and the poor

Tell the children of Abraham
There's a star over Bethlehem
And the light in the manger
Come-a Christmas mornin'
Baby Jesus is born
Baby Jesus is born

Tell the children of Abraham
There's a star over Bethlehem
And the light in the manger
Come-a Christmas mornin'
Baby Jesus is born
Baby Jesus is born

Tell the children of Abraham
There's a star over Bethlehem
And the light in the manger
Come-a Christmas mornin'
Baby Jesus is born
Baby Jesus is born

Tell the children of Abraham
There's a star over Bethlehem
And the light in the manger
Come-a Christmas mornin'
Baby Jesus is born
Baby Jesus is born

Tell the children of Abraham
There's a star over Bethlehem
And the light in the manger
Come-a Christmas mornin'
Baby Jesus is born
Baby Jesus is born
Baby Jesus is
Baby Jesus is born

[Song 126: Face to Face]
2 ContributorsFace to Face Lyrics
There was a bad boy in the school yard
That waited on you every day
Seemed like every time you turned around
Well, he was standin' in your way
Well, he broke your glasses, the girls all laughed
As he pushed you to the floor
Until then you stood up one day knowin'
You couldn't stand it anymore

And your gentle hand was finally clenched in rage
And you were face to face

Face to face, with the devil that you've been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was, well, now brother wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face

Your date showed up with flowers
And you thought your prayers had come
But with every passing hour
You watched it come undone
Then the night exploded and you begged him no
But he forever changed your life
And now he waits a judge and jury
Thinkin' you'll break down inside

And with a finger, you can put his fists away
And you're face to face

Face to face, with the devil that you've been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was, well, now sister wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face

'Cause it'll never go away
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced

Drivin' by the graveyard
On a wicked winter's eve
And you're wonderin' why a man of faith
Is whistlin' nervously
Then you stop the car and you hold your heart
'Cause you finally realize
Hell, the devil ain't in the darkness
He's a-rattlin' 'round inside

And with folded hands, you truly start to pray
'Cause you're face to face

Face to face, with the devil that you'd been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was, well, now brother wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face

'Cause it'll never go away
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced
Face to face
Face to face

[Song 127: Do What You Gotta Do]
2 ContributorsDo What You Gotta Do Lyrics
Sometimes you've got to take the heat
If you're going to walk down on the mean street
Take the heat and you see it through
Because sometimes it comes down to
Do what you got to

Sometimes it goes right down to the wire
And you might have to walk through the fire
Walk on, boy all the way through
Sometimes it just comes down to
Do what you got to do

Well, there's people that'll tell you
It's just no use
And there's people that'll tell you
That you're going to lose
People that'll tell you
Anything you're going to listen to
Do what you got to do

Someday they're going to call your name
They'll come looking for some one to blame
What's your name, boy
Hey, you just tell them true
Because they can't take the truth from you
So do what you got to do

Well, they'll call you a hero or a traitor
But you'll find out that, sooner or later
Nobody in this world is going to do it for you
Do what you got to do

There is nobody in this world
That's going to do it for you
Do what you got to do

[Song 128: This Ain’t Tennessee]
2 ContributorsThis Ain’t Tennessee Lyrics
It's a big estate, with wrought iron gates
And palm trees standin' tall
And fancy mirrors and chandeliers
And comfort wall to wall
And the ocean air is so crisp and clear
And they rave about our view
But there ain't no mountain breeze
And there ain't no hickory trees

And this ain't Tennessee
And she ain't you

There's a bedroom suite where she comes to me
And as her fingers touch my face
I close my eyes and I fantasize
Of another time and place
What she feels is so warm and real
And I know her love is true
And she tries so hard to please
Still I think sometimes she sees

That this ain't Tennessee
And she ain't you

It's not that it's not grand enough
And it's not that I'm not man enough
There's just somethin' easy goin' that I love
'Bout you and Tennessee

So, I made up my mind to learn my lines
And try to play the part
But part of me's in Tennessee
And deep down in my heart
I miss my Smoky Mountain home
And I miss your lovin' too
And it's deep inside of me
And it's always gonna be

'Cause this ain't Tennessee
And she ain't you

Wake up, I wanna take you out there
Let's go, wherever it's the weekend
'Cause, Lord knows, this world needs to unwind
So, let's show 'em how to have a good time
Let go baby, it's the weekend
From western Montana to south Louisiana
I even hear the doors are now open in Havana
It's the weekend all over the world
You know, they're snakin' the cabanas down in Savannah
I bet they're all laughing and loving in Vienna
It's the weekend all over the world
So, jump in, to good times and good love
With good friends you just can't get enough of
We're all in, baby, it's the weekend
You know, you're rocking in Atlanta, dancing in Guyana
I swear, I hear 'em singing in sweet home Alabama
It's the weekend all over the world
They're on the track in Indiana, they're chantin' in Siena
Here we are, you and me still in our pajamas
It's the weekend all over the world, weekend all over the world
Weekend all over the world

You know they're rockin' in Atlanta
Rollin' in Havana

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
Because no matter how far away your roam
If you long for the sunshine and a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home
I met a man who lived in Tennessee
And he was looking for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
Now in Pennsylvania folks are traveling
Down to Dixie's sunny shore
The Atlantic to Pacific
Oh, the season is terrific
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home

[Song 131: Fish]
2 ContributorsFish Lyrics
I took a short vacation to the Gulf of Mexico
Everyday I’d see this fellow with his tackle box and pole
And he’d fish, and he’d fish
All day long

So one day I went out walkin' and when I got down to his spot
Me and him, we got to talkin', he said have you ever thought
About what you are gonna do
With your life

I said I’m about to share with you my secret to success
So you can go make somethin' of yourself

You can sell these fish you’re catchin', you can buy yourself a boat
Hard work and dedication and the next thing you know
You reinvest your money you’ll be captain of the fleet
You’ll be sittin' pretty down on Easy Street

And you can do anything that you wish
He says, you mean fish?

His simple words of wisdom hit me right between the eyes
And it really got me thinkin', about the way I live my life
'Cause I just work and I work
All day long

So I asked myself a question that I knew the answer to
Is success a second mortgage on a big house with a pool
Or is it a chair, the salt in the air
Wettin' the line

That advice that I tried to give him to take him to the top
Was really nothin' more than just a crock

You can sell these fish you’re catchin', you can buy yourself a boat
Hard work and dedication and the next thing you know
You reinvest your money you’ll be captain of the fleet
You’ll be sittin' pretty down on Easy Street

And you can do anything that you wish
He says, you mean fish?

So I went and bought some tackle and a bucket full of bait
You can find me here most every day
With my chair sitting there next to his
We just fish

Yeah, we just fish
Yeah fish, fish, fish, fish, fish

1 ContributorI’ve Got a Good Thing Going Lyrics
She swears there's nothin' wrong, but somethin's missin'
She's never been much good at tellin' lies
'Cause you can hear the sounds of leavin', if you listen
This may be California, but Oklahoma's in her eyes

And I've got a good thing goin'
It's plain to see she's tired of hangin' on
Yes, I've got a good thing goin'
And it's killin' me that she's as good as gone

By now she must be tired of always givin'
And tired of what she's gettin' in return
I guess Oklahoma's more her style of livin'
'Cause I can see her heart is headin' across a bridge I thought she'd burned

And I've got a good thing goin'
It's plain to see she's tired of hangin' on
Yes, I've got a good thing goin'
And it's killin' me that she's as good as gone

Lord, it's killin' me that she's as good as gone

Somebody needed me
Needed me to open up a door closed before
That's what I'm here for
Now could you help me
Find my way back home?

So, leave a light on
Leave a light on for me
And I will shine
And maybe then I could see
You are my destiny
You and I
Keepin' love alive 'til the last tear is cried

For all time
You're a friend of mine
And I want to thank you
I thank you for always bein' there
Anywhere
Where only fools would dare
And now here I am my friend
Reachin' out my hand needing you again

To leave a light on
Leave a light on for me
So, I will shine
And maybe then I could see
That you are my destiny
You and I
Keepin' love alive 'til the last tear is cried


So, leave a light on
Leave a light on for me

Keepin' love alive 'til the last tear is cried

I need nursin' cause I'm hurtin' from a long week workin' and I'm thirstin' for a remedy
I need a redhead, brunette, or blonde angel of mercy that'll put me in intensive care
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
Hang on, don't hang up on me lady, gotta take me to the promised land
'Cause I'm dying to see something like a juke joint jumpin' to a thumpin' little five-piece band
And be it red dirt, swing, just anything that's country, even karaoke I don't care
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk and girl you gotta get me there
I've tried my phone app road maps, Siri, where's the party at, but that ain't got me anywhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
Last call, that's all operator, I'm afraid we're running out of time
I know I sound broken but I just keep hoping for an open glowing neon sign
And maybe this is crazy, but I'm thinking baby, maybe later you can meet me there
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk and girl you gotta get me there
I've tried my phone app road maps, Siri, where's the party at, but that ain't got me anywhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere (out there)
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere

[Song 135: Why Ain’t I Running]
2 ContributorsWhy Ain’t I Running Lyrics
I can hear
That highway calling
As I watch the sunrise
Crawling across her shoulder
This is usually goodbye
And yet those words
I just can't find here
As I hold her
She's like no other woman
That I have known before
And it ain't me to
See the morning sun
From this side of the door

Why ain't I running?
Why ain't I gone?
How does she hold me
Without holding on?
In love or a fight
She's stronger than strong
Something's not right
If there ain't nothing wrong
It's got me wondering
Why ain't I running?
Why ain't I gona?

All those words
I left behind me
Praying they would never
Find me and my freedom
But if they stood
Right here beside me
They would never recognise me
For all that she's done

Once happiness was only
Whenever I was on my own
So now why do I feel lonely
Any time that I'm alone


No, they've never built
A wall that high
Or made a chain that strong
And God ain't never
Made a place
I felt like I belong

[Song 136: Go Tell It on the Mountain]
5 ContributorsGo Tell It on the Mountain Lyrics
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and far away
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

The shepherds all were watching
Over their sheep at night
When a guiding star shone from heaven
And they followed that holy light

Everybody, go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

They found a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent out salvation
On that blessed Christmas morn

Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

He brought with Him forgiveness
He lived to show us the way
He came to redeem all creation
And to wash all our sins away

Hallelujah, go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Go tell it, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

[Song 137: Where the Cross Don’t Burn]
3 ContributorsWhere the Cross Don’t Burn Lyrics
We were white and they were black
And our lives, they were divided by the railroad tracks
But we'd meet up every mornin' at that river bend
It's where I learned about Jesus from my only black friend
And sometimes we'd sit and stare up at the sky
I could see the hope of heaven in his eyes

In the land where the cotton grows
In a time when change camе slow
Just beyond the point of no return
A whitе boy and a black old man
On the tracks walkin' hand in hand
That's where I come to understand and learn
Where the cross don't burn

He'd tell me, "Money doesn't matter, nor the color of your skin
You can stumble, even fall, and still get up again
'Cause it ain't about the deeds, good or bad that we have done
All we have to do is love to be disciples of the Son"
And we'd join hands and bow our heads to pray
And he told me that he loved me every day

In the land where the cotton grows
In a time when change came slow
Just beyond the point of no return
A white boy and a black old man
On the tracks walkin' hand in hand
That's where I come to understand and learn
Where the cross don't burn

Yeah, we're all gathered here this mornin' at this river bend
To say our last goodbyes to my very best friend
As his ashes slowly float away
We know it's only 'til we meet again someday

In the land where the cotton grows
In a time when change came slow
Just beyond the point of no return
A young boy and a kind old man
On the tracks walkin' hand in hand
That's where I come to understand and learn
Where the cross don't burn

Clyde was a dealer who was gifted with the sleight of hand
Bang! Bang!  Bang! Bang!
Their petty thieving and conniving ways
Would never get 'em to that beach house of their dreams someday
Bang! Bang!  Bang! Bang!
But every afternoon at four that armored car rolled to the door (like before)
Bang! Bang!
The doors swing open and the pick-up begins
Bang! Bang!
The guard knocks, she lets him in
Bang! Bang!
Two bangs of cash hit the floor
The guard asks her out, she turns him down and shows him the door (once more)
Bang! Bang!  Bang! Bang!
They must have run through it a thousand times
But something happened on the evening of their perfect crime
Bang! Bang!  Bang! Bang!
It seems the set up and the switch all play
But there's a problem when it gets down to the get away
Bang! Bang!  Bang! Bang!
So, to complete their master plan
They're gonna need a pick-up man (meet Jo-Ann)

Bang! Bang! Bang!
It's four on Monday and the hustle begins
Bang! Bang! Bang!
The guard knocks, she lets him in
Bang! Bang! Bang!
The bags of cash hit the floor
Clyde's hiding out, he swaps 'em out
The guard's out the door (they score)
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Two big bags of money and they're both feeling light
She sees the guard is stopping, she knows when something's not right
When he turns to find he's standing face to face now with her
She says "how 'bout dinner Friday
And if you're good I'll let you have dessert"
Bang! Bang!
The guard is happy and he's gone in a flash
Bang! Bang!
She grabs Clyde and the cash
Bang! Bang!
They see Jo-Ann and jump in
They were last seen heading West and never heard from again
The end
Bang! Bang!
Amen
Bang! Bang!

Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney, so mama must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him

They thought I was fast a-sleepin', they thought that I was tucked in bed
They never figured I'd come a-peeping or that I'd hear what was said
Santa put his arm around mama and mama put her arm around him
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy, well, then I'm a-gonna tell on them

Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney, so mama must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him

I never saw Dancer or Prancer, I never heard the sleigh bells ring
I never saw a red-nosed reindeer like they show on the TV screen
But he sure brought lots of presents, so Santa Claus he must have been
Well, he sure looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him

Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney, so mama must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him

Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney, so mama must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him

1 ContributorFor a Minute There Lyrics
We were walking along the ocean
Together hand in hand
When I stopped to write "I Love You" in the sand
And when I looked up you were standing
Ten miles out at sea
And in a sweat
I woke up from that crazy dream
As I reached to hold you in the morning light
It was your pillow
I clung to so tight

But for a minute there
Well I thought it was you
For a minute there
My prayers had come true
And for a minute there
I began again to live
What I wouldn't give
For just a minute there

Five o'clock on Friday
Sitting at a light
When this angel walked right by me
On my right
And the cars all started honking
As my feet hit the ground
And though I chased and called
You never turned around
Oh the walk, the hair, the perfume
Were the same
How I wished she would've answered
To your name

Cause for a minute there
Well I thought it was you
Yes for a minute there, I swear
My prayers had come true
Yes for a minute there
I began again to live
What I wouldn't give
For just a minute there

Tonight the stars in heaven
Are bright as they can be
And I swear one of them
Is winking down at me

And for a minute there
Well I thought it was you
Yes for a minute there, I swear
My prayers had come true
Yes for a minute there
I began again to live
What I wouldn't give
For just a minute there

Oh what I wouldn't give
How I'd love to live
For just a minute there

Missing you like the way that I do
You were right about so many things
That I’m starting to think I was wrong about you
You were right about me crying all night hoping
My heart breaking in two
You were right about so many things
That I’m starting to think I was wrong about you
If I could do it all over again
I’d do it all a little differently
Slower than that
And I might be able to see
That you were right about me wanting you back again
As soon as I said we were through
You were right about so many things
That I’m starting to think I was wrong about you
If I could do it all over again
I’d do it all a little differently
Slower than that
And I might be able to see
That you were right about our hearts beating as one heart
And me not having a clue
You were right about so many things
That it makes me think that I was wrong about you
You were right about so many things
I’m starting to think I was wrong about you

[Song 142: Unto You This Night]
4 ContributorsUnto You This Night Lyrics
On a night so long ago, by the light of one bright star
Two weary travelers far from Galilee
Took refuge in a stable where a little child was born
To bring the gift of love to you and me

When the angels told the shepherds of His birth
There came a great rejoicing on the earth

And they sang "Glory to God in the highest"
Dawning that first Christmas morn'
"Peace on earth and tidings of great joy
For unto you this night a child is born"

And lo these many years since then, that ancient star still guides us
And now again our Christmas voices ring
Blessed we are and safe at home with loved ones here beside us
And in the still and silent night we sing

How the angels told the shepherds of His birth
And there came a great rejoicing on the earth

And they sang "Glory to God in the highest"
Dawning that first Christmas morn'
"Peace on earth and tidings of great joy
For unto you this night a child is born"

And they sang "Glory to God in the highest"
Dawning that first Christmas morn'
"Peace on earth and tidings of great joy
For unto you this night a child is born"

Maybe it's the bible, or could it be the lack

Maybe it's the daughters, maybe it's the sons
Maybe it's the brothers of the mothers or the guns

[Song 145: Cowboy Cadillac]
2 ContributorsCowboy Cadillac Lyrics
I've never know one better, she's a real go getter
If you met her you'd be good as gone
She's a real red liner, likes it all behind her
She's the kind that keeps you hangin' on
She's a cowboy's buddy, even when she gets muddy
Lord, she's lovely from her front to back
So, either comin' or a-goin', know her best sides showin'
She's my cowboy Cadillac

She's the perfect picture of the perfect mixture
'Tween a woman and fine machine
She's a hard work lover, a real tough mother
She's the cover of a magazine
And I'm happy knowin' that what keeps me goin'
Is what's gonna keep me comin' back
She's my honkin', tonkin', everything I'm wantin'
Cowboy Cadillac

She loves to haul them cattle, all my ropes and saddle
And it doesn't matter work or play
If it's a mountain she can crawl it, if it's hay then she can haul it
She's the last one to call it a day
Every cowboy loves her, Lord, they all dream of her
Oh, brother, don't they all react
At the end of the evenin' when they see my leavin'
With my cowboy Cadillac

She's the perfect picture of the perfect mixture
'Tween a woman and fine machine
She's a hard work lover, a real tough mother
She's the cover of a magazine
And I'm happy knowin' that what keeps me goin'
Is what's gonna keep me comin' back
She's my honkin', tonkin', everything I'm wantin'
Cowboy Cadillac

She's my honkin', tonkin', anything I'm wantin'
Cowboy Cadillac

[Song 146: Please Operator (Could You Trace This Call)]
2 ContributorsPlease Operator (Could You Trace This Call) LyricsPlease operator
Could you trace this call
Find out where I'm drinking
Which dirty beer hall
And send a cab driver to call for me here
No need to describe me
Because I am not all here
She told me to get lost and that's what I did
But I've done it so well, I don't know where I hid
And she swore she'll never see me again
Hell, I'll never find me in the shape that I'm in
Please operator
Could you trace this call
Find out where I'm drinkin'
Which dirty beer hall
And send a cab driver to call for me here
No need to describe me
'Cause I ain't all here
Now I had to ask myself if I were me
If I was out drinkin', just where would I be
Then I thumbnailed a label and there I appeared
Hidin' out in the bottle behind a three-day-old beard

Please operator
Could you trace this call
Find out where I'm drinkin'
Which dirty beer hall
And send a cab driver to call for me here
No need to describe me
'Cause I ain't all here
Now I may be lonely but I'm never alone
'Cause I've been beside myself since she's been gone
Please operator
Could you trace this call
Find out where I'm drinkin'
Which dirty beer hall
And send a cab driver to call for me here
And if he could fine me, ill buy him a beer
Please operator
Could you trace this call
Find out where I'm drinkin'
Which dirty beer hall
And send a cab driver to call for me here
Ill be beside myself to pour him a beer
Please operator
Could you trace this call
Find out where I'm drinkin'
Which dirty beer hall

[Song 147: Driftin’ Away]
2 ContributorsDriftin’ Away Lyrics
With all of my heart, I know I could love you
But, with all of my soul, I'm drifting away
With all of my mind, I know you could save me
From myself and anything else
With all of my strength, I want to reach out for you
With every breath, I call out your name
With every step, I just want to turn around and say
Baby make it okay

But I'm so afraid that you've forgiven
Me one too many times
And I'm so afraid to give my heart again
Just to have a change of mind

And I'm not quite sure that you can trust me
And I would hate to have you find me again
Baby, like the wind, drifting away
It blows and nobody knows where it's going to
(I'm drifting away)
It blows and nobody know what it's going to do

With all of my heart
I know I disappointed you
And although I'm real sorry
I don't know how to save this time
But, if I would lose you
I know I would go completely
Out of my mind
I'm running out of time

And I'm so afraid that you've forgiven
One too many times
And I'm so afraid to give my heart again
Just to have a change of mind


At night you can hear it cry
As the tear drops fall from heaven's eyes
(Falling down)
And somehow you know it's true
These tears that fall, they're falling for you
(Falling for you)
It blows and nobody knows where's it going to
(Falling down)
It blows and nobody knows what it's going to do

Oh, at night, at night
At night you can hear it cry
As the tear drops fall from heaven's eyes
And somehow you know it's true
These tears that fall

[Song 148: Pure Adrenaline]
1 ContributorPure Adrenaline LyricsThere's a storm that is coming
Everyone is running away
But you hear a different drummer drumming
You’ve waited your whole life for this one day
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Time to unleash the beast inside
Time to show the world what you are all about
Now, it's kickin’ in, pure adrenaline
No one's ever been where you're standin'
Of the multitudes, God has chosen you
Time to dial it in, pure adrenaline
There’s a long stretch of highway
And you know that’s where they’re makin‘ their move
You could pass on some forgotten byway
But you’re young and you've got something to prove
Don't want to run, don’t want to hide
Time to unleash the beast inside
Time to show them all what you are all about
Now, it's kickin’ in, pure adrenaline
No one’s ever been where you're standin'
Of the multitudes God has chosen you
Time to dial it in, pure adrenaline

Time for lift off so you better be ready to dance
Fate’s clone pissed off, gonna kill you if you give him a chance
Now, it's kickin’ in, pure adrenaline
No one’s ever been where you’re standin'
Of the multitudes God has chosen you
Time to dial it in, pure adrenaline
Pure adrenaline, pure adrenaline, pure adrenaline
Time to dial it in
Pure adrenaline

[Song 149: Rollin’]
2 ContributorsRollin’ Lyrics
She was born to a mother-trucker
Raised behind the wheel
So you can blame it on the highway
For the way she can't sit still
She said life is like a windshield
It ain't no rearview mirror
The only way to get where you're goin'
Is find that higher gear

And keep it rollin'
Life's gonna run you over if you don't get goin'
She said I want to feel the earth move under me
Movin' with the motion of a melody
Boy, I get the blues if the rhythm ain't got no soul
You gotta keep it rollin'

Well I knew that I was in trouble
When she told me that talk was cheap
Said if you're tired get on the sofa
'Cause the bed's no place to sleep
Then she reached down and she kissed me
Lord it knocked me to my knees
And I knew if I was gonna get naked
I's gonna have to roll up my sleeves

And keep it rollin'
Love was gonna run me over if I didn't get goin'
She said I want to feel the earth move under me
Movin' with the motion of a melody
Boy, I get the blues if the rhythm ain't got no soul
You got to keep it rollin'

So I talked her into gettin' married
But she wouldn't hang up her wheels
I was afraid I'd take a back seat
To the way the highway feels
But each day she's pullin' over
More than she used to
She knows love is like the highway
The main thing you gotta do

Is keep it rollin'
Life's gonna pass you by if you don't get goin'
She said I want to feel the earth move under me
Rockin' with the motion of a melody
Boy, I get the blues if the rhythm ain't got no soul
You got to keep it rollin'

Love's gonna pass you by if you don't get goin'
She said I want to feel the earth move under me
Movin' with the motion of a melody
I get the blues if the rhythm's got no soul
You got to keep it rollin'

[Song 150: Take The Keys To My Heart]
2 ContributorsTake The Keys To My Heart Lyrics
I've been out on this highway of heartache
Hoping that somewhere down the line
I could find somebody who
Could rev me like you do
So grab onto my wheel
And I'll be fine

Take the keys to my heart
And drive me crazy
I've been running on empty way too long
Honey you got the touch
That heats my motor up
Take the keys to my heart
And drive it home
Fill her up

I don't know where this road is going to lead us
But what a beautiful night for a drive
Baby put your mind at ease
Drop the top and feel the breeze
Just follow all the signs to paradise

Take the keys to my heart
And drive me crazy
I've been running on empty way too long
All that work under the hood
Sure has got it running good
Take the keys to my heart
And drive it home

Tonight we're going to set these wheels on fire
And find out just how far this thing will go
Honey we don't need no map
Because where we are is where it's at
Drop the keys to my heart
And drive it home

Baby makes my motor yearn
I long to feel that rubber burn
Take the keys to my heart
And drive it home
Drive it home
