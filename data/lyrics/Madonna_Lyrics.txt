Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me (Mmmm...)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, oh-oh-oh yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh, yeah)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, oh)

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, "Te amo"
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Te dijo, "Te amo"
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Él dijo que te ama
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
La Isla Bonita
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest
Then I have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie
But I don't let them play (No way)
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world (Material)

Living in a material world (Material)

Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe, please

Papa, don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, mm

He says that he's going to marry me
And we can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now
Is some good advice, please

Papa, don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh, ooh

Daddy, daddy if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love (In love), so, please (So)

Papa, don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh, ooh

Papa, don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach, I've been losing sleep
Papa, don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep

(Hoo!)
(Hoo!)
Come on, girls!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please

Don't go for second best, baby

Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel like I just got home

And I feel

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone, for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe

Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two, their bodies become one
I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare?

What I'm dying to say, is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now, we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss

And I'm not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe Him
God is on my side and I'll be His bride
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?
I won't give in

They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know, but we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air, it's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie
The wind that's beginning to howl?

It's a beautiful life

This type of modern life, is not for free

American life (American life)
I live the American Dream (American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American life)

I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

American life (American life)
I live the American Dream (American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American life)

Tried to be a girl
Tried to be a mess
Tried to be the best
Tried to find a friend
Tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
Fuck it

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it

I'm drinking a soy latte, I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper and I'm feeling super-duper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard of five
A gardener and a stylist, do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just livin' out the American Dream
And I just realized that nothin' is what it seems

Do I have to change my name? (American life)
Am I gonna be a star? (I live the American Dream)
Do I have to change my name? (American life)
Am I gonna be a star? (I live the American Dream)
Do I have to change my name?
(American life, I live the American Dream)
(American life, I live the American Dream)
(American life, I live the American Dream)
(American life)

[Song 23: I Don’t Give A]
45 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoI Don’t Give A Lyrics
Wake up, ex-wife
This is your life
Children, on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the Wi-Fi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweeting on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure

I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

You were so mad at me
Who's got custody?
Lawyers, suck it up
Didn't have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
Ride my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign the contract
Gotta get my money back
All the bodies have to go
Standing in the front row

I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself
And it swallowed my light
I tried to become all
That you expect of me
And if it was a failure, I don't give a
(I don't give a-a-a-a, no
I don't give a-a-a-a, no
I don't give a-a-a-a, no
I don't give a)

Shots fire
Anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire
You don't hear them bums on nothin' that's fire
Tell 'em, "Catch fire"
In the Bugatti, ten grand, one tire
Ayo Madonna (Yes, ma'am)
Mi yuh say, you original Don Dada
Inna, yah, Gabbana, in the eye of Prada
We material girls, ain't nobody hotter
Pops collar
See, I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cuttin' them checks, I was his boss
Yo, I don't give a F-U, curse nor bless you
Never let 'em stress you
Yo, I ain't a businesswoman, I'm a business, woman
And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman, yeah

I'm gonna be okay (Uh, huh)
I don't care what the people say (Madonna)
I'm gonna be alright (Nicki Minaj)
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right (Yeah)
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track? (Let's go)
I'm moving fast and I like it like that (Catch up)
I do ten things all at once (Uh, huh)
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

There's only one queen and that's Madonna
Bitch
I don't give a

Take a bow, the night is over

Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?

Watchin' you, watchin' me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)

You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?

Say goodbye (Bye-bye)

Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breakin' my heart

Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played

No more masquerade, you're one lonely star

And everyone has their part (Has their part)

It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world, they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true

And now the media's misleading us all
Turned right into wrong

So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies

I will be gay, if the gay are burned
I'll be Africa, if Africa is shut down
I will be poor, if the poor are humiliated
And I'll be a child, if the children are exploited

I know what I am
And I know what I'm not

I'll be Native Indian, if the Indian has been taken
And I'll be a woman, if she's raped and her heart is breaking

I know what I am (God knows what I am)
And I know what I'm not (And He knows what I'm not)
Do you know who you are?
Will we know when to stop?

Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
The deeper I go

"All is fair in love," she said
"Think with your heart, not with your head"
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again


Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
You've got to just let your body move to the music
You've got to just let your body go with the flow
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do

Madonna, life is so crazy
You've been through a lot
I'll tell you stories sometimes, y'know?

Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the Lower East Side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as the Northern Star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

(Talk to 'em, talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified, you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life (Music saved my life)

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (What you did?)
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as the Northern Star
I had a fire burning in my heart (Yeah)
I never gave up fighting in the dark (Let's go)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Uh) (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

In 1994, I came through the door (What?)
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers (murdered, murdered, murdered)
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowin'
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl, then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule, I'm too big to lose
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just your humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson, I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trapper (trapper), any rapper (rapper)
Any politician, beautician, or musician
Anybody, saw many bodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses, either that or jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

I was fearless like a renegade (Try to tell 'em)
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as the Northern Star
I had a fire burning in my heart (Yeah)
I never gave up fighting in the dark (Let's go)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

Cherish, cherish

So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny
I can't let go, baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please take your aim at me

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need
For two hearts that bleed
With burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

I cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

Who? You! Can't get away, I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

You're givin' it
You're givin' it to me boy
Keep giving me all-all-all your joy
Give me faith
I will always cherish you
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

Cherish (Give me faith, give me joy)

Cherish your strength (You're givin' it)

Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do you wanna go higher?

There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye

Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress

There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power

Learn to say good-bye
I yearn to say good-bye

Hey
What?
Listen

I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'Til you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me, baby, this I know

'Cause it's true love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried, oh, so many times
Those teardrops, they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember, dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you
'Cause it's true love (This time I know it's true love)
You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)
Your heart fits me like a glove (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love, it's (True love, baby)
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby

Those words whispered in your ear, I said

No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye

Don't you know, don't you know that it's

You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want
Don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes (Ooh baby)
You look a little sad, boy, I wonder why (Mmm)
I follow you around, but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say

Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key

Right up under my feet

It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat

And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire

When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey

Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

The room is spinning (Spinning)
It must be the Tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning (Sinning)
You got me in the zone
DJ, play my favorite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey

Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes

I know, I know, I know I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But I'm a bad girl anyway, hey
Forgive me

Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey

[Song 45: Crazy]
45 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoCrazy Lyrics“Crazy” is the eighth track from Madonna’s 14th studio album Madame X. The song is heavily influenced by Portuguese music: half of the chorus and bridge are sang in the Portuguese language.
I spent all night waitin' up
It's gon' be the last night I wait up for you
Spent a long time wakin' up
Used to think that I was not enough for you
Now I see that I'm just way too much
You got your hands full, I misunderstood
Now I see that I'm who I can trust
And you got a lot of wrong you're tryna make good

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

I bent my knees for you like a prayer
My God, look at me now
Peel off my weakness, layer after layer
Nothing left for me to keep 'round
I'm a force and I won't tame, babe
Can't go through this and stay the same, babe
I've seen a lot of stranger things, babe
And I'll never look at you the same

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

Eu te amo
Mas não deixo você me destruir
I put you on a pedestal, but statues, they can fall
Felt so safe, I let you drive me straight into the wall
Played the hand you dealt me, thought you felt me
Was never good at games, now I'll just forget your name
(Forget your name) Mmm

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy (Crazy)
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca (Louca)
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy

Maybe it was all too much
Too much for a man to take
Everything's bound to break
Sooner or later, sooner or later
You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I know you're scared tonight
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'll never leave your side

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold on to each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on
This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I know you're scared tonight
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'll never leave your side

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold on to each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

I know we're alright 'cause we'll never be alone
In this mad, mad, in this mad, mad world
Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold
In this mad, mad, in this mad, mad world

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around

I tried to recover my center of gravity

The thing that hurt me most

Then I went to the Far East
I tried to discover my own identity

I guess I’m lost
I paid a handsome cost
The thing that hurt the most
Was that I wasn't lost

No, I wasn't lost
It was a different feeling
A mix of lucidity and craziness
But I wasn't lost, you believe me
I was right, and I've got the right
To choose my own life like a full circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle

There's a place you gotta go
Before I let you take it all
It's like a drug, it should be illegal
Baby, you should get down low
And drink my precious alcohol
You look so thirsty, I think you need it

Kiss it better, kiss it better
Don't it taste like holy water?
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better

It's rare like mink, it's something you wanna own
(Bitch, get off my pole)

There's something you gotta hit
It's sacred and immaculate
I can let you in heaven’s door
I promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation deep within
We can do it here on the floor

Kiss it better, kiss it better

There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that I wait, the more time that I waste

I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way
I'm not afraid of what I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my own road and I can make it alone
I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my own

Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to jump

We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me
The only thing you can depend on is your family
Life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see

Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?

There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that you wait, the more time that you waste

I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my own
It sways and it swings and it bends until you make it your own

I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone (My sisters and me, my sisters and me)
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone (My sisters and me, my sisters and me)
I can make it alone
I can make it alone

Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to jump
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?

Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's okay to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting

Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
What it feels like for a girl?

Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world?

For a girl
In this world
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
What it feels like in this world?

Bring the heavens and the stars

Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one
I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins

Nothing really matters

Give me comfort in your arms

Madonna, Maluma

Bitch, I'm loca
Y yo loco, loco
Bésame la boca
¿Y tú qué me das?
Bitch, me gusta
Y yo te provoco
Mucho que me asusta
¿Por eso no te vas?

Llegó a la disco montando
Perrear con sus amigas, es lo que le gusta
Ella es la reina de su combo y nada la intimida
Es que es la más dura
Sólo utiliza Chanel
Qué bien lo combina con su joya Cartier
Dicen que su ex-novio la dejó por infiel
Le gustan menores como yo, se le ve

Mira cómo se mueve, cómo me baila
Cómo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cómo se mueve, cómo me baila y me entretiene

Bitch, I'm loca
Y yo loco, loco
Bésame la boca
¿Y tú qué me das? (Ay)
Bitch, me gusta
Y yo te provoco
Mucho que me asusta
Por eso no te vas

Quiero ser tu perra, también tu bebecita
Luego no te quejes cuando muerda esa boquita
I like to be on top, ver como te excitas
Luego no te quejes cuando muerda esa boquita (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca
Ella es mi loca, loca y yo soy loco, loco
Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca
Pero si me pide yo se lo co–, lo co–

Maybe you only had a message
That you can manage this type of entertainment
I haven't let a boy who was a bit of damage
Somehow I think you like that, I see if you can last
Forget about the future and we have no past
I like the way you move and you know you're just my type
I guess you like a crazy girl but it's alright

Mira cómo se mueve, cómo me baila
Cómo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cómo se mueve, cómo me baila y me entretiene, yeah yeah!

Bitch, I'm loca
Y yo loco, loco, loco (Tranquila)
Bésame la boca
¿Y tú qué me das? (Venga, baby)
Bitch, me gusta
Y yo te provoco
Mucho que me asusta
Por eso no te vas (Ay, ay, papi)

A long, long time ago I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in Rock 'n' roll?
And can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes (Both kicked off your shoes)
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage bronking buck
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing

Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
Well, I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
Well now, in the streets the children screamed (The children screamed)
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed (The poets dreamed)
But not a word was spoken (Not a word was spoken)
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire the most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
We started singing

Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

We started singing
We started singing
We started singing
We started singing

You can get used to the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me

You can't hurt me now

You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father, I have sinned

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?

Maybe someday
When I look back, I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

All my dreams, they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

When no one's around, then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart

Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone, you'll realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away

Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark

23 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoRebel Heart Lyrics
I live my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say, "Told you so, told you so
Why can't you be like the other girls?"
I said, "Oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever be"
Thought I belonged to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, "Oh no, I want more
That's not what I'm looking for"

So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart

I've spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say, "Look at you, look at you"
Tryin' to be so provocative
I said, "Oh, yeah, that was me
All the things I did just to be seen"
Outgrown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said, "Oh, yeah, this is me
And I'm right here where I wanna be"
I said, "Hell, yeah, this is me
Right where I'm supposed to be"

So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in my rebel heart
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart

In my rebel heart
In my rebel heart

I ran from my house that cannot contain me
From the man that I cannot keep
My mother who haunts me, even though she's gone
From my daughter that never sleeps
I ran from the noise and the silence
From the traffic on the streets
I ran to the treetops, I ran to the sky
Out to the lake, into the rain
That matted my hair and soaked my shoes and skin
Hid my tears, hid my fears

I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me

I ran past the churches and the crooked old mailbox
Past the apple orchards and the lady that never talks
Up into the hills, I ran to the cemetery
And held my breath, and thought about your death
I ran to the lake, up into the hills
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still
And I saw the crumbling tombstones
All forgotten names
I tasted the rain, I tasted my tears
I cursed the angels, I tasted my fears
And the ground gave way beneath my feet
And the earth took me in her arms
Leaves covered my face
Ants marched across my back
Black sky opened up, blinding me

I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me
I ran to the lakes, and up to the hill
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still

And I smelled her burning flesh
Her rotting bones
Her decay
I ran and I ran
I'm still running away

Something's missing and I don't know why
I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you
Is it me or you that I'm afraid of?
I tell myself I'll show you what I'm made of
Can't bring myself to let you go

Don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart, I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do?
I don't wanna feel blue

Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy
I'm not happy

Something's happened and I can't go back
I fall apart every time you hand your heart out to me
What happens now? I know I don't deserve you
I wonder how I'm ever gonna hurt you
Can't bring myself to let you go

I don't wanna cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart, I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do?
I don't wanna feel blue

Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips

But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby

It's all an illusion
There's too much confusion
It's all an illusion
There's too much confusion

Down, down, down in your heart
Find, find, find the secret

Baby we can do it, we can do it all right

Do you believe in love at first sight?
It's an illusion, I don't care
Do you believe I can make you feel better?
Too much confusion, come on over here

Can we get together?
I really, I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

I searched, I searched, I searched my whole life
To find, find, find the secret
But all I did was open up my eyes

[Song 84: Unapologetic Bitch]
28 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoUnapologetic Bitch Lyrics
Woke up this morning, feeling good that you were gone
Hurt for a while, but I'm finally moving on
Said it, did it, hit it, quit it, then you let it go
See you tryin' to call me, but I blocked you on my phone
It took a minute, but right now I'm feeling strong
It almost killed me, but I'm better off alone
Now you're saying that you're sorry, I don't wanna know
Better face the fact you had to go

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

You know, you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know, you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

I know you'd like it if I sat at home and cried
But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why
When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
When the gun was loaded, you were never on my side
I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
Said it, get it, love it, hate it, I don't care no more
Tell me how it feels to be ignored

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

You know, you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know, you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
It might sound like I'm an

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

You know, you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know, you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me

Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed
Deep in my heart I'm concealing

Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away

You're the best thing I had

Made a decision, I will never look back

Now my lover is dead and I have no regrets (He deserved it)

And I'm going straight to hell
And I got a lot of friends there
And if I see that bitch in hell
I'm gonna shoot him in the head again
'Cause I want to see him die
Over, and over, and over, and over
And over, and over, and over, and over
Now drive, bitch
I said drive, bitch
And while you're at it, die, bitch
That's right, drive, bitch
Now drive, bitch

And while you're at it, die bitch
That's right, drive bitch

To be in love with a masterpiece
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible

From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to white

Tiny particles of light

It seems to me that's what you're like
The look but please don't touch me type

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now, I realize

Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel in disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the poundin' of my heart and that's why

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now, I realize

Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel in disguise
I can see it in your eyes
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel in disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel in disguise
I can see it in your eyes
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel in disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel, baby

Clouds just disappear

I can't remember when I was young
I can't explain if it was wrong
My life goes on, but not the same
Into your eyes my face remains

I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground
I was so blind, I could not see
Your paradise is not for me

Autour de moi, je ne vois pas
Qui sont les anges? Sûrement pas moi
Encore une fois, je suis cassée
Encore une fois, je ne crois pas

I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground

There is a light above my head
Into your eyes, my face remains

I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground

I can't remember when I was young
Into your eyes, my face remains
Into your eyes, my face remains

I've been so high, I've been so down

I've been so high, I've been so down

[Song 98: Where Life Begins]
29 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoУкраїнськаWhere Life Begins Lyrics
Warm inside
Yeah

I'd like to direct your attention
To something that needs directing to
A lot of people talk about dining in and eating out
I guess that's what this song's about
I know this is not a dining room conversation
And you don't have to listen if you don't have the time
But let me remind you in case you don't already know
Dining out can happen down below

Everybody's talking 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different kind of kiss

So won't you go down where it's warm inside?
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down
That's where my love is

Now what could be better than a home cooked meal?
How you want to eat it depends on how you feel
You can eat all you want and you don't get fat
Now where else can you go for a meal like that?
It's not fair to be selfish and stingy
Every girl should experience eating out
Sometimes when I come home from a hard day at work
I swear it's all I can think about

Everybody's talking 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you go down where it's warm inside?
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down
That's where my love is

Colonel Sanders says it best
"Finger licking good"
Let's put what you've learned to the test
Can you make a fire without using wood?
Are you still hungry? Aren't you glad we came?
I'm glad you brought your raincoat
I think it's beginning to rain

Everybody's talking 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you go down where it's warm inside?
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down
That's where my love is
Where it's warm inside
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down
That's where my love is

That's where my love is
Come inside
That's where all life begins
It's warm inside

Baby face, don't grow so fast
Make a special wish that will always last
Rub this magic lantern
He will make your dreams come true for you
Ride the rainbow to the other side
Catch a falling star and then take a ride
To the river that sings and the clover that
Brings good luck to you, it's all true

Pink elephants and lemonade
Dear Jessie, hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day
Dear Jessie, see the roses raining on the love parade

If the land of make believe
Is inside your heart it will never leave
There's a golden gate where the fairies all wait
And dancing moons for you

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

Pink elephants and lemonade
Dear Jessie, hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day
Dear Jessie, see the roses raining on the love parade

Your dreams are made inside the love parade
It's a holiday inside the love parade

On the merry-go-round of lovers and white turtle doves
Leprechauns floating by, this is your lullaby
Sugarplum fingertips kissing your honey lips
Close your eyes sleepy head, is it time for your bed
Never forget what I said, hang on you're already there

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

Pink elephants and lemonade
Dear Jessie, hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day
Dear Jessie, see the roses raining on the love parade

Your dreams are made inside your love parade
It's a holiday inside your love parade

This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

Don't look back, keep your head held high, don't ask them why
Because life is short, and before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking, don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask

This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

No regrets, but I wish that you were here with me
Well, then there's hope yet, I can see your face in our secret place
You're not just a memory, say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)

This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me

Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy
And blessed are those who hear
And who keep what is written therein
For the time is near
He is coming with the clouds
And every eye will see him
Everyone who pierced him
And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him
Those of you who have not learned
What some call the deep things of Satan
I know your works
I know your toil
And your patient endurance
And how you cannot hear evil men
But have tested those who call themselves
Apostles
But are not
And found them to be false
I know you are enduring patiently
And bearing out
For my namesake
And you have not grown weary
But I have this against you
That you have abandoned
The love you had

I know your tribulation and your poverty
And the slander of those who say
That they are Jews
But they are not
They are a synagogue of Satan
Do not fear what you are about to suffer
Behold the devil is about to throw you into prison

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

And I saw a beast rising out of the sea
With ten horns and seven heads
And a blasphemous name upon its head
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard
Its feet were like a bear's
And its mouth was like a lion's mouth
And to it the dragon gave his power
And his throne
And great authority
One of his heads had a mortal wound
But it seemed to have a mortal wound
That was healed
And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder

Men worshipped the dragon
For he had given his authority to the beast
And they worshipped the beast saying
"Who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?"
And the beast was given a mouth
Uttering haughty and blasphemous words
And it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous
Words
Against
God
It was allowed to make war on the saints
And to conquer them
And authority was given it over every tribe
And a people and tongue and nation
And all who dwell on earth could worship it
In vain
If anyone has an ear let him hear
If anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go
If anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping

Then
I saw a new heaven
And a new earth
And I heard a great voice from the throne saying
"Behold the dwelling of God is with men
He will dwell with them
And they shall be his people
And God himself will be with them
He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
And death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning
Nor crying
Nor pain
Anymore
For these things will have passed away"
To the thirsty I will give water without price
From the fountain of the water of life
He who conquers shall have this heritage
And I will be his God and he shall be my son
But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolators
And all liars
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone
And he said to me
He said to me
"Do not seal up the words of the prophecy
For the time is near
Let the evildoers still do evil
And the filthy still be filthy
And the righteous still do right
And the holy still be holy
Behold
I am coming soon
I am the alpha
And the omega
The first
And the last
The beginning
And the end"
Amen

What are you gonna do?

Well, I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe in their moment of need
That they want what you want but they don't

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this

Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Waiting for you

It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings
Like you are now
What happened? What do I remind you of?
Your past? Your dreams?
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Waiting for you

Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me, who is going to take my place?

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why 'cause you're gonna have to justify

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me
I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me, who is going to take my place?

The truth in my whole life began
Say good-bye
To not knowing how to cry

Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you saved me

Inside
I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside
I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing

And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own

The way that you changed me

To let go
Of the illusion that we can possess
I learned
To let go
I travel in stillness

I know for sure his heart is here with me
Though I wish him back
I know he cannot see my hands trembling
I know he hears me sing

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this? If God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

He had to fight like all the rest
In the barrio, all the streets are paved with fear
I don't understand
At least he was a man

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this? If God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes, when will they ever learn?

You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight, but we cannot win this blind
Stand your gun's against the wall
Who's next in line to fall?

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this? If God exists

Tus lagrimas de tristeza
No me dejan olvidarte

Being destructive isn't brave
They couldn't say it to my face
One day, I won't care
But for the moment, I'm not there
I'll just close my eyes and let you catch me now

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah
I can't be a superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war, but I'm not going down
Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war, but I'm not Joan of Arc

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

You need so much, but not from me
Turn your back in my hour of need
Something's wrong, but you pretend you don't see
I think I interrupt your life
When you laugh, it cuts me just like a knife
I'm not your friend, I'm just your little wife

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

The bruises they will fade away
You hit so hard with the things you say
I will not stay to watch your hate as it grows
You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't if you don't

He's not in love with her anymore

You're not in love with someone else

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't if you don't

But she'll come back, she knows it then
A chance to start it all again

[Song 111: Love Profusion]
16 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoLove Profusion Lyrics
There are too many questions
There is not one solution
There is no resurrection
There is so much confusion

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love vibration
You make me feel
You make it shine

There are too many options
There is no consolation
I have lost my illusions
What I want is an explanation

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love direction
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

There is no comprehension
There is real isolation
There is so much destruction
What I want is a celebration

And I know I can feel bad
When I get in a bad mood
And the world can look so sad
Only you make me feel good

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love intention
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

And I know I can feel bad
When I get in a bad mood
And the world can look so sad
Only you make me feel good

Sitting on a park bench
Thinking about a friend of mine
He was only twenty-three
Gone before he had his time
It came without a warning
Didn't want his friends to see him cry
He knew the day was dawning
And I didn't have a chance to say goodbye

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?
What for?

Driving down the boulevard
Thinking about a man I knew
He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself
Said that we're all made of flesh and blood
Why should he be treated differently?
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case?
Ignorance is not bliss

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case?
Ignorance is not bliss

Have you ever watched your best friend die? (What for?)
Have you ever watched a grown man cry? (What for?)
Some say that life isn't fair (What for?)
I say that people just don't care (What for?)
They'd rather turn the other way (What for?)
And wait for this thing to go away (What for?)
Why do we have to pretend? (What for?)
Some day I pray it will end

I hope it's in this life
I hope it's in this life time
I hope it's in this life
I hope it's in this life time

Don't wanna get to the end of my days

Come over here!

Some girls, they like candy
And others, they like to grind
I'll settle for the back of your hand
Somewhere on my behind
Treat me like I'm a bad girl
Even when I'm being good to you
I don't want you to thank me
You can just spank me
Ooh!

Some guys like to sweet talk
And others, they like to tease
Tie my hands behind my back and
Ooh, I'm in ecstasy
Don't slobber me with kisses
I can get that from my sisters
Before I get too cranky
You better

Nothing like a good spanky (Good spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky

Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky, guy
Oooh!

Please don't call a doctor
'Cause there's nothing wrong with me
I just like things a little rough
And you better not disagree
'Cause I don't like a big softie, no!

Let me speak to you frankly

You give me

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
Listen to me, baby, hear every word I say
No one can love you the way I do
'Cause they don't know how to love you my way

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right
Bless my soul, I love you, take this heart away
Take these arms I'll never use
And just believe in what my lips have to say

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago
You give me fever, fever
You give me, you give me fever (Fever, fever, fever)

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, "Julie baby, you're my flame"
He gave her fever

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Fever, with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair (Fever)
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, "Daddy, oh, don't you dare"
He gives me fever, with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Missus
Daddy, won't you treat him right? (Fever)

Fever, when you kiss them
Fever, if you live and learn
Fever, 'til you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

A bad girl, I gotcha crying to your mumma
Saying "I can't believe it" (I can't believe it)
I've seen your type, bring a knife into a gun fight
Caught up in the law right
I think I'm in love and I

Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
My body's fully loaded
And I've got more ammo
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
Ay-oh-ee-oh
You're an accessory to murder, 'cause

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
I let it bang bang

I let it bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I line 'em up and watch them fall

Bang
Tha shooting name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain, she just screamed "shoot again"
I gave her extra rounds, my barrel twist around
I am Mr. shoot 'em down, I leave hearts on tha ground
My love is a weapon, and yes I use it well
Then I let the rose petals cover up the bullet shells
I never shoot and tell, I only shoot to kill
And the vest ain't gonna help it even if it's made of steel

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
My love's a revolver (Yeah)
My sex is a killer (Yeah)
Do you wanna die happy? (Yeah)
Do you wanna die happy? (Yeah)
My love's a revolver

Do you wanna die happy?

I let it bang bang

I line 'em up and watch them fall
Hey, I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I line 'em up and watch them fall

Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy? Yeah

[Song 123: Mother and Father]
21 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoУкраїнськаMother and Father Lyrics
There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

Oh, mother, why aren't you here with me?
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes, father, you know I'm not so free

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

Oh mother, why aren't you here with me?
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away
They couldn't take my loneliness, I couldn't take their phoniness (I've got to give it up, I've got to give it up)
My father had to go to work, I used to think he was a jerk
(I've got to give it up, I've got to give it up)
I didn't know his heart was broken
Not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of
I made a vow that I would never need another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage, a victim of a kind of rage
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
I've got to give it up

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
Find someone that I can care for
Find someone that I can care for

I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to let it go
I've got to give it up
Oh mother, oh father
I've got to give it up
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)

[Song 124: She’s Not Me]
28 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoShe’s Not Me Lyrics
I shoulda seen the sign way back then
When she told me that you were her best friend
And now she's rolling, rolling, rolling
And you were stolen, stolen, stolen
She started dressing like me and talking like me
It freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night
What's that about?

I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning
Next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast and love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

I shoulda seen the sign when you were here
Under a different light, it's all so clear
She was stealing, stealing, stealing
And now you're feeling, feeling, feeling
She started dyeing her hair and wearing the same perfume as me
She started reading my books and stealing my looks and lingerie

I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning
Next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast and love you in the shower
The thrill is momentary
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

She is licking her lips and she's batting her eyes (She's not me)
She's got legs up to there and such beautiful hair (She's not me)
Oh, devoted for life, make a beautiful wife (She's not me)
If you spend some more time, I guarantee you will find (She's not me)
I know I can do it better

If someone wants to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make up for the things you lack
You're gonna have to watch

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me and she never will be
Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me and she never will be

Gotta find you a way to show your feelings
I guess that was some bullshit saying you love me, love me
Guess my expectation hit the ceiling
When you come back, it will cost, just trust me, trust me
Wendy

She's not me, she's not me
She's not me and she never will be
She's not me, she's not me
She's not me and she never will be
She never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
She's not me and she never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
She's not me
Never will be, never will be (Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me)
(Me, me, me, me, me, me)
She's not me and she never will be, she never will be

20 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoУкраїнськаLike It or Not Lyrics
You can call me a sinner
You can call me a saint
Celebrate me for who I am
Dislike me for what I ain't
Put me up on a pedestal
Or drag me down in the dirt
Sticks and stones will break my bones
But your names will never hurt

I'll be the garden, you'll be the snake
All of my fruit is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow, because

This is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop, no no

Cleopatra had her way
Mata Hari too
Whether they were good or bad
Is strictly up to you
Life is a paradox
And it doesn't make much sense
Can't have the Femme without the Fatale
Please don't take offense

Don't let the fruit rot under the vine
Fill up your cup and let's drink the wine
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow, because

This is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop, no no
You know this is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop, no no, you know

No, no, you know
No, no, you know
No, no, you know
No, no, you know

I'll be the garden, you'll be the snake
All of my fruit is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow, because

This is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop, no no
You know this is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me or leave me

I'm in love with you, you silly thing
Anyone can see
What is it with you? You silly thing
Just take it from me
It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one

You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall
When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, you washed away my tears
Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, nothing fails

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved
Makes me wanna pray
Pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious
But I feel such love
Makes me wanna pray

Nothing fails, you washed away my tears

My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'll be your loved one darling
Turn off the light
I'll be your sorceress, your heart's magician
I'm not a witch, I'm a love technician
I'll be a guiding light in your darkest hour
I'm going to change your life, I'm like a poison flower

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
All over me
All over me
All over me

We could use the cage
I've got a lot of rope
I'm not full of rage
I'm full of hope
This is not a crime and you're not on trial
Bend over baby, I'm going to make you smile

Light the candles, until they're nice and soft
And when they start to drip, I'm going to get you off

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body

I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...
I could bring you so much pleasure

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
All over me
All over me

Little girl, don't you forget her face
Laughing away your tears
When she was the one who felt all the pain

Little girl, never forget her eyes
Keep them alive inside
I promise to try
But it's not the same

Keep your head held high
Ride like the wind
Never look behind, life isn't fair
That's what you said, so I try not to care

Little girl, don't run away so fast
I think you forgot to kiss
Kiss her goodbye

Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall?
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call?
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

I fought to be so strong
I guess you knew
I was afraid
You'd go away too

Little girl, you've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try
But it feels like a lie

Don't let memory play games with your mind
She's a faded smile frozen in time
I'm still hanging on
But I'm doing it wrong

Can't kiss her goodbye
But I promise to try

Tell me
We're gonna do that when we finish?
Yo, what's up?
What are we gonna do after we finish this?

Tick tick tock, Mo is on the jock
I did her in the limo as we went around the block
Sucked the mole on her hip, licked the lipstick off her lip
She got real excited, yo she started to flip
She says, "'Dré baby 'Dré baby, oh"
I said, "Just relax, ayo chill, Mo"
We made a right turn onto Central Park West
One hand gripped the car, the other on her breast

Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
Did you do it? I said I did it

But I backed out quick because I thought I split it

Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting

Uh, ho's in the front for the 1990's
Walking around showing off their heinies
Wiggling, they're jiggling, they're swinging and flinging
9-7-0, yo ho, your phone's ringing
You get a call from your John, you meet him at the mot'
He's chilling in a pamper and a fur coat
Your head starts spinning, you drunk too much gin and
Your jaw starts grinning, and this is the beginning
Of a night of an average ho
It ain't all about working on the streets no more
Here's another episode of dropping off a load
Peter was on the beater, I was about to explode
I couldn't hold back (So, whatcha do?)
I took her to my place (Yo, did she sit on your face?)
She was so good just like uh, Campbell's Soup
I won't try to front so here's the rude scoop
I dipped it and I stripped it and I ripped it like before
I had her screaming, nope no diddily, nope no more
I can't stop once I get started
But yo honey, uh, get them legs parted

Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

But I backed out quick because I thought I split it

Oh, my God!
They come with the rough stuff
Boy, we hit it, split it, and forget it
In the same order as you hear
But boy I'm not fronting
Don't ask what, me tell you the truth, you understand me eye?
The iron eye can get pissy, you know what I'm saying?
Clean up me rifle, clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, me elephant rifle
Clean up me rifle, you clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, elephant rifle
You know, you know, you moving slow
You make them tingle, yeah, you make them tingle

I flipped her from the top of my head, enough said
I'm the brother with the short, short dreads
A couple different styles, a couple different flows
Just some that my souls about some girls I know
I gotta hit it hard because I go for the gusto
And I cover up the moans by turning up my stereo

Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
Did you do it? Yo, you know I did it
Did you do it? Yo Mark, I said I did it
Did you do it? Yo
I backed out quick 'cause I thought I split it

You didn't do it, he didn't do it
I made her go

Waiting for you, just waiting
(Yo man, she been waiting, she keep on waiting)
Waiting for you
(Yeah, she been waiting, and you have not hit it)
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

Yo, Dré... Dré!
Yo man, you're so loud, Goddamn

In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden

There's a petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess?
Will I still be thirsty?
Will I pass the test?
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it?
Or will it pass right by?
Because I'm not supposed to see
Because the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking

For a petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

I still believe, I still believe
Because after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
Because the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong
And there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for-

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

Somewhere in Fontainebleau
Lies my secret garden

In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger, in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between
Life is like a desert
An oasis, to confuse me
So I walk this razor's edge
Will I stand or will I fall?

Turn a blind eye
Tried to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Torn between the impulse to stay or
Running away from all this madness

Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end, then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me

All of my illusions
Could be shattered in a second
You could thread a needle
With a teardrop from my eye
It's a cruel injustice
To be witness to the things I see
Looking for the answer
When it's right in front of me

From the tower of Babylon
Where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me

As quiet as it is tonight
You'd almost think you were safe
Your eyes are full of surprises
They cannot predict my fate
Waiting underneath the stars
There's something you should know
The angels, they surround my heart
Telling me to let you go

I bet he couldn't
I bet he couldn't recognize
But I played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

It's like over and over
You're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over
I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over
You can lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober
No more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you
But I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you
But I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you
But I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you
But I do, I do, I do

You almost fooled yourself this time, let all of the saints be praised
You hide your sadness behind your smile and you keep your lost heart raised (Your lost heart raised)
With steps that edge along the ledge is much higher than it seems
But I've been on that ledge before
You can't hide yourself from me

I bet he couldn't
I bet he couldn't recognize
I still played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

It's like over and over
You're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over
I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over
You can lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober
No more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you
But I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you
But I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you
But I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you
But I do, I do, I do

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It's like over and over
You're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over
I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over
You can lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober
No more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you
Devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, but, you, but, you, but
Devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you-you
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do, I-I, I do
You, you, you, you
Devil wouldn't recognize you (Recognize you, you, you)
But I do (You, you)
(You, you, you) Even the devil wouldn't recognize you (You, you)
But I-I-I-I-I do

Bitch!
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
How many licks does it take?
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
Which leg do you want me to break?
(You'll be sorry) You'll be sorry

Here she comes, little miss thinks she can have what she wants
In a blink of an eye
Here she comes, acts like she's your best friend
When you turn your back and she's off with your guy

She's a thief of hearts
What will happen to the thief of hearts?
What she does is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Someone please arrest her
She's a thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine
And gets away with it
Not this time

Here she comes, acting all dejected
So you give advice and she gives you her poison
Here she comes, little miss black widow
First she spins her web and she's stealing your boyfriend

She's a thief of hearts
What will happen to the thief of hearts?
What she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Someone please arrest her
She's a thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine
Thief of hearts

Bitch!
You'll do it, you'll take it
You'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it
You're over, you can't take it
You'll do it, you'll take it
You'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it
You're over, you can't take it
You can't take it, not what's mine
I could break you, 'cause what you've done is a crime
Bitch, he's mine

Here she comes, little miss thinks she can have his child
Well anybody can do it
Here she comes, little Susie ho-maker
Thinks she'll get respect if she screws it

She's a thief of hearts
What will happen to the thief of hearts?
What she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Someone please arrest her
She's a thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine

You'll be sorry, 'cause what you've done is a crime

She's a thief of hearts (Of hearts, of hearts)
Thief of hearts, what she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts (Of hearts, of hearts)
Thief of hearts, no one ever takes what's mine
She's a thief, thief

Forever, keep people together
Keep, keep it together

Forever, keep people together

I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle, tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face

I'm tired of sharing all the hand-me-downs
To get attention, I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said, 'Listen, you will always have a home"

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

I hit the big time, but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Just giving to get something, always wanting something back

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance

Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together

[Song 136: Nobody Knows Me]
21 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisPortuguêsItalianoNobody Knows Me Lyrics
I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died
I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up

This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire
I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

No one's telling me how to live my life
But it's a setup and I'm just fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine
I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me (It's no fun, but the damage is done)
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me (Don't want your social disease)
Li-like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me (Don't want your social disease)
Like you know me

Nobody knows me (I don't want no lies)
Nobody knows me (I don't watch TV)
Nobody knows me (I don't waste my time)
Like you know me (Won't read a magazine)
Nobody knows me (I don't want no lies)

Bye bye, baby

You had your chances, all your romances
And now I just don't want you
I know I love you because I hate you
And now I'd rather haunt you

What wakes you up inside?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?

So I'll just stop blowing in the wind
To love you is a sin
Adiós

Uh, this is not a love song
I'd like to hurt you
What excites you? What turns you on?
What makes you feel good?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say goodbye
Bye bye

First time and the last time
You can forget about it, baby
Forget the rules, forget the fools
Forget your fears, forget my tears
You can forget about it, baby
Bye bye, baby, bye bye
You can forget about it, baby
'Cause it's the first time and the last time
You'll ever see me cry
You f**cked it up

Time and time again I've said that I don't care
That I'm immune to gloom, that I'm hard through and through
But every time it matters all my words desеrt me
So anyone can hurt me, and thеy do

So what happens now?
Another suitcase in another hall

Where am I going to?
You'll get by, you always have before
Where am I going to?

Call in three months time and I'll be fine, I know
Well maybe not that fine, but I'll survive anyhow
I won't recall the names and places of each sad occasion
But that's no consolation here and now

You'll get by, you always have before
Where am I going to?

So pop the hood and see what's good, I need a tune-up bad
My pressure's low, I'm on a roll but my transmission's blown
I heard a thump and then a knock

I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can polish the headlights
You can smooth out the fender
You can start the ignition
We can go on a bender

Stuck to the seat, our body heat, what will you do with all this ass?
Let's shift our gears, get outta here, we're stepping on the gas
We gotta bounce, we're going fast, let's let the seat go back
You take the wheel, I'll sit on top

I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime

Overheating the engine
Might be blowing a gasket
Tighten up the suspension
And you don't have to ask it

I, I, I, I hear you work at a body shop
I, I, I, I hear you work at a body shop

I would drive to the ends of the earth for you
Jumpstart my heart, you know what you gotta do
I would ride through the dark of the night with you
Cross my heart and hope to die, it's true

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Got into the line

I hear you work at a body shop

Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

You think you're so smart
You try to manipulate me
You try to humiliate with your words
You think you're so chic
You write me beautiful letters
You think you're so much better than me

But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

You think you're so shrewd
You try to bring me low
You try to gain control with your words

But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

Friends they tried to warn me about you
He has good manners, he's so romantic
But he'll only make you blue
How can I explain to them
How could they know
I'm in love with your words
Your words

You think you're so sly
I caught you at your game
You will not bring me shame with your words

But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

Too much blinding light
Your touch, I've grown tired of your words
Words, words
A linguistic form that can meaningfully be spoken in isolation
Conversation, expression, a promise, a sigh
In short, a lie
A message from heaven, a signal from hell
I give you my word I'll never tell
Language that is used in anger
Personal feelings signaling danger
A brief remark, an utterance, information
Don't mince words, don't be evasive
Speak your mind, be persuasive
A pledge, a commitment, communication, words

Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone?
You won't admit it but you know it's true

You can't keep wishing on the stars, baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls, we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game, so get into the groove

And when it falls, we won't let it die

I hope you find what you're looking for

Who needs a home, with the stars up above

You are my sanctuary
Who needs the light, with the darkness in your eyes
Who needs to sleep, with the stars in the sky
It's here in your soul I want to be married
You are my sanctuary

And the earth was void and empty
And darkness was upon the face of the earth

Is all of this pain so necessary
You are my sanctuary

Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice

As the water follows the moon, silently

Scarred and we're bruised, but our hearts will guide us
Together, I know our love's gonna last forever
We're gonna be alright tonight

We'll live with no limits
We'll dance in the middle of the freezing rain
With you and I in it
Survive the eye of a hurricane (Oh)
Together, we're gonna make this better (Yeah)
We're gonna be alright tonight

Hold tight, as long as you're by my side
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright
Only love, only love tonight
Lights off, we're burning so bright
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
(Hey, hey, yeah, hey)

A million miles later
We walked through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised, but our hearts will guide us
Together, I know our love's gonna last forever (Yeah)
We're gonna be alright tonight

Hold tight, as long as you're by my side
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright
Only love, only love tonight
Lights off, we're burning so bright
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
(Hey, hey, yeah, hey)

I don't wanna breathe air that you're not breathing
I don't wanna hear if your heart's not beating
If you hurt, then I wanna be the one that's bleeding
Wanna be the one that's bleeding

Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Only love, only love tonight
Lights off, we're burning so bright
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna

[Song 148: I Deserve It]
19 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoУкраїнськаI Deserve It Lyrics
This guy was meant for me
And I was meant for him
This guy was dreamt for me
And I was dreamt for him
This guy has danced for me
And I have danced for him
This guy has cried for me
And I have cried for him

Many miles, many roads I have traveled
Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled
Leading up to today

This guy has prayed for me
And I have prayed for him
This guy was made for me
And I was made for him

Many miles, many roads I have traveled
Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled
Leading up to today

I have no regrets, there's nothing to forget
All the pain was worth it
Not running from the past
I tried to do what's best
I know that I deserve it

Many miles, many roads I have traveled
Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled
Leading up to today
Many miles, many roads I have traveled
Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled
Leading up to today

And I thank you

[Song 149: HeartBreakCity]
25 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoPortuguêsHeartBreakCity Lyrics“HeartBreakCity” is a piano ballad talking about lost love with Madonna singing in deeper vocal register, inspired by baroque pop. Containing synths, banjo sounds and hollow drums.
Cut me down the middle
Fucked me up a little
You said I was your queen
I tried to give you everything
And now you want your freedom
You got just what you came for
A bit of fame and fortune
Now I'm no longer needed

You said it was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends
You had a few secrets I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

Now I'm in the middle of Heartbreak City (Heartbreak City)
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Your clever game got the best of me (Best of me)
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me (Rest of me)
'Cause I'm in Heartbreak City

Tore me into pieces
Didn't have no damn reason
I let you in my house
You helped yourself to everything
And left me with your mess
I curse the day we met
Your memory is haunting me
I wish I could forget

You said it was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends
You had a few secrets I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

I'm in the middle of Heartbreak City (Heartbreak City)
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Your clever game got the best of me (Best of me)
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me (Rest of Me)
'Cause I'm in Heartbreak City

And it's not that pretty

These are my hands, but what can they give me?
These are my eyes, but they cannot see
These are my arms, but they don't know tenderness
And I must confess that I am usually drawn to sadness
And loneliness has never been a stranger to me

But love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

These are my lips, but they whisper sorrow
This is my voice, but it's telling lies
I know how to laugh, but I don't know happiness
And I must confess
Instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
I was covered with dust and sin
Love tried to take me in
Love tried to break me

And I must confess, instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
(I was) guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Covered with dust and sin
Love tried to take me in
Love tried to break me (Love tried to welcome me)
But my soul drew back
(Guilty of lust and sin) I was covered with dust, covered with sorrow
(Love tried to take me in) Covered

Still, love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin (Covered with dust and sin)
Love tried to take me in
Love tried to break me (Love tried to welcome me)
Love tried to welcome me (But my soul drew back)
But my soul drew back (Guilty of lust and sin)
I was covered with sadness (Love tried to take me in)
Love tried to welcome me
