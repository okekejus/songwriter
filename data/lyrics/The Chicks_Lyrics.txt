Two days past eighteen
He was waitin' for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair

He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said, "Would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me? I'm feelin' a little low"
She said "I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go"

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said "I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?"

I cried, "Never gonna hold the hand of another guy"
"Too young for him," they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, "A soldier's comin' home"

So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of

He said, "When it's gettin' kinda rough over here
I think of that day sittin' down on the pier
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while"

I cried, "Never gonna hold the hand of another guy"
"Too young for him," they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, "A soldier's comin' home"


One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said, "Folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead?"

Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marchin' band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

I cried, "Never gonna hold the hand of another guy"
"Too young for him," they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, "A soldier's comin'..."

I cried, "Never gonna hold the hand of another guy"
"Too young for him," they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, "A soldier's comin' home"

Forgive? Sounds good
Forget? I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

I'm through with doubt
There's nothin' left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep payin'

I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should

I know you've said
"Can't you just get over it?"
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it

I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter, sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
What it is you think I should

Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

We moved to California and we followed your dreams

Swore that night 'til death do us part

You thought I wouldn't see it if you put it in my face
Give you all my money, you'll gladly walk away
You think it's justifiable, I think it's pretty cruel
And you know you lie best when you lie to you
'Cause, boy, you know exactly what you did on my boat
And, boy, that's exactly why you ain't comin' home
Save your tired stories for your new someone else

Tried to say I'm crazy, babe, we know I'm not crazy, that's you

You're a li-li-li-liar
Oh, honey, that's you

You made your bed and then your bed caught fire

Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

Well, it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well, she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red-eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die
Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said "Thank you ladies, if you hear from him let us know,"

Well, the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well, is that all right?
Good, let's go for a ride Earl
Hey

Well hey, hey, hey
Aw, hey, hey, hey
Well hey, hey, hey

I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well


Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well, I'm getting older, too

So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills

Well, maybe
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
The landslide will bring you down

March, march to my own drum

Hey, hey, I'm an army of one

Brenda's packin' heat 'cause she don't like Mondays
Underpaid teacher policin' the hallways
Print yourself a weapon and take it to the gun range
(Ah, cut the shit, you ain't goin' to the gun range)
Standin' with Emma and our sons and daughters
Watchin' our youth have to solve our problems
I'll follow them, so who's comin' with me?
(Half of you love me, half already hate me)

March, march to my own drum

Hey, hey, I'm an army of one

Hey, hey, I'm an army of one

Tell the ol' boys in the white bread lobby
What they can and can't do with their bodies
Temperatures are risin', cities are sinkin'
(Ah, cut the shit, you know your city is sinkin')
Lies are truth and truth is fiction
Everybody's talkin', who's gonna listen?
What the hell happened in Helsinki?

March, march to my own drum

[Song 7: Wide Open Spaces]
18 ContributorsWide Open Spaces Lyrics
Who doesn't know what I'm talkin' about
Who's never left home, who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

Many precede and many will follow
A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes

She traveled this road as a child
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes
She knows the high stakes

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

As her folks drive away her dad yells, "Check the oil"
Mom stares out the window and says, "I'm leavin' my girl"
She said, "It didn't seem like that long ago"
When she stood there and let her own folks know

She needed, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes
She knows the high stakes
She knows the highest stakes

(Wide open spaces)
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes
(Wide open spaces)

[Song 8: Sleep at Night]
18 ContributorsSleep at Night Lyrics
Not that you asked
But I'm getting past everything, everything
I'm doing okay
Just glad it's not yesterday, huh

My husband's girlfriend's husband just called me up
How messed up is that?
It's so insane that I have to laugh
But then I think about our two boys trying to become men
There's nothing funny about that

How do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you tell those lies? (Oh)
Lookin' me in the eye (Oh)
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you sleep at night?

You're only as sick as your secrets
So I'm telling everything
Half of the shit you won't believe
But I know it's not unique to me

Remember you brought her to our show at the Hollywood Bowl
She said, "I love you, I'm such a fan"
I joked that you can love me as long as you don't love my man
There's nothin' funny about that

How do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you tell those lies? (Oh)
Lookin' me in the eye (Oh)
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you sleep at night?

So caught up in your story
You don't care what you're ruining
So caught up in your story
But you don't care

How do you sleep at night?
How do you tell those lies?
Lookin' me in the eye
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night?
How do you sleep at night?

Oh (Oh)
How do you tell those lies? (Oh)
How do you tell those lies?
Lookin' me in the eye (Oh)
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night? (Oh)

Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to Heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you"

I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me

Cowboy, take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can, into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to Heaven above and closer to you

I can't find a reason to let go
Even though you've found a new love and she's what your dreams are made of
I can find a reason to hang on
What went wrong can be forgiven, without you, it ain't worth livin' alone

Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take you away
When for so long you were mine?

I took out all the pictures of our wedding day
It was a time of love and laughter, happy ever after
But even those old pictures have begun to fade
Please tell me she's not real and that you're really comin' home to stay

Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine?

I can give you two good reasons
To show you love's not blind
He's two and she's four and you know they adore you
So, how can I tell them you've changed your mind?

Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine?

I remember when you were mine

Hate you 'cause I want to

While everybody loves you
It's my body and I'm trying to
Forgive you, I don't want to
It's my body and it hates you
Why does everybody love you?

Sometimes, I close my eyes
Amidst the dancing lights
When it feels too wild for breathing
I can't sleep at night
Unless I start to lie
And believe it like a story, no, no

Try not to think about it
So insane, I'm so used to my nightmares
It's okay 'til it's not and I'm back there
No, no

It's my body and I'm trying to
Hate you 'cause I want to
It's my body and I'm trying to
While everybody loves you

Forgive you, I don't want to

They don't know enough about you

Why does everybody love you?

Do they know that I regret you?

To the piece you know he's gonna try to take when he's gone
And you know exactly where he'll try to take it from
Breathe, it'll be okay

And strut the fuck around like you've got nothin' to lose
Show off, show off, show off your best moves
And do it with a smile so he doesn't know it's
Put on, put on, put on
Put on, put on

Don't think about his lips
How every time he'd kiss you, you'd tremble
Try to only think about the bad things you remember
Breathe, it'll be okay

Sometimes, what's going through your head
Is just a temporary situation
And light will soon be shed, oh

Just put on, put on, put on your best shoes
And strut the fuck around like you've got nothin' to lose
Show off, show off, show off your best moves

9 ContributorsMy Best Friend’s Weddings LyricsAs promotion for the release of Gaslighter, The Chicks revealed the lyrics to “My Best Friend’s Weddings” through their Twitter on July 12, 2020.
Met you at my best friend's wedding
There was something about you
You set off fireworks that evening
With a flicker of untruth

Jump twenty years, jump twenty years, twenty years, yeah
Lookin' back, in retrospect
I was never safe, I was never safe, still not safe, yeah
You'd torch me any chance you'd get

I see a wildfire comin'
Burnin' the world that I've known
Watch me, watch me outrun it
Take what I need and go

Strangest thing not having you here with me
Then I realized
That I prefer my own company
To yours anytime

In twenty years, twenty years, twenty years, yeah
I'll still be younger than you
I'm better off, I'm better off, better off, yeah
Without your gloom and your doom

'Cause I can see a wildfire comin'
Burnin' the world that I know
Watch me, watch me outrun it
Take what I need and go

Go it alone, go it alone
Go it alone, go it alone
Go it alone, go it alone
Go it alone, go it alone
Go it alone, go it alone
Go it alone, go it alone

I'm back here at my best friend's wedding
Yeah, she married again
I've never seen her look more happy
Guess from ashes, we can really grow

And my wildfire's comin'
Burnin' the path that I've known
Watch me, yeah, watch me run with it
Take it wherever it goes

And I'll go it alone, go it alone
Go it alone, go it alone (Go it alone)
Oh
Oh

Go it alone
Go it alone
Go it alone
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Song 17: Lullaby]
8 ContributorsLullaby Lyrics
They didn't have you where I come from
Never knew the best was yet to come
Life began when I saw your face
And I hear your laugh like a serenade

How long do you wanna be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you wanna be loved?
Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

I slip in bed when you're asleep
To hold you close and feel your breath on me
Tomorrow there'll be so much to do
So tonight I'll drift in a dream with you

How long do you wanna be loved? (Wanna be loved)
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you wanna be loved? (Wanna be loved)
Is forever enough
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

As you wander through this troubled world
In search of all things beautiful
You can close your eyes when you're miles away
And hear my voice like a serenade

How long do you wanna be loved?
(How long do you wanna be loved?)
(Do you wanna be loved?)
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you wanna be loved?
(How long do you wanna be loved?)
(Do you wanna be loved?)
Is forever enough
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up
How long do you wanna be loved?
(How long do you wanna be loved?)
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you wanna be loved?
(How long do you wanna be loved?)
(Wanna be loved)
Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

8 ContributorsSet Me Free Lyrics
I've done what I know
To help me move on
I've been sick from the hurt
I've cried alone
Why, oh why do you keep me tethered?
You've taken enough from me
Untangle me from your lifeline
Why not just set me free?

Don't you feel you're wasting time?
You have the power to make it right

Decency
Would be for you to sign and release me
If you ever loved me
Then will you do this one last thing?
Set me free, set me free
Oh, set me free

To have and to hold
Oh, the weight of this hate was exhausting
You risked my body, broke my spirit
And still, I've let you go

Just because you've been a bad guy
I've seen it with my own eyes
There's a good guy in there

Decency
Would be for you to sign and release me
If you ever loved me
Then will you do this one last thing?
Set me free, set me free
Oh, set me free
Set me free, let me be
Oh, set me free

I had no words for you that Saturday
As we both watched our entire worlds change
Your hero fell just as you came of age
And I had no words, but now I know what to say

You're of me, not mine
Walk your own crooked line
I promise you'll be fine
Take the best parts of him
As your own life begins
Leave the bad news behind you

Young man
Take a good look at my life and
Try to understand
I've done my best the best I know how to
And my blues aren't your blues
It's up to you

After this storm
There's nothing you can't navigate
Point to the truth
You'll see it's the only way

You're of me, not mine
Perfect in my eyes
You're gonna be alright
Take the best parts of him
As your own life begins
Leave the bad news behind

Young man
Take a good look at my life and
Try to understand
I've done my best the best I know how to
And my blues aren't your blues
It's up to you

And my blues aren't your blues
You'll walk in your own shoes

Daddy sits on a front porch swinging
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca
Now he knows it never will
My Brothers found work in Indiana
M' Sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama still cooking too much for supper
And me I’ve been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

Deliah plays that ol' church pian'a
Sitting out on her daddy’s farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

Now me, I went to Nashville
Tryin' to beat the big deal
Playin' down on Broadway
Gettin' there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I’m gonna be a star

Now, me and Deliah singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin’
But the music ain't got no soul
Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They've got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think
The rest is a long time gone
No, I ain't hit the roof since I don’t know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back
I said a long time gone
No, I ain't honked the horn since I don’t know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again
I said a long time, long time, long time gone
Well it’s been a long time
Long time, long time, long time gone
Oh, it's been a long time gone
Long time, long time, long time gone

It should've been different, but it wasn't different, was the
Same old story, "Dear John," and so long
It should've fit like a glove, it should've fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring, a token of true love

Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble

So now you're thinkin' 'bout all you're missin' how
Deep you're sinkin', 'round and 'round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips, why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck

Could've been true love, but it wasn't
It should all add up, but it doesn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble

Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There is your trouble

Dragon tales and the "water is wide"
Pirates sail and lost boys fly
Fish bite moonbeams every night
And I love you

Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams

The rocket racer's all tuckered out
Superman's in pajamas on the couch
Goodnight moon will find the mouse
And I love you

Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams

God bless mommy and matchbox cars
God bless dad and thanks for the stars
God hears "Amen," wherever we are
And I love you

Sweet dreams, little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams

There I go trying to keep myself distracted
So I make the bed, call a friend, do the dishes
Should I have known? Should I have seen a sign?
When did you know? Why'd you pretend to try?

If you’re gone
I hope it's really worth it
Twenty years of hanging on
Now it all adds up to nothin'
Gave up on the moon and back
Thought you’d found a better half
Ah, I hope it's something good

Highs and lows, we fought our wars with silence
I'd have called you out, but baby, I knew you'd deny it
After so long, I learned to hold my tongue
And now that you're done, I get to write this song

And if you're gone
I hope it's really worth it
Twenty years of hanging on
Now it all adds up to nothin'
Gave up on the moon and back
Thought you’d found a better half
Ah, I hope it’s something good

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

If you're gone
I hope it’s really worth it
Twenty years of hanging on
Now it all adds up to nothin'
When you gave up on the moon and back
Thought you'd found your better half
I hope she's something good

[Song 24: Easy Silence]
10 ContributorsEasy Silence Lyrics
When the calls and conversations
Accidents and accusations
Messages and misperceptions
Paralyze my mind
Busses, cars, and airplanes leaving
Burning fumes of gasoline
And everyone is running
And I come to find a refuge in the

Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay

Monkeys on the barricades
Are warning us to back away
They form commissions trying to find
The next one they can crucify
And anger plays on every station
Answers only make more questions
I need something to believe in
Breathe in sanctuary in the

Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay

Children lose their youth too soon
Watching war made us immune
And I've got all the world to lose
But I just want to hold on to the

Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay
Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay

I wished I was stronger
I wished I loved Jesus
The way my wife does
I wished it had been easier
Instead of any longer
I wished I could have stood
Where you would've been proud
But that won't happen now
That won't happen now

There's a whole lot of singin' that's never gonna be heard
Disappearin' every day without so much as a word, somehow
Think I broke the wings off that little songbird
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now
Top of the world

I don't have to answer
Any of these questions
Don't have no God to
Teach me no lessons
I come home in the evenin'
Sit in my chair
One night they called me for supper but I never got up
I stayed right there in my chair

There's a whole lot of singin' that's never gonna be heard
Disappearin' every day without so much as a word, somehow
Think I broke the wings off that little songbird
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now

I wished I'da known you
Wished I'da shown you
All of the things I
Was on the inside
I'd pretend to be sleepin'
When you come in in the mornin'
To whisper goodbye
Go to work in the rain
I don't know why
Don't know why

'Cause everyone's singin', we just wanna be heard
Disappearin' every day without so much as a word, somehow
Wanna grab a hold of that little songbird
Take her for a ride to the top of the world right now

Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world

My friends from high school
Married their high school boyfriends
Moved into houses in the same ZIP codes
Where their parents live
But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow
I hit the highway in a pink RV with stars on the ceiling
Lived like a gypsy
Six strong hands on the steering wheel

I've been a long time gone now
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
But I've always found my way somehow
By taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around

I met the queen of whatever
Drank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies
Moved with the shakers
Wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to
No I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow

It's been two long years now
Since the top of the world came crashing down
And I'm getting it back on the road now
But I'm taking the long way
Taking the long way around
I'm taking the long way
I'm taking the long way around
Oh, I just take my time
I won't lay down
And take the long way around

Well, I fought with a stranger and I met myself
I opened my mouth and I heard myself
It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself
Guess I could've made it easier on myself
But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow

Well, I never seem to do it like anybody else
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
If you ever wanna find me, I can still be found
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around

Taking the long way
Taking the long way
I'm taking the long way
Taking the long way around
I'm taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around

He lived his life
Now I'm gonna go live mine
I'm sick of wastin' my time
Well now I've been good for way too long

'Bout to get too far gone

Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Need a little bit more of my twelve ounce nutrition
One more helpin' of what I've been havin'
I'm takin' my turn on the sin wagon

On a mission to make something happen
Feel like Delilah lookin' for Samson
Do a little mattress dancin'
That's right I said mattress dancin'

Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Need a little bit more
Of what I've been missin'
I don't know where I'll be crashin'
But I'm arrivin' on a sin wagon

When it's my turn to march up to old glory
I'm gonna have one hell of a story
That's if he forgives me
Oh, lord please forgive me

Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Need a little bit more of that sweet salvation
They may take me
With my feet draggin'
But I'll fly away on a sin wagon
I'll fly away on a sin wagon

Makin' love into memories
I guess you got what you wanted
But what about me

'Cause without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh

Somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart

And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh

Lookin' back and longin' for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your lovin' arms again

She'll find out when the new wears off
He'll find somebody new
She'll learn what the heartache's all about
And what I'm goin' through

But tonight, the heartache's on me, on me, yeah

In this fool's paradise

Get to Heaven now

Throwing stones from the top of your rock
Thinking no one can see
The secrets you hide behind
Your southern hospitality
On the strip the kids get lit
So they can have a real good time
Come Sunday they can just take their pick
From the crucifix skyline

'Cause this is the only place
Where as you're getting on the plane
You see Buddy Holly's face
I hear they hate me now
Just like they hated you
Maybe when I'm dead and gone
I'm gonna get a statue too

To hell's half acre

How will I ever
Get to Heaven now

You don't like the sound of the truth
Coming from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well baby that might be so
I might get to the end of my life
Find out everyone was lying
I don't think that I'm afraid anymore say that I would rather die trying

Woh-oh
Swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips

This time when he swung the bat
And I found myself laying flat I wondered
What a way to spend a dime
What a way to use the time, ain't it baby
I looked at my reflection in the window walking past
And I saw a stranger
Just so scared all the time it makes me one more reason
Why the world's dangerous

Woh-oh
Swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips

You don't like the sound of the truth
Coming from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well baby that might be so
Tell me what's wrong with having a little faith
In what you're feeling in your heart
Why must we be so afraid
And always so far apart

Woh-oh
Swing me way down south
Sing me something brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you

[Song 35: Let Him Fly]
9 ContributorsLet Him Fly Lyrics
Ain't no talkin' to this man
Ain't no pretty other side
Ain't no way to understand
Stupid words of pride
It would take an acrobat
And I already tried all that
I'm gonna let him fly, mmm

Things can move at such a pace
The second hand just waved goodbye
You know the light has left his face
You can't recall just where or why
So there was really nothin' to it
I just went and cut right through it
I said, I'm gonna let him fly, ooh yeah, yeah

There's no mercy in a live wire, no rest at all in freedom
The choices we are given it's... it's no choice at all, oh oh
The proof is in the fire, you touch before it moves away, yeah
But you must always know how long to stay and when to go

And there ain't no talkin' to this man
He's been tryin' to tell me so
It took a while to understand
The beauty of just letting go
'Cause it would take an acrobat
And I already tried all that
I'm gonna let him fly

I'm gonna let him fly, fly
Oh oh-oh oh oh
I'm gonna let him fly, oh-oh
I'm... I'm gonna let him fly

You finally took my hand
You finally took my hand
It took a nip of gin
But you finally took my hand

You can't afford no ring
You can't afford no ring

Daddy says he's the best in town
And mama don't approve

Say I do and kiss me quick
Because baby's on its way
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring

6 ContributorsIf I Fall You’re Going Down with Me Lyrics
Was it the pull of the moon now baby
That led you to my door
You say the night's got you acting crazy
I think it's something more
I've never felt the Earth move honey
Until you shook my tree
Nobody runs from the law now baby
Of love and gravity it pulls you so strong
Baby you gotta hold on

If I fall you're going down with me
You're going down with me baby if I fall
You can't take back every little chill you give me
You're going down with me baby heart and all ooh yeah

We're hanging right on the edge now baby
The wind is getting stronger
We're hanging on by a thread now honey
We can't hold on much longer
It's a long way down but it's too late

If I fall you're going down with me
You're going down with me baby if I fall
You can't take back every little chill you give me
You're going down with me baby heart and all ooh yeah

Ooh baby I couldn't get any higher
This time I'm willing to dance on the wire
If I fall, If I fall

If I fall you're going down with me
You're going down with me baby if I fall
You can't take back every little chill you give me
You're going down with me baby, heart and all ooh yeah

If I fall

I was only a kid
When I said goodbye to you
Ten summers ago
But it feels like yesterday
Lost, scared and alone
Nothing I could give to you
I tried, I really did
But I couldn't find another way

And I want, I need
Somehow to believe
In the choice I made
Am I better off this way?

I can hear the voice inside my head
Saying you should be with me instead
Every time I'm feeling down, I wonder
What would it be like with you around

So I, I made my way
Cold and roaming in the wild
I'm forever changed
By someone I never knew
Now I've, I've got a place
I've got a husband and a child
But I'll never forget
What I've given up in you

And I want, I need
Somehow to believe
In the choice I made
Am I better off this way?

I can hear the voice inside my head
Saying you should be with me instead
Every time I'm feeling down, I wonder
What would it be like with you around

And I want, I need
Somehow to believe
In the choice I made
Am I better off this way?

I can hear the voice inside my head
Saying you should be with me instead
Every time I'm feeling down, I wonder
What would it be like with you around

What would it be like with you around
What would it be like with you around

5 ContributorsI’ll Take Care of You Lyrics
Times are hard and rents are high
What can a workin' girl do
But struggle through another day
Then I'll take care of you

Nights are long and dreams are cold
If they're all you wake up to
But should you rise with cryin' eyes
Then I'll take care of you

So, let them talk about us, let them call us funny things
People sometimes do
Oh, I don't care, as long as you know I love you
Oh, and you know I do

I'll be there, but you might not see me
It's never easy to get through
But when the laughter dies away
Then I'll take care of you

But when the laughter dies away
Then I'll take care of you

6 ContributorsLet ’Er Rip Lyrics
I can tell there's somethin' you don't wanna tell me
It's killin' you 'cause the words are hard to find
I know you want to break it to me gently
Well, sweet baby, say what's on your mind

Let 'er rip, let it fly
Come on baby, say it, do you think I'm gonna cry?
I ain't about to bawl
And I ain't gonna die
So, if you're gonna say goodbye, don't take all day and night
Let 'er rip, let it fly

Why the drama? We don't have to drag out this situation
It wasn't you, it wasn't me, sometimes the chemistry don't ignite
There ain't no rings, no mortgage, there ain't any complications
It's just a hyphenated word, get it out, I'm sure I'll be alright

Let 'er rip, let it fly
Come on baby, say it, do you think I'm gonna cry?
I ain't about to bawl
And I ain't gonna die
So, if you're gonna say goodbye, don't take all day and night
Let 'er rip, let it fly


It ain't no big deal, it ain't no great loss
You and I are on the same train of thought
So, you don't have to tell me where to get off
Maybe I misunderstood you, if you're leavin', baby, would you?

Let 'er rip, let it fly
Come on baby, say it, do you think I'm gonna cry?
I ain't about to bawl, and I ain't gonna die
So, if you're gonna say goodbye, don't take all day and night
Let 'er rip, let it fly

So, if you're gonna say goodbye, don't take all day and night
Let 'er rip, let it fly

[Song 41: Everybody Knows]
6 ContributorsEverybody Knows Lyrics
Tell me now if you came sneaking up behind
Would you know me and see behind the smile?
I can change like colors on a wall
Hoping no one else will find what lies beneath it all
I think I hide it all so well

Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows
Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows

Looking through the crowd
I search for something else
But every time I turn around
I run into myself
Here I stand
Consumed with my surroundings
Just another day
Of everybody looking
I swore they'd never see me cry
You'll never see me cry

Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows
Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows

You say I'll pay the price
That's the chance that I'll take
Though you may think I'm telling lies
But I just call it getting by

Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows
Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows

Everybody knows
I'm just barely getting by
Everybody knows
I'm just barely getting by
Everybody knows

[Song 42: A Home]
5 ContributorsA Home Lyrics
I mistook the warnings for wisdom
From so-called friends quick to advise
Though your touch was telling me
Otherwise

Somehow I saw you as a weakness
I thought I had to be strong
Oh, but I was just young, I was scared
I was wrong

Not a night goes by I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been
A home

Guess I did what I did believing
That love is a dangerous thing
Oh but that couldn't hurt anymore
Than never knowing

Not a night goes by I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been
A home
A home

Four walls, a roof, a door, some windows
Just a place to run when my workin' day is through
They say home is where the heart is
If the exception proves the rule, I guess that's true

Not a night goes by I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been
A home
A home

4 ContributorsSilent House Lyrics
These walls have eyes
Rows of photographs
And faces like mine
Who do we become
Without knowing where
We started from

It's true; I'm missing you
As I stand alone in your room
Every day that will pass you by
Every name that you won't recall
Everything that you made by hand
Everything that you know by heart

And I will try to connect
All the pieces you left
I will carry it on
And let you forget
And I'll remember the years
When your mind was clear
How the laughter and life
Filled up this silent house

One room
Two single beds
In the closet hangs
Your favorite dress
The books that you read
Are in scattered piles
Of paper shreds
Everything that you made by hand
Everything that you know by heart

And I will try to connect
All the pieces you left
I will carry it on
And let you forget
And I'll remember the years
When your mind was clear
How the laughter and life
Filled up this silent house

In the garden off the living room
A chill fills the air
And the lilies bloom

And I will try to connect
All the pieces you left
I will carry it on
And let you forget
And I'll remember the years
When your mind was clear
How the laughter and life
Filled up this
And I will try to connect
All the pieces you left
I will carry it on
And let you forget
And I'll remember the years
When your mind was clear
How the laughter and life
Filled up this silent house
Silent house

The moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Your bags are packed not a word is spoken
I guess we said everything with good-bye
Time moves so slow and promises get broken
On this cold day in July

Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands
Here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away

You said that we were gonna last forever
You said our love would never die
It looks like spring and
It feels like sunny weather
But it's a cold day in July

Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands
Here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away

The moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long how I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that
You would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Here comes that cold day in July

Oh
Yeah
Oh yeah
La da da la da da la da da
Oh Ooo

6 ContributorsAm I the Only One (Who’s Ever Felt This Way) Lyrics
There is no good reason
I should have to be so alone
I'm smothered by this emptiness
Lord, I wish I was made of stone
Like a fool, I lent my soul to love
And it paid me back in change

God help me
Am I the only one who's ever felt this way?

A heart that's worn and weathered
Would know better than to fight
But I wore mine like a weapon
Played out love like a crime
And it wrung me out and strung me out
And it hung years on my face

God help me
Am I the only one who's ever felt this way?


Now my sense of humor needs a break
I see a shadow in the mirror
And she's laughin' through her tears
One more smile's all I can fake

There is a wound inside me
And it's bleeding like a flood
There's times when I see a light ahead
But hope is not enough
And another night surrounds me
And it pounds me like a wave

God help me
Am I the only one who's ever felt this way?
God help me
Am I the only one who's ever felt this way?

This heart of mine is made of silver
This heart of mine is made of gold
It will shine like a candle
When your world is dark and cold

This heart of mine is made of timber
This heart of mine is made of stone
When you're walking all alone
Like a bridge across the mountain
When you're walking all alone
This heart of mine is made of iron
This heart of mine is made of steel
It won't turn toward another
When the wind is on the heal
When the wind is on the heal
When your world is dark and cold

This heart of mine is made of silver
This heart of mine is made of gold
It will shine like a candle
When your world is dark and cold

I made a promise to myself
Locked it away deep down inside
Told my heart we'd wait it out
Swore we'd never compromise
Oh, I'd rather be alone
Like I am tonight
Than settle for the kind of love
That fades before the morning light

Silence stared me in the face
And I finally heard its voice
It seemed to softly say
That in love you have a choice
Today I got the answer
And there's a world of truth behind it
Love is out there waiting somewhere
You just have to go and find it

I believe in love
I believe in love
A love that's real, love that's strong
Love that lives on and on
Yes, I believe in love


I believe in love, I believe in love
A love that's real, love that's strong
Love that lives on and on
Yes, I believe in love

It was about five until five on Friday
We were all getting ready to go
And the boss man started screaming
And his veins began to show
He said you and you come with me
Cause you're going to have to stay
My heart was thumping I was jumping
I had to get away

Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance

Well I was talking with my baby
Over a small glass of tea
He asked the loaded question
It seems unreal to me that
He said how do you feel about me
My mind was racing I was pacing
But the words just wouldn't come
And there was only one thing
Left to do I feel it coming on

Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance

You got to loosen up those chains and dance
Come on and loosen up those chains and dance

Can't you see you're gettin' the run around

Oh, it's plain to see you'd rescue me
From my loneliness, so-called unhappiness
Oh, I didn't mean to cause you pain

Whoa, this bird can't sing when you've tied its wings
Don't waste your heart on me

It's funny how the girls get burned
And, honey, as far as I'm concerned
The tables have turned

You don't waste your heart on a wild thing
She's got a soul that won't settle on one thing
Whoa, this bird can't sing when you've tied its wings
Don't waste your heart on me

And I'm here to apologize
My heart can't compromise
Don't waste your heart on me

Please don't let me die in Florida
I don't care about my name
If you catch me dying in Daytona
Roll my bed onto a train

I was born in Indian summer
In the south end long ago
And those dirty streets cried out for rain
And this is what I know
And the rain came and they only stopped
Just in time for snow
And the icy cold filled up my shoes
And this is what I know

Please don't let me die in Florida
I don't care about my name
If you catch me dying in Ocala
Roll my bed on to a train

Well we went to war to fight the Japs
When the war was over, I threw my cap
Just as far as you could throw a thing
I went home and gave my girl a ring
I put thе highways and the black top down
Turned the prairiеs into the towns
And those hills gave way just like a wedding gown
I put the highways and the black top down

I don't need to see no mirror
I ain't never gonna see my own face
Just a reflection of somebody
Who's gonna leave without a trace
Roll me over them hills so cold and proud
Let the night come in and lay my shroud
I never been to California
Maybe that's where I could end my days

Don't let me die in Florida
I don't care about my name
If you catch me dying in Daytona
Roll my bed on to a train

Hugged your friends
Kissed your mama goodbye
Baby in your arms and a tear in your eye
Twelve hundred miles and you never asked why from me
Me and the baby and you side by side
We all knew we was in for a long hard ride
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide it seemed
We honked the horn when we crossed the state line
Woke up the baby and she started to cry
She must have known what we were going to find

This ain't nothing but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancing
Without the sound
It ain't nothing no nothing
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're going to climb
Pat on the back 'n' better luck next time
It ain't nothing no it ain't nothing but a heartbreak town

Stardust well it's a funny thing
It can make you cuss
It can make you sing
And the need to touch it gets hard to explain some days
I've seen them rise
I've seen them fall
Some get nothing
And Lord some get it all
Some just run
While others crawl away
Hold my hand baby don't let go
I've got some front money
And I've got a next show
And I'm going to need you
Down this yellow brick road

This ain't nothing but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancing
Without the sound
It ain't nothing no nothing
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're going to climb
Pat on the back 'n' better luck next time
It ain't nothing no it ain't nothing but a heartbreak town

A little time is all it takes

Back when we started
We didn't know how hard it was
Living on nothing
But what the wind would bring to us
Now we've got something
I can imagine fighting for
So why is fighting all that we're good at anymore

And sometimes I don't have the energy
To prove everybody wrong
And I try my best to be strong
But you know it's so hard
It's so hard

It's so hard when it doesn't come easy
It's so hard when it doesn't come fast
It's so hard when it doesn't come easy
It's so hard

It felt like a given
Something a woman's born to do
A natural ambition
To see a reflection of me and you
And I'd feel so guilty
If that was a gift I couldn't give
And could you be happy
If life wasn't how we pictured it

And sometimes I just wanna wait it out
To prove everybody wrong
And I need your help to move on
'Cause you know it's so hard
It's so hard

It's so hard when it doesn't come easy
It's so hard when it doesn't come fast
It's so hard when it doesn't come easy
It's so hard

I can live for the moment
When all these clouds open up for me to see
And show me a vision
Of you and me swimming peacefully
Last night you told me
That you can't remember
How to feel free

It's so hard when it doesn't come easy
It's so hard when it doesn't come fast
It's so hard when it doesn't come easy, easy
Whoa, whoa
It's so hard

Came into this world, daddy's little girl
Daddy made a soldier out of me (Ooh)
Daddy made me dance, Daddy held my hand
And Daddy liked his whiskey with his tea

We rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
That's when he gave to me

With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
Hе told me when he's gonе here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

Ooh

Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said, "Girl, it's your second amendment" (Ooh)
He always played it cool, but Daddy was no fool
And right before he died, he said, "Remember"

Watch out for your sister"
That's when Daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

Oh
Oh
I think, I think
I think, I think
Hey

My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you" (Ooh)
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you" (Ooh)
'Cause when trouble comes in town and men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
'Cause when trouble comes to town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
(Good job, Bey)

[Song 58: More Love]
5 ContributorsMore Love Lyrics
I'm so close to you baby but I'm so far away
There's a silence between us and there's so much to say
You're my strength, you're my weakness, you're my faith, you're my doubt
We gotta meet in the middle to work this thing out

More love
I can hear our hearts cryin'
More love
I know that's all we need
More love
To flow in between us
To take us and hold us
And lift us above
If there's ever an answer
It's more love

We're afraid to be idle
So we fill up the days
We run on the treadmill
Keep slavin' away
'Til there's no time for talkin'
'Bout trouble in mind
And the doors are all closed
Between your heart and mine

More love
I can hear our hearts cryin'
More love
I know that's all we need
More love
To flow in between us
To take us and hold us
And lift us above
If there's ever an answer
It's more love


Just look out around us
People fightin' their wars
They think they'll be happy
When they've settled their scores
Let's lay down our weapons
That pulled us apart
Be still for just a minute
Try to open our hearts

More love
I can hear our hearts cryin'
More love
I know that's all we need
More love
To flow in between us
To take us and hold us
And lift us above
If there's ever an answer
It's more love
I can hear our hearts cryin'
More love
I know that's all we need
More love
To flow in between us
To take us and hold us
And lift us above
If there's ever an answer
It's more love

More love

3 ContributorsBaby Hold On Lyrics
Hey
It might never be the same
We might never live those days gone by
But we can try

Mornin'
Let's kick the babies out of bed
How 'bout you and me instead, hangin' on
Not up and gone

(Baby, hold on)
Let's start this over
(Baby, hold on)
We're not much older now
(Baby, hold on)
If you still see what I see
Keep holdin' on
Hold on to me

Baby
It's good to see you smile again
I know we can't escape, so let's pretend
We're someplace else

It's a new day
Let's look at all we've got
It's everything we thought we ever wanted
It's beautiful

(Baby, hold on)
Let's start this over
(Baby, hold on)
We're not much older now
(Baby, hold on)
If you still see what I see
Keep holdin' on
Hold on to me

I look across the room and catch you starin' at me
And see the love we almost left behind
So lead me by the hand and let's make up
Let's make up for lost time, whoa

(Baby, hold on)
Let's start this over
(Baby, hold on)
We're not much older
(Baby, hold on)
If you still see what I see
Keep holding on
(Baby, hold on)
Hold on to me
(Baby, hold on)
Just hold on to me
(Baby, hold on)
Hold on to me
Keep holding on

Hey
It might never be the same
We might never live those days gone by

5 ContributorsNever Say Die Lyrics
Lyin' next to you in the dark
I can feel your beating heart
You've been here beside me through the test of time
We've both had our share of doubts
Waited out those old storm clouds
Boy, it's nights like this that I know why

Lovers like you and me will never say die

'Cause there's a long line of folks givin' up on love
So many hearts get broken in the push and shove
I'll believe in you for the rest of my life
Baby, lovers like you and me will never say die

Tears of joy and tears of pain
Tears say more than words explain
There's no need for words here tonight
We've both felt each other's power
A tender touch in the wee small hours
Is strong enough to hold us for a lifetime

Lovers like you and me will never say die

'Cause there's a long line of folks givin' up on love
So many hearts get broken in the push and shove
I'll believe in you for the rest of my life
Baby, lovers like you and me will never say die

Oh, lovers like you and me will never say die

So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you
Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passing through
So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you

When I don't feel like company
You make yourself at home
Even though you know
I'd rather be alone
Love walked out on me
And didn't even close the door
Next thing I know I'm staring
At your shadow on the floor

So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you
Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passing through
So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you

I wish that I could say it's nice
To see you back again
We're not exactly strangers
But we're not exactly friends
You know you're not invited but
You keep on coming 'round
The last thing that I need is you
To kick me when I'm down

So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you
Come in and wear your welcome out
The way you always do
You never say if you're here to stay
Or only passing through
So hello, Mr. Heartache
I've been expecting you

I've been expecting you
I've been expecting you
I've been expecting you

Let's just say we will and then don't instead

Wild goose chase
Wild goose chase
You're going to take me boy on a wild goose chase
You're going to take me boy on a wild goose chase
You better find somebody to take my place

You took my imagination and stomped it into ground
Now I can only think about you
Chasing the tracks that you left around

Hole in my head
Hole in my head
I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
You make me feel so bad that I wish I was dead

Let the games begin
I'm never going to win

It must have knocked me crazy
It must have hit me hard
People must think I'm lazy
Like my shuffle's short
Of playing a card

Wild goose chase
Wild goose chase
I need a boy like you like a wild goose chase
I need a boy like you like a wild goose chase
You better find somebody to take my place

Let the games begin
Yeah here I go again

I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)
I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)
I need a boy like you
Like a hole in my head
Hole in my head
Hole in my head

Hole in my head
Like a hole in my head
I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)
I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)

[Song 63: West Texas Wind]
2 ContributorsWest Texas Wind Lyrics
It's a long thin line, it sure is a hot and dusty day
And Colorado is more than eight hundred miles away
I called to tell you that I'd be home sometime tonight
If the roads are clear and the weather is right
Now to say I miss you is putting it lightly, can't you see
There's nothing better than having you lying next to me
Early in the morning, honey you're the first thing on my mind
Like a rising sun to the travelin' kind

West Texas Wind, tell me why you try to hold me back
Tuggin' at my heart and pullin' on my sleeve
You and this old guitar, you're always up for pickin' just one more song
And if I listen long enough to you I might never leave

Now the lights of Denver, they're gonna shimmer in the deep red of the dawn
And I'll be rollin' in, bleary-eyed and hangin' on
And I'll grab my suitcase and slip it lightly through the door
And swear again I won't leave him anymore

West Texas Wind, tell me why you try to hold me back
Tuggin' at my heart and pullin' on my sleeve
You and this old guitar, you're always up for pickin' just one more song
And if I listen long enough to you I might never leave

And if I listen long enough to you I might never leave
If I listen long enough to you I might never leave

Well, I told you, pretty baby
Such a long time ago
If I found you with another
Well, I'd walk right out your door
Woah, you might call me crazy
There's one thing you should know
Oh, honey, if you want me to love
You've got to give it up or let me go

I know it's useless to be jealous
Couldn't tie you if I tried
When I'm thinkin' you're messin' around my back
Brings a pain that I just can't hide
Oh, baby, I've been true to you
And if I can make that sacrifice
Honey, you can do it too
Aww, play that guitar, Tommy


Well, you come home drunk and nasty
You won't tell me where you've been
Just when things are nice and sweet
You're goin' back out again
Why do you want to mess up a good thing?
I'm gonna find me another man
One that wants to give me everything

Aww, yeah, Emily needs to fire that thing



Well, I told you, pretty baby
Such a long time ago
If I found you with another
Well, I'd walk right out your door
Woah, you might call me crazy
One thing you should know
Oh, honey, if you want me to love
You've got to give it up or let me go
Give it up now, y'all


Give it up or let me go

3 ContributorsPast the Point of Rescue Lyrics
Last night I dreamed you were back again
Larger than life again, holding me tight again
Placing those same kisses on my brow
Sweeter than ever now, Lord, I remember how
Couldn't get enough of kissing
Do you know how much I'm missing?
No you don't, but I do
Days like a slow train trickle by
Even the words that I write, refuse to fly
All that I can hear is your song haunting me
Can't get the melody out of my head you see
Distractions I've been using
Do you know how much you're losing?
No you don't, but I do
I do And I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do?
I never meant to push or shove you
Do you know how much I love you?
No you don't, but I do

[Song 66: Tortured, Tangled Hearts]
5 ContributorsTortured, Tangled Hearts Lyrics
Well there was a little falter at the altar of confession
Down on its knees true love did fall
After 31 days of sleepless nights, she woke up to end it all
With "I love you" on a fresh tattoo engraved upon his chest
She tore her name right off his heart
So here's to the unblessed

Oh love, oh love you fickle thing
Such pretty words and golden rings
It was a broken dream right from the start
Bless their tortured, tangled hearts

Well a blast of confusion coupled with delusion
Makes the best made plans sometimes fail
They wined and they dined, had peace of mind
She bought a gown and he rented tails
But the mighty cloud of destiny came drifting through the gates
And busted up what could have been a perfect, hopeless case
 x2
Oh love, oh love you fickle thing
Such pretty words and golden rings
It was a broken dream right from the start
Bless their tortured, tangled hearts

[Song 67: Favorite Year]
3 ContributorsFavorite Year Lyrics
We were young and so inspired
We weren't the only ones who thought
We'd change the world
No sun would set without us
No one we knew could ever doubt us
We had our future figured out
We knew a love like ours would always save the day
And that we'd always be ok

But would you know me now
Would you lay me down beside you?
Tell me everything I want to hear
Like that was your favorite year
Like that was your favorite year

You looked at me like no one else
But sometimes love just doesn't seem to conquer all
We search for someone else to blame
But sometimes things can't stay the same

But would you know me now
Would you lay me down beside you?
Tell me everything I want to hear
Like that was your favorite year
Like that was your favorite year

Holding on to the memories
Of when we were younger
I can't forget
'Cause when we were together
That's when I was at my best

But would you know me now
Would you lay me down beside you
Tell me everything I want to hear
Like that was your favorite year
Like that was your favorite year

3 ContributorsI Want to Be a Cowboy’s Sweetheart Lyrics
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
I want to learn to rope and ride
I want to ride over the plains and deserts
Out west of the Great Divide
I want to hear the coyotes howling
While the sun sets in the west
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
The life I love the best
I want to ride old Paint, going on a run
I want to feel the wind in my face
A thousand miles from all the city lights
Go at a cowhand's pace
I want to pillow my head near the sleeping herd
While the moon shines down from above
I want to strum my guitar, yodel-lay-ee-oo
That's the life I love
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
I want to learn to rope and ride
I want to ride over the plains and deserts
Out west of the Great Divide
I want to hear the coyotes howling
While the sun sets in the west
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
The life I love the best

[Song 69: I’ve Only Got Myself to Blame]
2 ContributorsI’ve Only Got Myself to Blame Lyrics
Hot night tonight, I've got a fever in my bones
I don't know what it is that drives me so far away from home
But I've walked the white line til the time that I cannot stand no more
Then I take my boots off and I lay down on the floor

And if you find me by the roadside
Don't be afraid to call my name
And if I seem a bit uneasy
You know that I've only got myself to blame
You know that I've only got myself to blame

Walking down the road I want to fade into the night
I know I've seen a darker day but have I seen the light
All alone a country song that's burning in my head
I've turned my back on better days but tonight I'll stay in bed

And if you find me by the roadside
Don't be afraid to call my name
And if I seem a bit uneasy
You know that I've only got myself to blame
You know that I've only got myself to blame

Well I turn my head up to the sky and it's down the road I go
I'd tell you where I'm going but it's truly I don't know
And I don't look for no affection, I've always gone alone
When you see me coming home you'll know I'll soon be gone

And if you find me by the roadside
Don't be afraid to call my name
And if I seem a bit uneasy
You know that I've only got myself to blame
You know that I've only got myself to blame

Some people think I'm crazy
But try to understand
I get satisfaction
Out of everything I can
The losers and the winners
The laughter and the tears
The noises of the day to day
Is music to my ears
And I like it
Yeah I like it, whoa

Gonna live it up this time
And dance like this song is never ending
Gonna get so high tonight
You won't be able to bring me down
Cause I like it
Yeah, I like it

Driving down the highway
The wind is in my hair
And if I hit a traffic jam
I swear that I won't care
Living the lows
Makes the highs that much higher
And the sun will shine through
The smoke and fire of love, love
Whoa, love
Whoa

Gonna ride this merry go 'round
And dance like the night is never ending
Gonna get so high all night
You won't be able to bring me down
'Cause I like it
Yeah, I like it
Oh baby, I like it
Whoa, oh, I like it

A sea couldn't wash away
The happiness I've come to find since love
Has taught me how to break
Break these chains that hold me back
Noisy streets and the sleepy bars
And the neon signs and the rusty cars
How many nights have I wondered how
One goes through life without seeing the beauty of love?
Whoa, the beauty of love, whoa

Gonna live it up in this town
And dance like this song is never ending
Gonna get so high tonight
You won't be able to bring me down
And I like it (I get so high)
Yeah, I like it (I get so high)

Whoa, baby, I like it
Oh, yeah, I like it
I like it
(I get so high)Whoa, I like it, baby
(I get so high)

(I get so high)
Whoa, I like it, whoa yeah

[Song 71: Travelin’ Soldier - Acoustic]
1 ContributorTravelin’ Soldier - Acoustic Lyrics
Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said, "would you mind sitting down for a while and talking to me? I'm feeling a little low"
She said "I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go"

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said, "I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?"

I cried
Never gonna hold thе hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for thе love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said, "When it's getting kinda rough over here
I think of that day sitting down at the pier
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile
Don't worry, but I won't be able to write for a while"

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said, "Folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead?"
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter said a soldier's coming
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter said a soldier's coming home

There was going to be that someone waiting for me

Nothing I could do, oooh

It was the easiest thing I ever had to do
Lay down my heart, lay down yours too
Spend all my life not knowing who, oooh

Now I need you more than ever to hold and touch
Your hand in mine

I can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

Now I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
These precious words keep me hangin' on

To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
Keep on waitin' (for that day)
But it ain't easy yeah

I grew up on Bob Wills and daydreams
My toes were a-tappin' to western swing
I wished upon a star
Atop an old boxcar
Chasing rainbows to the place the bluebirds sing
I painted my eyes up like Dolly
Sang with Kitty Wells 'til momma screamed
Then daddy shook his head as he carried me to bed
And tucked me in a-begging me to sing:

Thank Heavens for Dale Evans
You're everything I ever want to be
Yodel-lay-ee, Yodel-lay-ee
Yodel-lay-ee
Dale Evans made a cowgirl out of me

Now I play my guitar with the cowgirls
And what I got they never bat an eye
Like Shirley Temple's curls
Thank heavens for the girls
We'll sing a song to make a cowboy cry
I never got the limo or the diamond
But I got my hat, my boots and my guitar
I'm proud enough to say
I'll always be this way
Like the girl who went and stole Roy Roger's heart

Thank Heavens for Dale Evans
You're everything I ever want to be
Yodel-lay-ee, Yodel-lay-ee

No waiting to see, if it's right for me
No doubting your eyes, no watching you cry
No turning to run and no loving for fun
No holding it in, I'm falling again

So please, don't say you won't take me back again
Because time away won't be time better spent

I'm falling again, right back where I've been

Some days rock and some days roll
And some seem to last forever
Some days it's all you want
And some days it never never
Won't you tell me why
Things couldn't be a little easier
Some days everything is cool
And some days I can't get it together

'Cause there's a thin line, yeah
Between wrong and right, between black and white
It's been a long time, yeah
Since I could close my eyes and see the light
And there's some sunshine, baby
Shining down on me and it's all I need
To see the thin line, between me and you and you and me

How do things get so messed up
And seem so out of control
It's time to wake up, make our minds up
Time to get out of this hole
Won't you tell me why
It's as easy as you let it be
It's so hard to see the other side
When you won't let go of what you think you know

Because there's a thin line, yeah
Between wrong and right, between black and white
It's been a long time, yeah
Since I could close my eyes and see the light
And there's some sunshine, baby
Shining down on me and it's all I need to see
The thin line between me and you and you and me

Don't look so sad
Let's see if we can find
A way to make things right between us
And while we can't change each other's minds
We'll pick each other up again every time

And there's a thin line, yeah
Between wrong and right, between black and white
It's been a long time, yeah
Since I could close my eyes and see the light
There's some sunshine, baby

To see the thin line between me and you and you and me

Between wrong and right, between black and white
It's been a long time, yeah
Since I could close my eyes and see the light
There's some sunshine, baby
Shining down on me and it's all I need
To see the thin line between me and you and you and me
Because it's a mighty thin line

He said "I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?"

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says "a soldier's coming home"

So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said "when it's getting kinda rough over here
I think of that day sitting down on the pier
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while"

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said 'folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead"
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

[Song 78: Stand By Your Man]
3 ContributorsStand By Your Man LyricsSometimes its hard to be a woman
Giving all your love to just one man
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times
Doing things you don't understand
But if you love him
Please forgive him
Even though hes hard to understand
And if you love him, oh be proud of him
'cause after all hes just a man
Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When the nights are cold and lonely
Stand by your man
And show the world you'll love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man
And if you love him
Oh be proud of him
'cause after all hes just a man
Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When the nights are cold and lonely
Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
And keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man

[Song 79: Pink Toenails]
2 ContributorsPink Toenails Lyrics
Pink toenails, why don't I have time to paint pink toenails?
I've got my pink foam curlers and my pony-tail
My girlfriends have time for their pink toenails
Come nightfall, you'll be waltzing through my door
When you hear me call and I love the way you say
"I'm your baby doll" and you'll find me sitting there
In my pink toenails
I've got my Walkman and my Cosmo and my ticket to ride
All I need is my box of chocolates and you here by my side
Whoa, pink toenails, why don't I have time to paint pink toenails?
I've got my pink foam curlers and my pony-tail
My girlfriends have time for their pink toenails
You think your man don't care about perfume and powder
Polish and lipstick and lotion, lotion but when you slip
Your slippers off and you rub him on the chin and he looks down
Your leg, you're sure to see a grin at your pink toenails
He says, "Honey, come on over here and give me something sweet
Well, let me put my finishing touches on, put them on
Because I don't want to cuddle, snuggle, rubbing on my feet
Till I have painted every little toenail pink"
Oh, wrestle with me, you can mess up my hair
You can treat me like a tomboy, I love it I swear
Oh toenails, toenails
Why don't I have time to paint my toenails, toenails?
I've been drinking my whiskey from a holy grail, holy grail
And we'll go to Disneyland and ride the mono-rail, mono-rail
And if you're sweet, I'll be your nightingale, nightingale
Until the extinction of the sperm whale, sperm whale
Live happily after just like Roy and Gail, Roy and Gail

[Song 80: Little Ol’ Cowgirl]
2 ContributorsLittle Ol’ Cowgirl Lyrics
She's a little old cowgirl from out Texas way
Counting the nights until the fiddler plays
Working all week just doing her thing
She likes punching doggies but she loves to swing

And when she hears that back-beat rhythm drifting through the door
She can't talk, she can't sit still, she can't stay off of that floor
Kicking her heels up lordly look at her twirl
Everybody wants to boogie on down
With the little old cowgirl

She's got skin tight blue jeans, a big Stetson hat
Knee high boots well how about that
That rodeo buckle sure does shine
She cuts a two-step in a travelling line

And when she hears that back-beat rhythm drifting through the door
She can't talk, she can't sit still, she can't stay off of that floor
Kicking her heels up lordly look at her twirl
Everybody wants to boogie on down
With the little old cowgirl

So listen up cowboy, here's a little advice
Before you make your move son you'd better think twice
Because she don't stop and she won't go
Until they bring that house down with the cotton-eyed Joe

And when she hears that back-beat rhythm drifting through the door
She can't talk, she can't sit still, she can't stay off of that floor
Kicking her heels up lordly look at her twirl
Everybody wants to boogie on down
With the little old cowgirl

[Song 81: Irish Medley]
2 ContributorsIrish Medley Lyrics
I wish I were in Dublin or some other seaport town
I'd set my foot on a steamboat and sail the ocean 'round
Sailing 'round the ocean, sailing 'round the sea
I think of handsome Molly wherever she may be
I am a beggar-man and a begging I have been
For three score or more on this little isle of green
I'm known from the Liffy on down to Segu
And I'm known by the name of Little Johnny Doo
Of all the trades a-going sure a-begging is the best
When a man gets tired he can lay his head to rest
He can beg for his supper when there's nothing else to do
Or go sit 'round the corner in his old rigadoo
We slept one night in a barn in Clairebon
We went naked all night and slept until the dawn
Holes in the roof and the rain a-pouring through
And the cats and the rats they were a-playing peek-a-boo
Who should awaken but the woman of the house
In a white spotted apron and a calico blouse
She began to frighten and I said "Boo!"
"Don't be afraid ma'am, it's only Johnny Doo!"
Over the fields with a pack on my back
Over the hills with a creak in me sack
Holes in my shoes and my toes peeking through
Singing "Shinkle and a wrinkle it's only Johnny Doo!"
Well, it's getting late at night and it's time to go to bed
And the fire's all out and whoops goes the light
Now you know the story of the old rigadoo
So good night and God be with you says Little Johnny Doo

[Song 82: Mississippi]
2 ContributorsMississippi Lyrics
Every step of the way we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is pilin’ up, we struggle and we scrape
All boxed in, nowhere to escape

City’s just a jungle; more games to play
I'm trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
I was raised in the country, been workin’ in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

I got nothin' for you, I had nothin' before
Don’t even have anything for mysеlf anymore
Sky full of fire, and the rain is pourin’ down
Thеre's nothing you can sell me, so I’ll see you around

All my powers of expression and thoughts too sublime
Could never do you justice no reason or rhyme
Well there's only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Devil's devil’s in the alley, mule’s kickin' in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I heard it all
I was thinkin’ 'bout the things that you said
I was dreaming I was sleepin' in your bed

Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees
Well, so many things we never will undo
I know you’re sorry, oh I’m sorry too and

Some people offer you their hand and some won’t
Last night I knew you, tonight I don’t
I need something strong to distract my mind
I’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind

Well I got here followin' the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
There's only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well my ship’s been split with splinters, it’s sinking' fast
I’m drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my eyeline's not moving, it’s light and it’s free
I’ve got nothing but affection for those who’ve sailed with me

Everybody moving if they ain’t already there
Everybody's got to move somewhere
Well, stick with me baby anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

My clothes are wet, they're tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is reckon to be kind
So give me your hand and say you’ll be mine

Emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
Yeah there's only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Yeah the only thing that I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Yeah the only thing that I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well he told me that he was tired of being good
And he told me that she don't treat him like she should
Well he told me when he'd be alone
He told me how long she'd be gone
I'm only human
He shouldn't-a told me that
Well she told me that her man was really fine
Makes her sorry that she doesn't have more time
Well she laughed and told me
How she gets a little bit just now and then
I'm only human
She shouldn't-a told me that

My doctor tells me I should get more exercise
My friends tell me to be alone is so unwise
I'm being good but I don't know for how long
Temptation is coming on strong

Well I told you that I saw him yesterday
Very sexy, more than that I cannot say
And just before I said goodbye I told him with a little sigh
I'm only human
I shouldn't-a told him that

My doctor tells me I should get more exercise
My friends tell me to be alone is so unwise
I'm being good but I don't know for how long

And just before I said goodbye I told him with a little sigh

[Song 84: Storm Out on the Sea]
2 ContributorsStorm Out on the Sea Lyrics
As a girl I watched the sailing ships
Like white birds on the sea
Their sails were wings that rode the wind
My heart longed to be free
I saw you standing by the sea
The beach was dark as death
But your hand was warm against my face
Your kiss was my life's breath

And loving you's like drowning in a storm out on the sea
Put your arms around me darling
Now and rescue me
And loving you's like drowning and I feel so far from home
Put your arms around me
And I'll never sail alone

You never said you'd stay with me
I never tied your hands
The way some frightened women do to keep their love on land
Where they can walk dry-footed
And never fear the tide
Or the moon upon the water
In their lover's arms they hide

And loving you's like drowning in a storm out on the sea
Put your arms around me darling
Now and rescue me
And loving you's like drowning and I feel so far from home
Put your arms around me
And I'll never sail alone

The rain upon my body beat me down upon the sand
And the clouds came low and lonely
Like lost sailors seeking land
Soon I learned that lovin' you means drowning in the sea
When you closed your arms against me
And you turned your back on me

And loving you's like drowning in a storm out on the sea
Put your arms around me darling
Now and rescue me
And loving you's like drowning and I feel so far from home
Put your arms around me
And I'll never sail alone
And loving you's like drowning in a storm out on the sea
Put your arms around me darling
Now and rescue me
And loving you's like drowning and I feel so far from home
Put your arms around me
And I'll never sail alone

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
No you can't stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I wеnt to the doctor and guess what he told mе?
Guess what he told me?
He said girl you better try to have fun
No matter what you do, but he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Song 87: Aunt Mattie’s Quilt]
3 ContributorsAunt Mattie’s Quilt Lyrics
Aunt Mattie bent a thousand times down the long black rows
Then battled with the angry weeds so little seeds could grow
Come summer Mattie pulled the snow from cruel and cutting bolls
She was patient pale and slender and was only eight years old
Round and round the spinning wheel beneath Aunt Mattie's boot
She recalled the soil and cotton seeds and summer's hopeful shoots
Two winters spun out summer's threads in rich and creamy folds
And she had a bolt of cotton cloth when she turned ten years old

If we bend and plant the seeds and tame the wicked weeds
If we let the sun and rain assist and simplify our needs
If we follow in the barefoot path of one persistent girl
We'll throw a healing quilt across an ever ailing world

Indigo and lavender made up Aunt Mattie's sky
Remembering her childhood days she made the rustic dye
The hour before the day would end it fed young Mattie's dream
She made indigo and lavender when she turned just fourteen

If we bend and plant the seeds and tame the wicked weeds
If we let the sun and rain assist and simplify our needs
If we follow in the barefoot path of one persistent girl
We'll throw a healing quilt across an ever ailing world

Aunt Mattie bends a thousand times down each patchwork row
Piece by piece and stitch by stitch in fading candle glow
The valley of the shadow cannot call her from her seams
Until finishing her lifetime's work she dies at seventeen

If we bend and plant the seeds and tame the wicked weeds
If we let the sun and rain assist and simplify our needs
If we follow in the barefoot path of one persistent girl
We'll throw a healing quilt across an ever ailing world

Well you know how much you mean to me
And babe I know how much you really care
But when we talk about eternity
Forever seems to be too much for you to bear
Put your faith in my heart
And tell me you could be mine

Just a minute of your time
I'll pull you closer until I make you mine
If you really love me let's start today
Our love is only one heart away

You say that you've been burned by the flame
And that you're never going to try love again
But there's just one thing that I need to say
For you to think of me as more than just your friend
When I look in your eyes
I see your heart in mine

Just a minute of your time
I'll pull you closer until I make you mine
If you really love me let's start today
Our love is only one heart away

I don't know what your heart's been thinking
I only know that mine really needs you
We've been together long enough to know
We should just hold on

Just a minute of your time
I'll pull you closer until I make you mine
If you really love me let's start today
Our love is only one heart away
Just a minute of your time
I'll pull you closer until I make you mine
If you really love me let's start today
Our love is only one heart away

2 ContributorsLong Roads Lyrics
Where have I known you before?
Seems like lifetimes, maybe more
Our time together goes so fast
And so slowly when that time has past

I want to walk on the long roads with you
Love These days it's all that I can think of
And the love runs so deep, these nights
I can't even sleep
I want to walk on the long roads with you

I have a place where we can quench our thirst
But we'll have to swim an ocean, climb a mountain first
The mountains high, the valleys wide
Oh just sit back and enjoy the ride

I want to walk on the long roads with you
Love These days it's all that I can think of
And the love runs so deep, these nights
I can't even sleep
I want to walk on the long roads with you

Behind us the road is fading fast
While in front of us a light shines that says the fate's been cast
And the road we now must climb
Comes so easily one step at a time

I want to walk on the long roads with you
Love These days it's all that I can think of
And the love runs so deep, these nights
I can't even sleep
I want to walk on the long roads with you

There goes my dream
Walking down the street
With somebody new

No more of this loneliness

He will never know
What he means to me
There goes my dream

I was dreaming of family
Of him growing old with me
Sharing the memories
Of a wonderful life

There goes my dream
Walking down the street

There goes my dream

He will never know
What he means to me
There goes my dream
I love him so
He will never know

The kids are playing in the sand
And my hair is nearly dry
Supper's on the table and there's promise in the sky
You're out there on your ginger mare
You're not praying, so I do
Not so much a prayer for rain
But a desperate prayer for you

Thunderheads blow across the mesa
Like a heartless lover's lie
Thunderheads across the mountains
As another dream goes by
They glow like clouds from heaven
But the devil has to have his way
Thunderheads will bring you to your knees
And make you pray for a rainy day

I know you can't admit it
That you've lost and nature's won
That thunderheads will blow away
Across the dying sun
So don't try to tell me darling
How your heart's lost to the land
I don't need your explanations
I just want to hold your hand

Thunderheads blow across the mesa
Like a heartless lover's lie
Thunderheads across the mountains
As another dream goes by
They glow like clouds from heaven
But the devil has to have his way
Thunderheads will bring you to your knees
And make you pray for a rainy day

When it rains the dust will set
And we'll lie upon the sheets
We'll listen to the music on the roof
And fall asleep
We'll laugh again and love
Just like the years when we had rain
Then you'll feel the need to let me
Near your heart again

Thunderheads blow across the mesa
Like a heartless lover's lie
Thunderheads across the mountains
As another dream goes by
They glow like clouds from heaven
But the devil has to have his way
Thunderheads will bring you to your knees
And make you pray for a rainy day
Thunderheads blow across the mesa
Like a heartless lover's lie
Thunderheads across the mountains
As another dream goes by
They glow like clouds from heaven
But the devil has to have his way
Thunderheads will bring you to your knees
And make you pray for a rainy day

That's how I know, Hallelujah, I just love him so
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know he'll go with me until the end

And I tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four

In the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
He kisses me and he holds me tight
And tells me, "Pumpkin, everything's alright"
That's how I know, yes I know

When I call him on the telephone
And I tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four

Autumn leaves were paint in the water

Gently flowing past the trees
How I miss your tender kisses

Take me back to the Green River
Let my troubles roll on down
Take me when the leaves are falling
That's when my baby's love was still around

How I long for us to return

3 ContributorsA Road Is Just a Road Lyrics
He pulled out in a cloud of dust
Laying rubber and spewing rust
And on any road he'd take
He'd have his foot on the pedal but my heart on the brake
Underneath the smooth tar curves
A road is only dust and dirt
On a lonely interchange
The signs all look the same

Because a road is just a road
And a feelings just a feeling
No matter where you go
From Bakersfield to San Anton
A road is just a road
When the one you love is leaving on
And midnight's another dawn a hundred miles ago

He pulled out of sight of me
Believing that I'd set him free
But I'd heard the voice of the prisoner
Saying he couldn't get enough of her
You can go by land, you can go by air
Go by sea, hell, I don't care
You can go anyway you choose
Wearing out the soles of your travelling shoes

Because a road is just a road
And a feelings just a feeling
No matter where you go
From Bakersfield to San Anton
A road is just a road
When the one you love is leaving on
And midnight's another dawn a hundred miles ago

And every sleepless night
I see him screaming by the scenery
Not noticing another mile
That's rolled on between him and me

Because a road is just a road
And a feelings just a feeling
No matter where you go
From Bakersfield to San Anton
A road is just a road
When the one you love is leaving on
And midnight's another dawn a hundred miles ago

I was standing by the bedside of a sister
Who was just about to cross that swelling tide
And I asked her if she would do me a favour
And kindly take this message to the other side

Well, if you see my Saviour tell him that you saw me
And when you saw me I was on my way
You may meet some boyfriends who may ask about me
You tell 'em I am a coming home someday

I was standing by the bedside of a sister
Who was just about to cross that swelling tide
And I asked her if she would do me a favour
And kindly take this message to the other side

Well, you may have to make this journey on without me
Sooner or later, sooner or later it's a debt that must be paid
When you reach that goal that's when you'll think about me
But don't forget to tell my Saviour what I said

I was standing by the bedside of a sister
Who was just about to cross that swelling tide
And I asked her if she would do me a favour
And kindly take this message to the other side

And kindly take this message to the other side
And kindly take this message to the other side

I know you well, but we've never met
Always the same, always the safe bet
I know what's happening, I've seen it before
Uninvited, I'll be coming to your back door
Lock all your windows, hide under your bed
I hear you breathing, I know you're there
You can turn off the light
You can turn off your mind
You can shut me out
But I'll still be here
I'll still be here
You can turn me off and try to shut me down
But I'll still be here
You want to see things all the same
Why don't you see things in color for a change
I'm waiting and listening, trying to walk in your shoes
They walk a straight line, such a straight line
I'll drop my fences, if you drop your guard
Meet me on the front porch stop hiding in your backyard
Unlock your windows, come out from the bed
Your tv's glowing, I know you're there

You can turn it around
Til you like how it sounds
You can turn me off
But I'll still be here
I'll still be here
You can turn me down but I'll just shout it out
I'll still be here
Who did away with empathy
How do you love without sympathy
And who will be the one that still believes
It's the powerless who seem to fall
Between the cracks of those who have it all
And who's gonna be the one to speak for me
I'll still be here
I'll still be here
(repeats with Martie and Emily harmonies)
I'll still be here
When you like it or not
Oh I'll be here
(repeats with Martie and Emily harmonies)

Even when you're not
When you think I forgot
Come out in your backyard Monday
Let's meet on your front porch Friday
I'll still be here

[Song 97: Two of a Kind]
2 ContributorsTwo of a Kind Lyrics
On the road without a friend
Can make you feel life's loneliness
In a voice that rides the wind
Streaming 'cross the airwaves
In a simple country song
The one that you don't hear
Until the moon is full
It was Texas once again
The one about the good old boy
Who's caught remembering
Images of childhood
And the places that he'd been
Caught up in his questions
Wondering where it would end

Another midnight on the highway
Dallas in the distance
Seems I'm always leaving love behind
Singing along with someone
Who's soul is on the radio
Sounds like me and the good old boy
Are two of a kind

Bedding down in a cheap motel
Puts you in touch with an emptiness
That players know too well
It comes on strong when you drop your boots
And sit up on the bed
And try to keep your thoughts from dancing
Around the room
So you fumble with a line
Until you hear that melody
Singing sad and sweet
And there you are again with him
Somewhere down the line
You're feeling just a little bit better
When you hear his guitar whine

Another midnight on the highway
Dallas in the distance
Seems I'm always leaving love behind
Singing along with someone
Who's soul is on the radio
Sounds like me and the good old boy
Are two of a kind

[Song 98: Planet of Love]
2 ContributorsPlanet of Love Lyrics
I've found a new planet
That only I can see
Just came back to get you
Let's leave this misery
Nothing can reach us
So far from harm's way
Only sunshine
And rainbows every day
We've got to get back there
Hurry up and get your things
The countdown has started
Go ahead, try on these wings
Don't need no spaceship
For what I'm thinking of
Didn't I tell you
That I'd take you
To the planet of love
I got tired of losing
But now I'm in control
So help me start packing
We don't have far to go
I found a new planet
Don't revolve around the sun
We'll make a new start there
The journey's just begun
Won't get into trouble
In our new world so far above
Didn't I tell you
That I'd take you
To the planet of love
Didn't I tell you
That I'd take you
To the planet of love

[Song 99: Something in the Air]
2 ContributorsSomething in the Air Lyrics
Call out the instigators
Because there's something in the air
We've got to get together sooner or later
Because the revolution's here
And we know it's right
And we know that it's right
We have got to get it together
We have got to get it together now

Unlock the streets and houses
Because there's something in the air
We've got to gеt together sooner or latеr
Because the revolution's here
And we know it's right
And we know that it's right
We have got to get it together
We have got to get it together now

Lock up the arms and ammo
Because there's something in the air
We've got to get together sooner or later
Because the revolution's here
And we know it's right
And you know that it's right
We have got to get it together
We have got to get it together now

[Song 100: Who Will Be the Next One]
2 ContributorsWho Will Be the Next One Lyrics
I always wanted true love but somehow I've always failed
To find the man who'll always go my bail
As I look across the room tonight I wonder helplessly
If the man I need is looking back at me

I wonder who will be the next one
That next man who'll sweep me off my feet
I wonder if he'll be the last one for me
Will he break my heart or love me tenderly

I hope someday I find the man who'll give my heart a break
Always want me near and crave the love we make
Now will he be a friend of mine or maybe someone new
I'm so lonely Lord, I only wish I knew

I wonder who will be the next one
That next man who'll sweep me off my feet
I wonder if he'll be the last one for me
Will he break my heart or love me tenderly
I wonder who will be the next one
That next man who'll sweep me off my feet
I wonder if he'll be the last one for me
Will he break my heart or love me tenderly

[Song 101: A Heart That Can]
2 ContributorsA Heart That Can Lyrics
You say I've done a lot of good
You're glad I found you when I did
But I wonder why you keep
Those questions in your head
Oh I think you're afraid to fall
Someone went and blew the call

All I can say is my heart tries hard
Try as hard as I can
You'll never find that my love falls short
One day you'll understand
That I've got a heart that can

Well I think I know by now
I will be standing by your side
Taking in account true love's never shy
I can show you everyday
This is not a one act play

All I can say is my heart tries hard
Try as hard as I can
You'll never find that my love falls short
One day you'll understand
That I've got a heart that can

So let me love you the best
That I know how
Let me move you with
Everything that love allows

All I can say is my heart tries hard
Try as hard as I can
You'll never find that my love falls short
One day you'll understand
That I've got a heart that can

[Song 102: The Thrill Is in the Chase]
2 ContributorsThe Thrill Is in the Chase Lyrics
Girls never like to know
Their love for him is true
Cause the nature of the beast
Says he wants to pursue
He wants what he cannot have
And he won't be outdone
Cause he'll always love the one that keeps him on the run

The thrill is in the chase
And I guess they know that too
Cause I've been running long and hard
And can't catch up to you
Girls if you think you've found true love
Keep your poker face
Cause I know better, the thrill is in the chase

If he's far, far away
Don't call him on the phone
Never let him know
You spend some nights alone
I can tell you one thing more
That I've found to be true
That he'll always love the one that makes him blue

The thrill is in the chase
And I guess they know that too
Cause I've been running long and hard
And can't catch up to you
Girls if you think you've found true love
Keep your poker face
Cause I know better, the thrill is in the chase

Girls if you think you've found true love
Keep your poker face
Cause I know better, the thrill is in the chase
Cause I know better, the thrill is in the chase

[Song 103: Rider]
3 ContributorsRider Lyrics
I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby from rolling in your arms

The sun is going to shine on my backdoor someday
The sun is going to shine on my backdoor someday
Well, I know a March wind's goingto carry my blues away

I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby from rolling in your arms

I wish I was a headlight on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight on a northbound train
Well, I'd shine my light through the cold Colorado rain

I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby from rolling in your arms
I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby from rolling in your arms

[Song 104: Just a Bit Like Me]
2 ContributorsJust a Bit Like Me Lyrics
It's six o'clock in the morning
The sun was ready to rise
And as she closes his lunchbox
She spies the sun in his eyes
She stays at home with the baby
She's got a dream in her heart
Somewhere her sister is singing
A night is ready to start

One's choosing, one's cruising
Down the highway of their dreams
While songs are sung her dream's begun
And she thinks of what it means
To live through her voice, she made a choice
But neither one is free
Am I a lot like her or is she just a bit like me?

It's three o'clock in the morning
I got an ache in my head
I throw my clothes in the corner
Then sleep alone in my bed
Tomorrow, we'll go to Texas
I hear it's sunny back home
There ain't no use in pretending
I know that I gotta roam

One's choosing, one's cruising
Down the highway of their dreams
While songs are sung her dream's begun
And she thinks of what it means
To live through her voice, she made a choice
But neither one is free
Am I a lot like her or is she just a bit like me?

She puts her cans in the pantry
I read my name in the news
She spends her days sewing curtains
I feel there's no time to lose
Well it's a long way to Nashville
But then the garden is dry
If we could do it all over
Would we still be satisfied?

One's choosing, one's cruising
Down the highway of their dreams
While songs are sung her dream's begun
And she thinks of what it means
To live through her voice, she made a choice
But neither one is free
Am I a lot like her or is she just a bit like me?

[Song 105: Desire]
2 ContributorsDesire Lyrics
Last night I took a turn I never should
I knew nothing good would come of this
Morning's come now and the smoke has cleared
How did I get here from a single kiss

I can't undo what's been done
When the web's already spun
I got caught up in desire
No matter what I say
I can't make it go away
The trouble's just begun
Can't undo what's been done

When I get home there will be hell to pay
I wish there was a way to ease the pain
In a heartbeat I could lose it all
Then my tears would fall, fall like pouring rain

I can't undo what's been done
When the web's already spun
I got caught up in desire
No matter what I say
I can't make it go away
The trouble's just begun
Can't undo what's been done
I can't undo what's been done
When the web's already spun
I got caught up in desire
No matter what I say
I can't make it go away
The trouble's just begun
Can't undo what's been done

No, I can't undo what's been done

[Song 106: She’ll Find Better Things to Do]
2 ContributorsShe’ll Find Better Things to Do Lyrics
She don't see no way around it
He shows every sign of leaving her behind
After three days staying out late
It don't look like he'll be coming home tonight
She wants to cry but pride won't let her
She'll find better things to do
Leaves her key inside the mailbox
With a note that tells that cowboy where to go
It's a two day drive to Denver
With a U-Haul if she doesn't take it slow
She wants to cry but pride won't let her
She'll find better things to do

Don't let Dallas see you crying
She reminds herself as she rolls out of town
When she hits that Texas border she sets pride aside
And lets her tears come down
Then she cries all the way to Colorado
Because it hurts like the devil to be free

Cuts her hair and finds a new job
And her friends all tell her girl you're doing fine
Still the nights get cold and lonely
When that wild west Texas cowboy haunts her mind
She wants to cry but pride won't let her
She'll find better things to do

Don't let Dallas see you crying
She reminds herself as she rolls out of town
When she hits that Texas border she sets pride aside
And lets her tears come down
Then she cries all the way to Colorado
Because it hurts like the devil to be free

[Song 107: Whistles and Bells]
3 ContributorsWhistles and Bells Lyrics
Whistles and bells won't ever bring you love and happiness
She's never going to give her heart the way that I would give
She's got you spinning round in circles, I can tell
With her lights, buzzers, whistles and bells

I see her running round this town in her fancy car
A girl who can't afford your hopes and dreams
But darling all those pretty toys won't help your broken heart
When she's through and sends you packing back to me

Whistles and bells won't ever bring you love and happiness
She's never going to give her heart the way that I would give
She's got you spinning round in circles, I can tell
With her lights, buzzers, whistles and bells

I cried those lonely tears until the day I realized
That you were hurting so much more than me
There are some things in this world that just don't have a price
Like the love that waits here for you patiently

Whistles and bells won't ever bring you love and happiness
She's never going to give her heart the way that I would give
She's got you spinning round in circles, I can tell
With her lights, buzzers, whistles and bells

She's got you spinning round in circles, I can tell
With her lights, buzzers, whistles and bells

Darling, you send me, darling, you send me
I know you send me, honest you do
Honest you do, honest you do
You thrill me, I know you thrill me
I know you thrill me, honest you do
Honest you do, honest you do

When at first I thought it infatuation
But now it's lasted so long and now
I find myself wanting to marry you
And take you home

Whoa, you send me, darling, you send me
I know you send me, honest you do
Honest you do, honest you do

When at first I thought it infatuation
But now it's lasted so long and now
I find myself wanting to marry you
And take you home
When at first I thought it infatuation
But now it's lasted so long and now
I find myself wanting to marry you
And take you home

1 ContributorThe Star-Spangled Banner (National Anthem) Lyrics
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave

You can't afford no ring
You can't afford no ring
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring

You finally took my hand
You finally took my hand
It took a nip of gin
But you finally took my hand

You can't afford no ring
You can't afford no ring
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring

Mama don't approve
Mama don't approve
Daddy says he's the best in town
And mama don't approve

You can't afford no ring
You can't afford no ring
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring

Baby's on its way
Baby's on its way
Say I do and kiss me quick
Because baby's on its way

I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring

[Song 114: Christmas Swing]
2 ContributorsChristmas Swing LyricsThe turkey in our radar range has roamed too far from home
We mailed our Christmas wishes in, now Santa's on his own
Momma wants some Tupperware, Daddy wants a Stetson
There's snow on all the prickly pear, the winter round-up's done
It's sleepytime for cowgirls, the night has just begun
And that ol' Lone Star shines bright down on every Texan
It's Christmastime in Texas
People go a caroling
Divinity 'n mistletoe
And sing-a-longs with Bing
But we rosin up the fiddle
And do the Christmas Swing
Laura wants some go-go boots, a slinky in her sock
And add a pearl for Robin and a wind-up Snoopy clock
Martie wants a Barbie, Emmy wants a rhinеstone ring
Santa's coming south to see us, his team of longhorn flying
Cowpokes know thеy best be good 'cuz Saint Nick may be spying
Let's two step, cowboy, to the Christmas Swing
So blow you ol' blue northern
And make the cowbells ring
From Abilene to Beaumont
Folks sing along with Bing
And if it snows in late December we don't care!
We'll do the Christmas Swing
