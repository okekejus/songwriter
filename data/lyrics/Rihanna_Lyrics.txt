You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been, mm
But I wake up and act like nothing's wrong

Long distance, I need you (Ah)
When I see potential, I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh (Yeah)
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I'm sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face-to-face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward

I come flutterin' in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you tried to
I come ridin' in on a pale white horse
Handin' out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you're breakin' it down for me
'Cause I can't hear you
Two times, run it on back
Will it ever make sense to me?

I got to do things my own way, darlin'
Will you ever let me?
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way, darlin'
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind, oh

Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it's seein' now
Ooh, darlin', would you mind givin' my reflection a break
From the pain it's feelin' now?

I got to do things my own way, darlin'
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way, darlin'
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind, oh
Get no peace
Get no peace
Get, get, gettin' no peace, oh
Get no peace
Get, g-get no peace, oh

Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pu-pu-pum, rum-pu-pu-pum, rum-pu-pu-pum

When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do if you're playing me for a fool?
I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ayy-uh

I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)

And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like

So how will I know I've gone too far?

And when you enter, you ain't leaving
Be my prisoner for the night, oh

Want you to make me feel
Like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one

Take me for a ride, ride
Oh, baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Oh, make it last all night, night
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh, baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Make it last all night

Want you to make me feel

Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world

Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't

I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now to be close to you

Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
But now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Well just let it go

I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close, if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
If you let me, I'd be there by now
Close to you

Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more

She describes the painful experience that she knows her boyfriend is going through as she is cheating on him.
Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Woah, anymore

And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

A murderer, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah

Baby, baby, when we first met
I never felt somethin' so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinkin'
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more

I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)

In a different way that I was using you

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? Oh-oh-oh-oh
What now?

I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Please tell me)
What now?

There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Somebody tell me)
What now?

I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why

Ooh
Oh

Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now

Ooh
Oh

A drug and a dream
A lost connection, oh, come back to me
So I can feel alive again
As soul and body try to mend

It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never-ending
I slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

Ghost in the mirror

"Te amo, te amo", she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then, we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

Then, she said, "Te amo"
Then, she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried, "Te amo"
I told her, "I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"
My soul is awry without askin' why
I said, "Te amo," wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
Don't it mean "I love you"?

"Te amo, te amo," she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and askin', "Why it's over?"

Then, she said, "Te amo"
Then, she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried, "Te amo"
I told her, "I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"

Don't it mean "I love you"?

Listen, we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night, I move under the light
Because I understand
That we all need love and I'm not afraid
I feel the love, but I don't feel that way, no

Then, she said, "Te amo"
Then, she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried, "Te amo"

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

I ask you, "What's the matter?"
You say "Oh, it's nothing at all."
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps"
And then I get a scary thought

Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

I'm wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart beating
No, woah, you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
Know that I must pass this test

Boy, you got it misunderstood
Put it in your face, but you actin' all scared
Like you can't recognize a good thing
Now that you got a chance, tell me, what it's gon' be?

You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered
Let the others know

If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and jump on it
If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and jump on it

You say it's my fault
Okay, I get it
You ain't pick up your calls
I'm like, "forget it"
See you put up your wall
You know you did it
The rise and the fall
Just admit it
You say it's my fault
Okay, I get it
You ain't answer your calls
I'm like, "forget it"
It's the the rise and the fall
It's the the rise and the fall
And you could have had it all

If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and jump on it
If you want it, let's do it

Like a waterfall, my tears dropped to the floor, the floor
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes, crimes
Oh, what could I do to change your mind?
Nothing

I'm bracing for the pain and I am letting go
I'm using all my strength to get out of this hole

I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer

Yeah I hit a wall, I prayed that I would make it through, make it through
I can survive a life that's without you, that's without you, yeah
And I will rise up from the ashes now, the ashes now
Oh, the sparrow flies with just the crumbs of loving spilled, yeah

I was bracing for the pain and then I let it go
I gathered all my strength and I found myself whole

I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall

I've been lookin' for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one, step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
'Cause I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)

I've got class like a '57 Cadillac
Got overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep sayin' that you will, boy, I wish you would

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here (Here)

Soon the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em "Give me back my swag," they tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames
Louis belt, what that make me, Louis Mane?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be to 'em

Where them girls talking trash? Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at? Where them bloggers at?

Must everything you do make me wanna smile (Uh)
Can I not like you for a while? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl, and then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden, I forget (That I was upset)
I can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

911, it's a critical emergency, yeah
Better run-run-run
Come and charge him with the 1-4-3, yeah
Told me this world was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now it's done, done, done
And his love is no more for me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fi-Fo-Fum, like the sky is falling down on me
Numb-numb-numb
He so cold, he doesn't feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Go on and put him away
He's the only one-one-one I ever let get the best of me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Usually I'm the one that they cry for
But this man, he's the one that I'd die for
Mama said there's no 'cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?
No love, no love, no love allowed

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?

Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Lost in the rock and roll
Got lost in a promise of a love I'd never know (Ooh)
Shadows chased me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold (Ooh)

And you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth my soul

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Lost my faith and trust
You and I know gold don't turn to rust (Ooh-ooh)
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays (Ooh-ooh)

Don't you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth my soul

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna run to, when you get to the edge of the night?
Its time you face the sky, ooh

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Oh, stupid in love, ooh

Let me tell you something
Never have I ever been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still, you insist on repeatedly tryin' to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid (Stupid in love)
I still love you but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid

My new nickname is "You Idiot" (Such an idiot)
Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when they see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me, "Let go, he is not the one"
I thought I saw your potential, guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
You're telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryin' to tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid (Stupid in love)
I still love you but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid

Tryin' to make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (Oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no
No, I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid (No, no), I'm not stupid (No, no, no)
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid (Like I'm stupid in love)
I still love you but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid

I may be dumb but I'm not stupid in love

Oh, it's rainin' men, girl, what you worried 'bout?

Who you think you getting with that "Hi, let me freak ya"?
You got me mistaken thinking you gon' get it easy
First of all, you need to know that I'm not the one
Think you gettin' somethin', baby, you ain't gettin' none
All you need to know that I'm a two times five
Load it, cock it, aim it, baby, boom bye-bye
Set your standards lower, boy, you're aimin' too high
Matter of fact, your friend looks better, so goodbye

Give me dome, dome, da-da-da-da-da-dome, dome, dome
I ain't trippin' on your money, money, long, long, long
Want my own TV production company
So tell Harpo to hit me, Celie
Anyway, RiRi, what rhymes with your name freely?
Money got you vacationing in Chile
Do you wanna sit on the back while I wheelie?
Really? Really? No, for real, really?
Laid out on the beach, they be feeding me my catfishes

Saw me on a television

But that's just the half of it
Yeah, you saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it

You saw me on a television
Hanging out my dirty linen
You're entitled to your own opinion
Sit and shake your head at my decisions
I guess the kind of songs that I've been singing
Make it seem as if I'm always winnin'
But you saw me on a television

[Song 69: Cry]
18 ContributorsCry Lyrics
I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got that whole "in love" thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing

My mind is gone, I'm spinnin' 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give it to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry (Cry, cry, cry)

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life (You'll never see me cry)
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
All my life

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone, and left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim

Patron on the brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

He's stayin' with a flock of 'em, oh yeah
Got a girl at home, but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks callin' the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more, yeah

He finds a letter on the stairs, sayin', "This is the end"
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

Mmh

Ask us where you at, we don't know

All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone, and left us all alone, no-oh-oh

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)

In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?

It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody told me how to mend
A broken-hearted soul
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
(With this heart, with this heart)
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise

Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Can see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
I wanna run wild in the middle of the night
Right under the moon, bodies glowing in the night
Nothing in between our skins but the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
The night-time is the right time

I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
Move move move
Dancing in the dark
I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
Move move move
Dancing in the dark

Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Out here with the stars like the creatures of the night
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
I wanna dance fast in the middle of the night
And see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
The night-time is the right time

I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
Move move move
Dancing in the dark
I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
Move move move

I wanna dance in the dark (come on)

I wanna dance in the dark (come on)

Dancing in the dark
I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
Move move move

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No

I feel like I'm a hopeless romantic
I can't help falling in love
I fiend for love
I want it, I crave it
I just can't get enough

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah

You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been let down
But never been tainted
So I'll stay thirsty for more
No, I won't hold back
No drop is wasted
I'll let love run its course

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah

You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I'm drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need

I'm so intoxicated
I love the way you taste on my lips, when we kiss
You got me so addicted
So much, I can't resist falling into your arms

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah

You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I'm drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need

I'd give my heart to this place
I'd give my soul or whatever it takes
Never run away
I've got enough angels to storm the gates
I'm not afraid
And behold the brave
Not have it no other away
I miss the emergence and these moments of you
The mere reflection of me
That mirror can't change its view

So until those rivers run out, it runs through me
Wherever you are, I'll bе there
We carry on
Born again

I'd givе my heart to this place (I'd give my heart to this place)
I'd give my whole soul and whatever it takes
Never run away
And I'd relive this just to see your face again
I know that you'd do the same
Born again

Just tell me what I need to do
I'd die and come back just to love you
Just tell me, I'm begging you
Just tell me what I need to do, oh

When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinkin' of everything that we've become
And I hate it, I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this, just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinkin' you were out with your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said, boy

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimmin' in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playin' when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses (Kisses) and my lovin' (And my lovin')
But ain't nobody better than us, yeah, yeah

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why you said

We ride (Mmm)
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die

When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know it's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride (Yeah)
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

Gonna make you say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness (Oh-oh, oh)
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference (Oh-oh, oh)
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes, couldn't see (No)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind that you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness (Oh-oh, oh)
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference (Oh-oh, oh)
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love  (Oh, oh, oh-oh)

We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough looking for a truth
That was here all along, no

A cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

You have my hands to hold
So how come you won't hold me?
Your words are so damn cold
The winter can't affect me
You're man enough to say
What you think is my business
But, you can't say you love me
Even in between the kisses

Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops falling in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

Your arms around me now
Felt like sunlight in the morning
It always comes around
But, just not when I want it
So all you have to give
Is everything I needed
But, it's so hard to live
Just wondering if you're giving

Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops falling in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

You'd rather make up a lie
Then make up a fight
And then you get so upset when I ask you why, oh
I wonder what makes you feel
A part of you can't be real
You said you'd never hurt me
Then, what do you think you did?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

There could be a fatal disease

But it's as real as you and me

We could all fall down
Before our savior could return
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me

If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling, cover me, please

The earth could quake to ruin
We could drift off in our sleep
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me
The ocean crushed the shore
And take us down forever more
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me

If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling cover me, please

I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me

Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it
Stadium gon' do the wave

You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up

It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over

Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over

Wait your turn

So you don't wanna wait?

'Cause if you play it sideways, ain't no timeout in my game
They already underway
I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold up

Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win

Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else, you're the only way I'll win
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn, I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
Babe, you're up
The time is now and now the wait is over

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn

Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he's quite a man
He adores me, he's my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong
I know he's not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he's flawless in mine

And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hold on my soul

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough

Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?

You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough

Wherever you're going

I don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought of you miles away

And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know It'll be sadder
If you never hit the road

So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me

I will write to tell you what's goin' on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day
Telling you stories about a land far away
But I know

And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life (Oh)
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road

So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell

And I'm gon' try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here, yeah

Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm goin'
I gotta get where I'm goin'
Take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing

Where I'm goin', I don't need my brakes (Brakes)
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh

Oh, oh

So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm comin' from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Seems cold, but baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful when it's through, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing

Where we're going, we don't need no brakes (Brakes)
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers needa clear the road

So I won't have to burn alone

They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
'Cause we were burning, the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you is to go out blazing

The lovers needa clear the road, oh, oh

When you hold me, I'm alive, we're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive

Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
But boy, you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

Now baby, it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better, babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely
Hey, hey, hey

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have, that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby, here's my heart
My heart, my heart

My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on, looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?

Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?

All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie

Love, oh
Mm

Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure release
I put in work, did more than called upon
More than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me
Before a decision, ask this question first

Who am I living for? Oh
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more? Oh
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for? Oh
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more? Oh
Chances I'm given, question existing

Take off my cool (Take off my cool)
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool
Or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause (Round of applause)
Take the abuse
Sometimes, it feels like they want me to lose (Want me to lose)
It's entertainment; is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether win or lose, is

Who am I living for? Oh
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more? Oh
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for? Oh
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more? Oh
Chances I'm given, question existing

Dear diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
This is not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh (Haha), I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
'Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

Who am I living for? Oh
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more? Oh

You upset me girl

Said I despise that I adore you

One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me (hmm)
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's how much I love you
As much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you
Oh, I need you
That's how much I need you
I need you
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you boy
I can't stand how much I need you
(I can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you boy
But I just can't let you go
(But I just can't let you go no)
And I hate that I love you so (Ohhh)
And I hate that I love you so so

Gimme shoes and gimme bags
How much you want? I need 'em bad

All them girls be checkin' my bags
While they be bitin' my swag
I guess they know I'm bad
Bad (Bad)

What a bad little girl I am (I got a problem, bad-bad)
What a bad little girl I am (I need you to solve it, bad-bad)

She buyin' everythin' up, man, I can't call it
And she a walkin' store, I'm talkin' 'bout her clothes
I just pause, I'm in awe, 'cause she a fashion show
Real Louis bags and breathe Gucci
Got a wardrobe like she's starin' in a movie
And she ain't even famous, but she got her own groupies
She got her own groupies
Said she got her own groupies (Bad)

What a bad little girl I am (I got a problem, bad-bad)

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, mm

What's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother? How's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line to the story of me and you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, you, you
(Still not over you)
You, yeah, mm

Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I woulda put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Like a silly joke or something on the TV
Boy, it ain't easy
When I hear our song, I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you, you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, you, you
(Still not over you) You, yeah, mm-mm

Did you know I kept all of your pictures?
Don't have the strength to part with them yet, oh no
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things, a girl can never forget

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, oh
(Still not over you)
Oh, I tried to forget you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better (Don't get no better)
As each day goes by (As each day goes by)
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose

Sell me candy like the summer when it's melting in my hands
I know you're around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
Sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear

I'm weak by your touch and when it's melting on my lips
A rush through my body, feel it in my fingertips
You selling me your fantasy that I wanna explore
Sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core (You know)

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If the words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me

Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
So what's the charge? What's the cost?
(I'm the daddy) You the boss

Could be a professional, boy, you make a sale
I try to resist, but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
You're running through my body, now you're knocking at my door

Forbidden little kiss and you call it bittersweet
But the shawty that you're rocking with ain't nothing like me
You selling me your fantasy that I wanna explore
Sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core (You know)

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If the words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me

Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
So what's the charge? What's the cost?
(I'm the daddy) You the boss

I want you, babe, more than you know
So don't you leave, and don't you go
I want it all, until time falls
These arms won't hold you wrong
I want your love, give you my trust
I wanna live for both of us
I wanna breathe ya, lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm ya, when nights get colder
I want love (Love), love (Love), love (Love)
I want love (Love), love (Love), love (Love)

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
If the words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me

Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
So what's the charge? What's the cost?

One spliff a day keep my mind right
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One-one spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil-evil away

One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away

I blow tree everyday in my house, in my car, I love to blaze
Got the best smoke on the west coast, in LA (that's right)
Smoking bomb-bomb going dum-dum
Screaming one love got my L up, bout to roll a blunt
Take a puff-puff of the diesel
Hit the plug up till I run us a kilo
I'm laid back in a Maybach blowing zeroes
Up to the ozone gripping my solo I'm so gone so long

I might just bring a gram to the Grammy's
I might cop it straight off the boat in Miami
If you ain't puttin' my nigga then we ain't passin'
Light up my troubles then watch them turn into ashes

One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One-one spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil-evil away

One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
You know I smoke so I can blow the pain away
And as you know
One spliff a day keep my mind right

Wake up in the morning then I pray to Jah
Please give me mercy fi the ganja
Know they gotta' smell this dime bag on this dimepiece
I might catch a charge if the copper search me
Not one, not two, not three, not four
Who the fuck these narcos at my door
They want war, they want war
I make green my decor
Imma let these motherfuckers know who da boss

I might just bring a gram to the Grammy's
I might cop it straight off the boat in Miami
If you ain't puttin' my nigga then we ain't passin'
Light up my troubles then watch them turn into ashes
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away
One-one spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil-evil away

One spliff a day keep da evil away
One spliff a day keep da evil away

Here we are
Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again, maybe we're finally on
The road that's headed away from all your complaining
Of hearing the same song
But baby, we'll hear it when I'm gone

It's time to turn on the last song
Oh-oh
The last song
Oh-oh

What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
It was ours
But I'd do it again, holding hands with my friend again
But then again, maybe we gave our all
A song we'll never forget
Baby let 'em play it, maybe it'll save the world
They gon' miss hearing it when it's gone

But it's time to turn on the last song
Oh-oh
The last song
Oh-oh

What if we left every moment that we could spare?
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
You'll never know when the songs gonna play
The last song you'll hear is the one you made
Your song was beautiful
That's why I started singing it
But this song is our song, it's playing 'til the end
Even if it's the last song

The last song
Oh-oh
The last song
Oh-oh

What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear

They all walk and talk and they dress the same
Nothing new to say (Nothing new to say)

It's so easy to see right through their disguise?
Makes me wonder why

When the whole world's turning left
Is when I'm going right

Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me

Can give me anything if I asked him to?
Would take all my dreams and to make them true
Show me all the reasons you oughta be, with a girl like me (Girl like me)

The possibility
Got me trippin', thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me (You and me)
Still, I need to know
Should I keep this feeling or let it go?
I can't wait no more
So now's the time to speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you wanna take a chance on something real

'Cause a girl like me (Girl like me), just a little different from all the rest (Woah-oh, oh-oh)
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best (Never gonna settle)

Always so strong and don't complain

So what are you tryna hide?
I know what that look means
You hold my hand so tightly
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door
I could tell you can't take no more
Blow your secret open wide

So maybe if you say it (Say it)
Tell me what it is you like (Like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy (Shy)
Maybe you can spend the night (Night)
If you say it
But if you playing (Not with it)
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (Hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (Clear)
I need to know how you feel
So baby, why won't you (Say it)
Say it (Say it)

Won't, won't you tell me

What you waiting for?
Soon you should tell me or I might be gone
But I'm here for you, baby
You should put me on

I won't shoot you down
Make you feel some kinda way
If you'll be honest with me
Put away your pride
I can see it in your face
You want me permanently (Uh)
Like how I whine when we dancing
I know how it happened
And I'm right there with you
But I won't be the first to put myself out there
The feeling is mutual
But I bet if you (Say it)

So maybe if you say it (Say it)
Tell me what it is you like (Like)

Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest

Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the six train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lotta game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to nine
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything
I know his crew's kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night, he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (So good to me)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him everything)
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now 'til forever
I know it's the real thing
If you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be (I know it's meant to be, I know it's meant to be)
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama? (How am I gonna tell my mama?)
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (Yeah)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him all of me)

It's been a minute since I saw you, boy
Must admit, it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again

Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried, but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep coming back
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again

Sweet lovin' is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss 'dem days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Negril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within'

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again
Baby, here I go again

Boy, I'm still in love with you, no matter what you do
We belong together forever

Here we lay, face to face once again
The silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding onto could have been's, that we should be letting go

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away, hey, yeah

Was it me? Or was it you that broke away?
From what we were
'Cause like the seasons, love is change
And every time I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion
But I got no more tears to cry

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
We both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, ooh-yeah
We can try to talk it over
But we've walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
Feels like you're a million miles away
Hey, yeah
A million miles away

I never should've waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
Mmm

Hold on me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside, the world wages its wars
I'll rest in peace as long as you know

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die

Promise you our love
Will carry on
Until you turn eternal
We belong

When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be when I look into your eyes?
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter, more like butter
Since I met you, boy, my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to a crazy little thing called love (Crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
Whoa, yeah

My best friends tell me "Rihanna, what's got into you?"
I said "LeAndra, I can't explain these feelings I'm going through"
They tell me "Girl, it's not like you to fall this way"
I try my best to wear a disguise, but it's written on my face

Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one (Maybe you're the one)
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum

And introduce you to the real type of loving where you oughta

My California king

Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So, how come when I reach out my finger, it feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets

So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (Oh yeah)
'Cause they only wanna know you and roll you
Only for the things you have
I just think it's so sad

Get dem haters out your circle (Haters)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (Bring you down, no, no)
Down (Down, yeah)
See dem try dem best to hurt you, they work you (Oh, they're gonna try)
Anything to bring you down
Down (Down)

They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (What you don't know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
After them not how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when you're on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Dem all gon' try fi take your life (Dem haters)

Get dem haters out your circle (Know they're gonna smile in your face)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (Bring you down)
Down
See dem try dem best to hurt you and work you (They try dem best, try dem best)
Anything to bring you down (To bring you down)

Down (Down, down, down)
See dem try dem best to hurt you, they work you (You know they try)
Anything to bring you down (Anything to bring you down)

You know they talk about you when they tell the lies
So don't be fooled, you better recognize
They're not there for you, they don't care for you
Trust me 'cause I know it's true
You know they smile in your face and make you think they're down
But then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

Get dem haters out your circle (Believe me when I tell you)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (No, no)

See dem try dem best to hurt you, they work you

But then they turn against you when you're not around

I rest my hand across your lips
Feel your breath by my fingertips
No longer can I alay what is right
But this love, it won't give up without a fight

I'd write a note and tear it up
There are no words that could say enough
I know I'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door
But I swear it's gonna hurt me even more

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

Wish I could see the dreams tonight
Wish I could make them turn out right
Tempted to turn back for just one last kiss
But my heart tells me it's better just like this

So this is how the story ends
When love is gone, you can't pretend
No matter who else I give my heart to
There's a part of it that still belongs to you

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

You made me strong when I was weak
Gave my heart a voice to speak
You must've known this day would come
When the lessons are all done
All except for one, no

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

Oh, oh
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye

Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Tellin' you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie

Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There's so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love, but it's really only lustin', yeah

So you see, you and me
We're gettin' close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between "yes" and "no"

'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missin'
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause, baby, kisses don't lie

Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie (Baby, kisses don't lie)
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Tellin' you, it's the truth, don't you ask why (Woah)
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie (Woah)

You whispered in my ear
But are your words sincere?
'Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see, I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life

So you see, you and me
We're gettin' close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between "yes" and "no"

'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missin'
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen (Listen, hey, oh)
And it's tearin' me all up inside (Inside)
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me (Crush me, baby)
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in? (Trust in, hey, yeah)

Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die, we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinking about everything that we've become, and I hate it
I thought we could make it, but I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinking you were out wit' your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I, see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimming, in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playing when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses and my loving
But ain't nobody better than us
Yeah, yeah

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I, see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but you said

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

I guess it’s over indefinitely
But you and I know it’s not that easy to let go
Of everything, that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won’t forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow
Wanna believe you and me, we can figure it out, oh

Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

Gonna make me say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(when we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(when we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride

15 ContributorsThe Last Time LyricsOn the ballad track “The Last Time”, Rihanna is ending her relationship with her boyfriend. He hasn’t done his part in the relationship and she’s reminding him of what he will be missing out on.
Once was a time you and I
Made a promise 'til the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, now this song is through
The things you said, I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you'll know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do, boy
It's sad, but it's true

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (It's the last time)
Or ever will deceive these eyes (Ever will deceive these eyes)
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
No, I'm never gonna hear your lies (Hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear (Make it clear)
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Goodbye
No, baby
Oh, silly me, I believed in your fairytales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife (Oh, baby, yeah)

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (Ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time (It's the last time)
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies (Never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye

Baby, goodbye
'Cause I'm never gonna, never gonna cry no more
Goodbye, goodbye
Oh, ooh, oh-oh-oh

Baby boy, what you done to me?
I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got it bad boy, I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna talk to you and not to mention
Good love that you give to me
I think about it constantly
No, I won't apologize for feeling like I do (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
It's just the simple facts of life
I'm crazy over you

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day, I'm addicted to
What you're giving me
Boy, it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

I understand that you got your crew
But I've got something in mind for you
Make you lose all track of time
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I don't care what anybody got to say
Maybe they never had it quite this way
Let them talk and criticize
They all need to recognize

They might say I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you (I'm a selfish girl)
Every minute of the day, I'm addicted to
What you're giving me

Boy it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
(When it comes to love, I don't share)
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

Boy, you got me trippin'
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy (Crazy)
So amazing (So amazing)
I don't mean to be demanding
But I hope you're understanding
I'm not playing, boy (I'm not playing, boy)
I'm just saying, boy

They might say I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

Every minute of the day (Every day), I'm addicted to
What you're giving me
Boy it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you

Took a chance
Rolled the dice on me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
But when you write a story much too fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
But when it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

Remember when we said our love would last forever?
But then again, how are we to know?
There comes a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned
Oh, ooh-woah

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
But when it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Yeah, yeah

I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart's the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby, can't you see?
It's the way it's gotta be

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
But when it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

Yeah, no, no
Now I know

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It’s the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I’ve gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head, girl
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head, girl
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head, girl

No use, your lips keep moving
But I got a couple of screws loose
Them other boys talkin' about me
They say I'm bad news
And probably best for you to keep this short
It's my time to interrupt
Gonna take a lot to start me up
I don't think you wanna deal right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a gun on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down
You're gonna drown

All over your radio, see me in the stadium
I'll spin your body
Imma run to let these ladies know
Watch your tone around me
Don't push my buttons
You don't really wanna see me get wild
G-G-get wild

I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said

Buckle up, I ride this like a fast car
Suck it up, don't even try to act hard
And you can try to run but you won't get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you
You got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment I met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Gonna take a lot to work me up
I don't think you wanna do it right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a attitude on me
And I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down
Baby might drown

Catch me on your mind baby
Don't waste my time baby
Now watch me wine
You can take that as a sign baby
So left and right with me
Now push my buttons
You see me go wild
Go, go wild

I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

9 ContributorsHaunted Lyrics
Ooh
Ah, ah, ah-ah

Footsteps on the stairs, they aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see

You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave (Oh, no)
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe
(There ain't nothing I could do about it) No, no

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted (Haunted), haunted, ooh
Haunted, haunted, ooh
I don't wanna fight anymore
Someone's walkin' out that door
Haunted, haunted, ooh

But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh

It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
Baby, come here to me
Come into me
It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, it's rainin', rainin'
Come into me
Come into me
It's pourin' rain
Baby, it's pourin' rain
Come here to me
Come into me
It's pourin' rain
Baby, it's pourin' rain
Come here to me
Come into me, into me, into me

8 ContributorsDon’t Even Try Lyrics
Why do you call when I'm not feeling you? (baby)
Why can't you leave? Boy, just walk away
When are you going to understand, oh
What sort of things they be telling you
I've got to stop them from compelling you, boy
They better stop, they're not helping you, oh

Don't even try, 'cause I know
That, you're not the one
Don't waste your time
Goodbye, don't cha cry
The game is done

I'm gonna tell you right here
Let this be the last time
I'm gonna make it so clear
Boy, you must be outcha mind
I'm gonna tell you right here
Let this be the last time
I'm gonna make it so clear
You must be outcha mind

Don't you lie, don't you try
Say goodbye, it just won't work
Your head's in the sky, must be trippin'
Must be high, but there's so much I'm worth
I'm not stupid, I'm not a fool
I know what I'm doing, I went to school
You better listen, do what you're told
My love's more valuable than a pot of gold

I'm gonna tell you right here
Let this be the last time
I'm gonna make it so clear
Boy, you must be outcha mind
I'm gonna tell you right here
Let this be the last time
I'm gonna make it so clear
Must be outcha your mind

The track leaked online in 2009.
You know you thrill me
Seconds of every day
Fly on my body
Feel like I'll levitate
It must be magic
To make them disappear
Erase the past
You made the future clear

I like how you thrill me (Thrill me)
You made me love you (Love you)
You're just like a pill to me
You love to drug me (Drug me)
Calls are lovely (Lovely)
Don't know what you do to me

But I know how much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it, I like it
But I know how much I
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
I like it (Like it), like it (Like it)

You're like the clouds
Breaking before the dawn
Cleared out the path
All I could see was sun
Running through me
Feels like this is destiny (yea)
I'm suffocating
When you too far from me

I like how you thrill me (Thrill me)
You made me love you (Love you)
You're just like a pill to me
You love to drug me (Drug me)
Calls are lovely (Lovely)
Don't know what you do to me

Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
I like it (Like it), like it (Like it)

I don't want to need you
But you please me completely
And I never wanted anything this way
You're just like a love that can't escape
Stare at the lights get lost in time
My reflections in the mirror I don't know (I don't know)
You make me lose on something (Lose composure when you go)
It's your hallucination, makes me wanna go (Makes me wanna go)
Must be your function got me bouncing off the walls (Yeah)
My reflections in the mirror I don't know (Baby, I don't know)
You make me lose on something (Lose composure when you go)
It's your hallucination, makes me wanna go (Baby, you got me)
Must be your function got me bouncing off the walls

But I know how much I
Like it, like it
How much I

[Song 146: Pose In Formation]
3 ContributorsPose In Formation Lyrics
Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess
Paparazzi, catch my fly and my cocky fresh
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces
My Daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bama
I like my Baby's hair with baby hair and afro
I like my negro nose with Jackson 5 nostrils
Earned all this money, But they never take the country out me
I got hot sauce in my bag, Swag

Oh-oh-oh shit
So-oh-oh rich
Eyes low, I'm so loaded
Eyes, pose bitch
Take it off
Wanna see you work like oh my god
And that thang is out I know you know
And you bounce like I know you know
Bitch, I know you know


I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow bone it
I dream big, I work hard, I grind til' I own it
I twirl on them haters, albino alligators
El Camino with the seat low, sipping Cuervo with no chaser
Sometime I go off  (I go Off), I go hard (I go hard)
Get what's mine (take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star)
Cause I slay (slay), I slay (hey), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)
All day (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay)
We gon' slay (slay), gon slay (okay), we slay (okay),I slay (okay)

Okay, okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, 'cause I slay
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, 'cause I slay
Prove to me you got some coordination, 'cause I slay
Slay trick, or you get eliminated

Me, Nicki M, I got too many wins
Pull up with them V twins in my engine
All this ice all around me like a penguin
I ain't talkin' bowlin' but I'm with the kingpin
I pull up with a nigga with a real big dick
That's shit so good, man a bitch came quick
I ain't ever have a beat that a bitch ain't rip
I'm fly every day but a bitch ain't trippin'
You be on that bull, you be on Scott Pippen
I be pimp walkin', I'm limpin'
C's on my bag so they think I'm crippin'
Every nigga in here wanna know what I'm drinkin'
Myx Moscato, niggas
I keep a pillow with me just because I'm tired of niggas
I'm with some flawless girls, they're pretty and they're thick
Bust it open quick, put that pussy on his lips, bitch

My beat low

Yazzzzz bitch
Let me see you get it no no no
Flexin I know that you with it

Y'all make a Texas bama
When he fuck me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster, cause I slay

If he hit it right, I might take him on a flight on my chopper, I slay
Drop him off at the mall, let him buy some J's, let him shop up, 'cause I slay
I might get your song played on the radio station, 'cause I slay

You just might be a black Bill Gates in the making, 'cause I slay

I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow bone it
I dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it
I twirl on them haters, albino alligators
El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser

Bitches is softer than Al Dente,cut from a different kente
Tell em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen, in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas, wheelying them Kawasakis
Shout out, to the Vackee's, Saltfish Ackees
Kisses to my fans, unless I'm feeling, kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland, is on my hand, it's kind of rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj, or Lewinski
Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed

Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, I slay
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation
You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation
Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper

Something 'bout the way that you're working me
Teasing me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you
Gotta have ya for all the things that you do
I, something 'bout this feeling, it's crazy
Amazing that stays with me all night and day
Makes my temperature rise
Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized (Hypnotized)

I'm feeling something that I can't understand

It's your vibe, it's your style, it's the way that you smile
Get a little rush when I hear your name (Hear your name)
It's all magnetic with your hand next to me
Pulling me closer, happens so naturally
We connect, this electrical, this feeling inside
Didn't know that even if I tried

Something 'bout the way that you're working me

Never had a feeling like this before

I just met infatuation
It's something in his smile
Now my obsession can't stand the thoughts of you and I
Something takes over, pulls me up onto my feet
Before I know it, I got you pushing up on me

On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin' it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jerk
I'm making that thang twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doin' what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair, ahh

Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now let's make it a sight to see, baby

On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin' it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jerk
I'm making that thang twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doin' what I do

Got me out here whipping my hair, ahh

We're flashing pictures
Kodak moment memories
Look at the flickers
Sparks on my camera screen
The buried treasure
Come with me and we will find
Create a perfect world, just for you and I

On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me
