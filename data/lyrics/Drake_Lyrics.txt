'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'

And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it

Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearin' less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need, my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Goin' places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Runnin' out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need, my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touchin' road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Baby, I like your style

Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Baby, I like your style

Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time, and that's why

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Fine like a wine, she love me long time
Oh, yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up, and whine it
Back up, back up, and whine it
Girl, just back up, back up, back up, and whine, girl
Oh, yes, steady and fine
Back, up, back up and whine it, mm

Oh, tell me, I need to know
Where do you wanna go?
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control

Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where (Oh, yeah, very long time)
Where, where, where (Back up, back up, and wine am, girl)
Where, where, where, where
'Cause if you're down (Back up, back up, and–)
'Cause if you're down (Back up, back up, and–)
'Cause if you're down (Back up, back up, and–)

I need a one dance (Where, where, where)
Got a Hennessy in my hand (Where, where, where, where)
One more time 'fore I go (Where)
Higher powers taking a hold on me (Where, where, where, where)
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
How do you spell "Hennessy?"
I put two "N"s and two "S"es, is it like that? Hen... Henn... Henn...
It's definitely not showing up
I know "Hennessy" has two "S"es for sure, so I'm gonna take out one of the "N"s

Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes

They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me

Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one

I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back

Maybe in this song, you shouldn't start by saying
Nigga, I said it, I know that you mad
I've emptied the clip over friendlier jabs
You mentioned my seed, now deal with his dad
I gotta go bad, I gotta go bad
Mm, mm, yeah
Drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop a fifty bag for the mob in the spot
Drop a fifty bag, 29 for the thot
Uh, I was really, really tryna keep it PG
I was really, really tryna keep it PG
If you had a set, they'd give your ass a DP
But you civilian gang, in real life, you PC

You know who really bang a set? My nigga YG
You know who really bang a set? My nigga Chuck T
You know who even bang a set out there is CB
And, nigga, Cole losin' sleep on this, it ain't me
You better have some paperwork or that shit fake tea
Can't bе rappin' 'bout no rattin' that we can't read
I mean it's truе a nigga slimed me for my AP
Just like how Metro nigga slimed him for his main squeeze
Out here beggin' for attention, nigga, say please
Always rappin' like you 'bout to get the slaves freed
You just actin' like an activist, it's make-believe
Don't even go back to your hood and plant no money trees
Say you hate the girls I fuck, but what you really mean?
I been with Black and white and everything that's in between
You the Black messiah wifin' up a mixed queen
And hit vanilla cream to help out with your self-esteem
On some Bobby shit, I wanna know what Whitney need
All that puppy love was over in y'all late teens
Why you never hold your son and tell him, "Say cheese"?
We could've left the kids out of this, don't blame me
You a dog and you know it, you just play sweet
Your baby mama captions always screamin', "Save me"
You did her dirty all your life, you tryna make peace
I heard that one of 'em little kids might be Dave Free
Don't make it Dave Free's
'Cause if your GM is your BM secret BD
Then this is all makin' plenty fuckin' sense to me
Ayy, let that shorty breathe
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake, now shake that ass for free
Yeah, yeah
Well, not that kind of free, I'm talkin' 'bout my nigga Dave
Your man a lil' K, we call that shit a mini Drac'
He always said I overlooked him, I was starin' straight
These bars go over Kenny head no matter what I say
I know you like to keep it short, so let me paraphrase
Knew it was smoke when Abel hit us with the serenade
Nigga said, "Uh, uh"
Almost started reachin' for my waist

Drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop a fifty bag for the mob in the spot
Drop a fifty bag, 29 for the thot
Uh, I was really, really tryna keep it—

Yeah
Let me stop playin' around, let me take this shit serious, like
Niggas is a joke, I take it serious, though
Yeah, look

If Drake shooters doing TikToks, nigga
Realest shooter in your gang, that's P's brother, y'all ain't getting shit shot, nigga
Can't listen to the stick talk in falsetto, save it for a hip-hop nigga
You don't even be at home, dog, you a souvenir-out-the-gift-shop nigga
Still mad about that one ho, we ain't even fuck, I just lip-locked with her
I get active when it's war time, I ain't even really let my dick drop, nigga
What the fuck I heard Rick drop, nigga? Talkin' somethin' 'bout a nose job, nigga
Ozempic got a side effect of jealousy and doctor never told y'all niggas
Put a nigga in the bars, let a nigga rot, kind of like your old job, nigga
House sittin' on some land, but it's out where no one even really know y'all niggas
Bitches gotta drive two hours 'fore you pay 'em just to give a blowjob, nigga
Must've snorted up a snowball
'Cause my last record deal was four hundred M's, these days, that's a low ball, nigga
Ayy
Who's next on the list?
Which one of my so-called niggas
Which one of my so-called niggas
Which one of my so-called niggas need a shell from the clip?
Always knew I had to smoke y'all niggas
​good kid, m.A.A.d city van, we'll pop the latch and let the door slide
Tears runnin' down my cheek, laughin' at you pussies dyin', it's a war cry
Weeknd music gettin' played in all the spots where boys got a little more pride
That's why all your friends dippin' to Atlanta, payin' just to find a tour guide
Abel, run your fuckin' bread, need to buy some more chains for some more guys
Let me find another street nigga I can take to the game courtside
Let me get a used Ferrari for a rapper, take the nigga on a horse ride
Anything to take the spotlight off the fact the boss is a drugged-out lil' punk sissy from the Northside
Rakim talkin' shit again
Gassed 'cause you hit my BM first, nigga, do the math, who I was hittin' then?
I ain't even know you rapped still 'cause they only talkin' 'bout your 'fit again
Probably gotta have a kid again 'fore you think of droppin' any shit again
Even when you do drop, they gon' say you should've modeled 'cause it's mid again
Smokin' Fenty 'bout it, should've put you on the first one, tryna get it in
Ask Fring if this a good idea the next time you cuddled in that bed again
She'll even tell you leave the boy alone 'fore you get your head split again
Pluto shit make me sick to my stomach, we ain't never really been through it
Leland Wayne, he a fuckin' lame, so I know he had to be an influence
These niggas had a plan and they finally found a way to rope you into it
Two separate albums dissin', I just did a Kim to it, nigga, skim through it
Me and Savage had the hoes drippin' wet at shows, almost had to swim to it
K-Dot shit is only hittin' hard when Baby Keem put his pen to it
Ross callin' me the white boy and the shit kind of got a ring to it
'Cause all these rappers wavin' white flags while the whole fuckin' club sing to it
Murder scene on your man tonight, then come to the vigil with the candlelight
Body after fuckin' body and you know Rick readin' my Miranda rights
I'm goin' on vacation now, hope next time y'all plan it right
'Cause you gotta pay for sayin' my name, guess now niggas understand the price
Nigga, what? (6ix)


Ayy
Kendrick just opened his mouth, someone go hand him a Grammy right now
Where is your uncle at? 'Cause I wanna talk to the man of the house
West Coast niggas do fades, right? Come get this ass whoopin', I'm handin' 'em out
You wanna take up for Pharrell? Then come get his legacy out of my house
A cease and desist is for hoes, can't listen to lies that come out of your mouth
You called the Tupac estate and begged 'em to sue me and get that shit down
I'm losin' perspective on beef, Boi-1da send beat and I'll kill you for fun
Your daddy got robbed by Top, you Stunna and Wayne, like father, like son
Anthony set up the plays, Kojo be chargin' you double for nothin'
They shook about what I'ma say, but textin' your phone like, "We already won"
You tell me what I shouldn't say, but fuck it, my nigga, it's already done
We already know it's a twenty-v-one, we already know why you went number one
It's clearly because of The Boy, the honorable thing is to give me the loot
You right about "Fuck the big three," it's only Big D, and there's video proof
Our sons should go play at the park, two lightskin kids, that shit would be cute
Unless you don't want to be seen with anyone that isn't Blacker than you
We get it, we got it
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
We get that you like to put gin in your juice
We get that you think that you Bishop in Juice
When you put your hands on your girl, is it self-defense 'cause she bigger than you?
Your back is up against the curb, you diggin' for dirt, should be diggin' for proof
Why did you move to New York? Is it 'cause you livin' that bachelor life?
Proposed in 2015, but don't wanna make her your actual wife
I'm guessin' this wedding ain't happenin', right?
'Cause we know the girls that you actually like
Your darkest secrets are comin' to light
It's all on your face like what happened to Mike
Oh shit, it's all makin' sense, maybe I'm Prince and you actually Mike
Michael was prayin' his features would change so people believe that he's actually white
Top would make you do features for change, get on pop records and rap for the whites
And wait, you say your brother Jermaine, but you wanted him to stay out of the light
Oh shit, just follow me, right? 'Cause nothin' you sayin' could bother me, right?
I get off the plane and nothing has changed, I head to Delilah with all of my ice
Head to Delilah with all of my ice, head to Delilah with all of my ice
This shit gotta be over by now for anyone out here that's calling it, right?
You're dead
You're dead, you're dead
There's nowhere to hide, there's nowhere to hide, you know what I mean
They hired a crisis management team to clean up the fact that you beat on your queen
The picture you painted ain't what it seem, you're dead

I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got

In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Oh) She want all the fame (Want all the fame)
I hear that shit all the time (All the time)
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork
Watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert
Ill nigga alert" (Damn)
You need that work? I got that work, got bitches in my condo ('Do)
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note (Tell 'em)
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard, it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (True, be arrested)

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga, don't watch that 'cause I—

Touched down in '86
Knew I was the man by the age of six
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard cha new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie, don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, chu get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits, goddamn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all-on't fuck with us, then we-on't fuck wit' ch'all
It's no different over on this side, goddamn
Should I listen a everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you-on't need no help"
Cashing checks, and I'm bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next, but I'm about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I'm the light-skinned Keith Sweat
I'ma make it last forever
It's not cho' turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I'm on the road, box office sales
I'm getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you da please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, goddamn

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot

Hoe, shut the fuck up
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due (God)
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full (Skrrt)
And, to them hoes, I'm e'rything
E'rything but gentle
But I still take my time (Time)
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need a hit
Keep a broad on the flo' year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the .9
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Prolly making mo' money than me and shit
I swear da God I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one (No)
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one (No)
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint, but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating, but it ain't working (Ain't working)
Lil' bitch (Bitch)

Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I'm blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to you
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do

What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause...

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
"Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?"
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here, eh?
Y'all need to know yourself

[Song 11: The Motto]
262 ContributorsThe Motto LyricsOn this bonus track from Take Care, Drake enlists his Young Money mentor Lil Wayne for an ode to his motto in life: YOLO.
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin' paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't, then again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

One time, fuck one time
I'm callin' niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy, so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall, put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted, doorknob
Talk stupid, off with your head
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer Bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet, niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue-kiss her other tongue
Skeet, skeet, skeet, water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt, Tunechi

Now she want a photo, you already know, though (Yeah)
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it; if I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up (Lay up)
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits, I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy (Ha-ha)
Fuck all that "Drake, you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker, that's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we could really get it, we could go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it (Arf!)
I run this shit, they like, "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't made me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

The other night Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough, I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)

Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)

Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik

Get the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)

Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach, but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said, "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em, "Less is more, nigga, it's plenty of us"

Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik

Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
Five hundred million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uh
I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah, we got it, bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot, but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's, tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil—Jesus, grab the wheel


Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg

Since, things never been the same

That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say (I don't trust a word)
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
(That's just what I heard)
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

Skrrt
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

Hello?
Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good, you still working?
Tonight, right now?
Did I go out? Yeah, I went out, I went
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit
Wine or water?
Did you say something about a cold drink? I don't know
I'm delirious

Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you pick up, I know he's not around, oh, oh

Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flight's in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you pick up, I know he's not around
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just callin' 'cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in there mixed up
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
Fuck, I'm sorry
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

You not gon' come?
I guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, "You niggas crazy," I hope no one heard that
Yeah, I hope no one heard that
'Cause if they did, we gon' be in some trouble, yeah
If they did, we gon' be in some trouble, trouble, oh

Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, "Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—

Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
'Cause we—

Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that

Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?

I could never be nobody number-one fan
Your first number one, I had to put it in your hand
You pussies can't get booked outside America for nan'
I'm out in Tokyo because I'm big in Japan
I'm the hitmaker y'all depend on
Backstage in my city, it was friendzone
You won't ever take no chain off of us
How the fuck you big steppin' with a size-seven men's on?
This the bark with the bite, nigga, what's up?
I know my picture on the wall when y'all cook up
Extortion baby, whole career, you been shook up
'Cause Top told you, "Drop and give me fifty," like some push-ups, huh
Your last one bricked, you really not on shit
They make excuses for you 'cause they hate to see me lit
Pull your contract 'cause we gotta see the split
The way you doin' splits, bitch, your pants might rip
You better do that motherfuckin' show inside the bity
Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty
Then we need a verse for the Swifties
Top say drop, you better drop and give 'em fifty
Pipsqueak, pipe down
You ain't in no big three, SZA got you wiped down
Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down
Like your label, boy, you in a scope right now
And you gon' feel the aftermath of what I write down
I'm at the top of the mountain, so you tight now
Just to have this talk with your ass, I had to hike down
Big difference 'tween Mike then and Mike now
What the fuck is this, a twenty-v-one, nigga?
What's a prince to a king? He a son, nigga
Get more love in the city that you from, nigga
Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, nigga
Yeah, I'm the 6ix God, I'm the frontrunner
Y'all nigga manager was Chubbs lil' blunt runner
Claim the 6ix and you boys ain't even come from it
And when you boys got rich, you had to run from it
Cash blowin' Abel bread, out here trickin' (Out here trickin')
Shit we do for bitches, he doin' for niggas (What the fuck?)
Jets, whips, chains, wicked, wicked, wicked (Wicked, wicked)
Spend it like you tryna fuck, boy, you trippin', boy, you trippin'
Drizzy Chip 'n Dale, probably got your bitch Chanel
I just got 'em done, boy, don't make me have to chip a nail
Rolling Loud stage, y'all were turnt, that was slick as hell
Shit'll probably change if your BM start to kiss and tell
Hugs and kisses, man, don't tell me 'bout no switches
I'll be rockin' every fuckin' chain I own next visit, ayy
I be with some bodyguards like Whitney
Top say drop, your little midget ass better fuckin'

Ayy, better drop and give me fifty, ayy
Drop and give me fifty, drop and give me fifty, ayy
Niggas really got me out here talkin' like I'm 50, ayy
Niggas really got me out here rappin' what I'm livin'
I might take your latest girl and cuff her like I'm Ricky
Can't believe he jumpin' in, this nigga turnin' fifty
Every song that made it on the chart, he got from Drizzy
Spend that lil' check you got and stay up out my business
Nigga, shout out to the hooper that be bustin' out the griddy
We know why you mad, nigga, I ain't even trippin'
All that lil' heartbroken Twitter shit for bitches
This for all the top dogs, drop and give me fifty, drop, drop
And that fuckin' song y'all got did not start the beef with us
This shit been brewin' in a pot, now I'm heatin' up
I don't care what Cole think, that Dot shit was weak as fuck
Champagne trippin', he is not fuckin' easin' up
Nigga callin' Top to see if Top wanna peace it up
"Top, wanna peace it up? Top, wanna peace it up?"
Nah, pussy, now you on your own when you speakin' up
You done rolled deep to this, it's not fuckin' deep enough

Numbers-wise, I'm out of here, you not fuckin' creepin' up
Money-wise, I'm out of here, you not fuckin' sneakin' up
Cornball, your show money merch-money fee to us
I'ma let you niggas work it out because I seen enough
This ain't even everything I know, don't wake the demon up
This ain't even everything I know, don't wake the demon up

Drop a fifty bag, twenty-nine for the thot

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

Ayy, ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, "What?" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out and, goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, huh

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, woah
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouths with a bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so, Drake

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Mama is a saint, yes, she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you back

How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at?

Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah
These days, I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah

And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you

Lately, you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it

Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix (Six)
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I

I'm too good to you

You take my love for granted

No, I'm too good to you

The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same
Our relationship changed that, or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline

This a "forever" thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a "whatever" thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle
She from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me
This shit is everything
Don't know where we stand
I used to hit you 'bout everything, oh
Are we still good? Are we still good?

If I need to talk, are you around?
Are you down for the cause?

Yeah, these days, these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl, I always stay down
Get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin', girl, and you might feel like nothin' was the same

I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know


Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to

How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

I think I killed everybody in the game last year
Man, fuck it, I was on, though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong, though
Shout out to all my niggas livin' tax-free
Nowadays, it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga, yeah
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I'm just playin' the field, nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussin' my career again?
Askin' if I'll be goin' platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man, all of your flows bore me, paint dryin'
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearin' the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yeah
It's been that way from the beginnin'
I just been playin', I ain't even notice I was winnin'
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
You say I'm old news, well, who the new star?
'Cause if I'm goin' anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over fed time
But shout out to the niggas that's doin' dead time
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start, boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfuckin' funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feelin' good, livin' better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back pavin' the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinkin' at the Palms last night
And ended up losin' everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
Three in the morning, still going down

Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'—nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause, man, it's a mission
Tryna fight to the finish just to see, am I finished?

On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker

I'm on my worst behavior
Don't you ever get it fucked up

So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done growed up

I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me

Mothafuckers never loved us

Worst behavior

Who's hot, who not?
Tell me, who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you, bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

Remember?
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it (Ayy)

Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, "They miss the old Drake," girl, don't tempt me
"If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do"
I'm like, "Why I gotta be all that?"
But still, I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap-opera rappers, all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'?
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

They know, they know, they know

They know, they know, they know

That the real is on the rise

Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking
Looking
Looking

Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me, nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder, nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon’ really feel it now
I’m out here…

Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here?
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six, soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…

Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for...

They don’t want us to have a bigger pool than Kanye

[Song 32: The Language]
162 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisThe Language Lyrics“The Language” is a simple, braggadocious track. Drake asserts his position as rap’s elite, fending off newcomers, and solidifying that he can, and will, stunt because he has ties to the #1 Stunna.
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Look, look

I don't know why they been lyin', but your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but, oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, "Girl, that's all that we do"

I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And, fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny
You don't even know 'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl
She been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami to heat up the city
And that's word to Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but, oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, "Girl, that's all that we do"

Famous and dangerous
You understand me?
Showtime, headlines, Big Tyme
"Sunshine", tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet, nigga – stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami to heat up the city
And that's word to Stunna, you know it

Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

Yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

Servin' up a pack (Servin' up a pack)

Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I’m a hard hitta
Yeah, I’m light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure

I get 2 million a pop and that’s standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me

Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went

You don’t wanna play with him (Nah, nah, nah)
They’ll be mournin' you like 8 a.m. (R.I.P.)
Pinky ring 'til I get a wedding ring (Woah, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (Big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy, damn (Woo, yeah)
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit)
Either hand is the upper hand (Oh, yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (Woah, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (Nah, nah, nah, nah)

Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can't go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents
Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy)

Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you

Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah

But how 'bout now? (Now)

And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

My heart belongs to you...

Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost
(Yeah)

It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
To save you, instead, they say

Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true
Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

Let’s try one more time
Cool

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oh, don't think about—)

Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outgo
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls
And they end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a pot luck, you need to come with it, don't run from it
Like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it one-hunnid
Met a lot of girls in my times there
Word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year
Man, I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like, "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin'
'Fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it
For like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath
You're too worried about being the best out"

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oh, don't think about—)

Uh, someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess"
Nah, fuck that shit
Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do
You gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign
That's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment
Telling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit
Like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together
We just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down
Pick the pen up or put the pen down?
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen-pal
But we've been down

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Oh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, oh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, oh, oh
(Don't do that—)

Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
'Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well, if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'

Okay, look, I'm honest, girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says, "I know you changed
I never see you 'cause you're always busy doin' things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewin' things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends tellin' you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your Mr. Perfect
I could tell that you been cryin' all night, drinkin' all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
A shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you

Alright

The Pulitzer Prize winner is definitely spiralin'
I got your fucking lines tapped, I swear that I'm dialed in
First, I was a rat, so where's the proof of the trial then?
Where's the paperwork or the cabinet it's filed in?
1090 Jake woulda took all the walls down
The streets woulda had me hidin' out in a small town
My Montreal connects stand up, not fall down
The ones that you're getting your stories from, they all clowns
I am a war general sеasoned in preparation
My jacket is covеred in medals, honor and decoration
You waited for this moment, overcome with the desperation
We plotted for a week, and then we fed you the information
A daughter that's eleven years old, I bet he takes it
We thought about givin' a fake name or a destination
But you so thirsty, you not concerned with investigation
Instead you in that Venice studio, it's a celebration
You gotta learn to fact-check things and be less impatient
Your fans are rejoicin' thinkin' this is my expiration
Even the picture you used, the jokes and the medication
The Maybach glove and the drug he uses for less inflation
Master manipulator, you bit on the speculation
You dumb and reactive, nigga, I'm petty with dedication
What about the bones we dug up in that excavation?
And why isn't Whitney denyin' all of the allegations?
Why is she followin' Dave Free and not Mr. Morale?
You haven't seen the kids in six months, the distance is wild
Dave leavin' heart emojis underneath pics of the child
Speakin' of anything with a child, let's get to that now
This Epstein angle was the shit I expected
TikTok videos you collected and dissected
Instead of bein' on some diss-direct shit
You rather fucking grab your pen and misdirect shit
My mom came over today, and I was like, "Mother, I—
Mother, I—, mother—," ah, wait a second
That's that one record where you say you got molested
Aw, fuck me, I just made the whole connection
This about to get so depressin'
This is trauma from your own confessions
This when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected
That's why these pedophile raps and shit you so obsessed with, it's so excessive
They actin' like it's so aggressive, but you just never known affection
I don't wanna diss you anymore, this really got me second-guessin'
"Touch My Body" by Mariah Carey play, you probably start reflectin'
I never been with no one underage, but now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with
Just for clarity, I feel disgusted, I'm too respected
If I was fucking young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested
I'm way too famous for this shit you just suggested
But that's not the lesson, clearly, there's a deeper message
Deep cuts that never healed, and now they got infected
Like if Dave really fucked your girl and got her pregnant, talk about breedin' resentment
I'm not sure how to ease the sentiment, this shit's too intimate
I'm praying you recover from both incidents
But you a piece of shit, so this shit really no coincidence
Drake is not a name that you gon' see on no sex offender list, Eazy-Duz-It
You mentionin' A minor, but niggas gotta B sharp and tell the fans, "Who was it?"
You thought you left D flat, D major
I'll slit your throat with the razor
And do Rick Ross Air like that one flight from Malaysia
I'm your baby mama's screen saver
Only fuckin' with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I'd never look twice at no teenager
I'm a fucking hitmaker, dog, not a peacemaker
Yeah, bullets that I'm stuffin' in each chamber, your ass in extreme danger
Stop buyin' views and bot comments, you may as well keep the paper
Shit you 'bout to need for later
I give a fuck about your streamin' data
You could drop a hundred more records, I'll see you later
Yeah, maybe when you meet your maker
I don't wanna fight with a woman beater, it feeds your nature
If you still bumpin' R. Kelly, you could thank the Savior
Said if they deleted his music, then your music is goin' too, a hypocrite
I don't understand why these people praise ya
Soundin' like you send him commissary when he need some paper
Album droppin' soon, no wonder you turn to a clout chaser 'stead of doin' hard labor
Nigga, I'll see you when I see you like Fantasia
And Whitney, you can hit me if you need a favor
And when I say I hit ya back, it's a lot safer
Huh, I promise

Yeah
I'm not gonna lie, this shit was some, some good exercise, like
It's good to get out, get the pen workin'
You would be a worthy competitor if I was really a predator
And you weren't fuckin' lying to every blogger and editor, but
It is what it is
You definitely got this shit burnt the fuck out though, like
You got ten more records to drop
The one before the last one, we finessed you into tellin' a story that doesn't even exist
And then, you go and drop the West Coast one to try and cover that up
I would like that one, that w—, that-that would be some shit I could dance to if you wasn't
Triplin' down on some whole other bullshit, but
You know, at least your fans are gettin' some raps out of you
I'm happy I could motivate you
Bring you back to the game, like
You know, but
Just let me know when we're gettin' to the facts
Everything in my shit is facts (Prove it)
I'm waitin' on you to return the favor, like

Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

153 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolLegend Lyrics“Legend” is the hard-hitting opener to Drake’s surprise mixtape If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late.
On the track, Drake’s braggadocio goes 0 to 100, real quick as he flaunts his success.

Yeah

When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend

I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish, make it ándale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They don't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die, I'm a mothafuckin' legend

Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend

I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeah, you know wassup, yeah
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die, I'm a mothafuckin' legend

My old flex is my new flex now and we're workin' on it, yeah
And that's why I need
All the energy that you bring to me
My last girl would tear me apart
But she'd never wanna split a ting with me
But when it comes to you, you

Yeah
I'm working on dying

I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check

You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (Ayy, ayy)
Every month
She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know (That I know)
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho

Yeah
Yeah
Man

It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her, but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt and you smokin' heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it, and we argue about spendin' money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
And you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep, but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad, uh
Maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbin' a bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh, it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinkin' of signin' me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
And get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we should've known
'Cause you deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've
It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn
Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid, but it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fightin' going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
Now I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, then you got to me
Then you'd toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah
Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life so worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything
You said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced, but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've
Hi Aubrey
I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this
In this comfortable place
All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feeling about that
So God bless you

Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered (Yeah)
Stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need forty-thousand people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute while I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud, but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up, we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7 a.m. in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song, it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshiping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary

You're to blame for what we could have been 'cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, so
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew

Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it

I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed

Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
Yeah, slightly, huh, took a left turn there
But very much 6 a.m.​
Slightly been awake for twenty-four hours
So please forgive me

Yeah, yeah, fam, I'm wafflin'

What these bitches want from a nigga?

On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you get at me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a "Are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit

So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
Twenty, keep the bar rollin'
Fake IDs in the trash, we goin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash comin' straight from Poland

Why? 'Cause they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew

They loving the crew, woah

Yeah
Smokin' weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know where Harvard gets us
But seein' my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times where I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers, just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, "Your lyrics do shit for me"
I told my story and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for twenty
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin'
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew

Woah

[Song 51: Doing It Wrong]
128 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolDoing It Wrong Lyrics“Doing It Wrong” is soft, low-tempo, break-up ballad with a harmonica solo from the legendary Stevie Wonder.
The song interpolates Don McLean’s 1977 song “The Wrong Thing To Do.”
When a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, "I love you too"

But I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh, she knows it
Oh, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
Oh, oh

We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, "I love you too"

But I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh, she knows it
Oh, I know it, we all know it

A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend, I want it all to be for you, oh
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh

Just let that shit sink in, ha
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days?
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
'Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days (Trippin')
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry" (How you do?)
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga, it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
'Cause you got the Batphone and my work line
You should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days, but oh (Yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's
It's always gonna be yours

Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it

Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that

They say it's yours, nobody else's

How you feel about
Comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights
I know we only fuckin' out of spite 'cause your man don't
Do you right, do you right
I could fuck you so good, then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas
Who you like, baby, who you like?

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there 'cause niggas that I know there
Don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried 'cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life, and this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

I, I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me, baby
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing

Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?

Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife

But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunnin' for the title
Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, "Babe, I think there was a typo"
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'

But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official

Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on

I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay

So if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat
Now you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eat
Keep gettin' temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time
Y'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin' me hits
But then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
My spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin' with my name
And I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby, "I'ma done him for you"
Tell 'Ye we got a invoice comin' to you
Considerin' that we just sold another 20 for you

To be honest
Duppy

Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up? (Yeah)
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you, yeah

And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name (Ah), on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous

Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way

Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you, yeah

And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name (Ah), on purpose, yeah

It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said "no strings attached" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain?
You'll see new heights you’ll be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

Dom Rosé toast
Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, "Poor me"
Where you at? I never see you

Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It’s bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me, "Pay it no mind"
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die

Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

Hidden Hills where I post, yeah
'Ye already know, yeah
I'm the troublemaker in the neighborhood
Far as troublemakin' goes, yeah
House party up the road, yeah
I'm not Kid 'n Play
This kid doesn't play about the flow, yeah
Y'all keep playin' with your nose, yeah
You get high and do the most, yeah
How you let the kid fightin'
Ghost-writin' rumors turn you to a ghost?
Oh, you niggas got jokes
Free smoke, free smoke

You've got me feeling emotions
Ayy, higher
Ah
You've got me fe–
You, oh

Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

You've got me fe–
You, oh
You've got me fe–
You, oh, ayy

Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is "Leave me alone"
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, "Why let the story run if it's false?"
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher

This is all God's doin', man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm Satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinkin' like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only twenty-nine, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga (Yeah)

Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh

Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position (Yah)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (21)
Make me call my bro (21, uh)

Baby, I'm a savage, I ain't romantic
When I come around, these rapper niggas start to panic
And they pockets goin' under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstandin'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now (Hatin' now)
She was playin' with me then but she waitin' now (21, 21)
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now (Mansion)
I was fightin' niggas then but I'm sprayin' now (Blastin')
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss (Nope)
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch (Broke)
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit (21)
They the type to stand in line for some free shit (Broke bitch)
Baby girl gon' suck it till her jaws locked (Suck it up)
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block (Fuckin' up)
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin' (21)
We the one droppin' niggas, we the ones (We the ones)
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come (21, 21)
You that nigga snitchin' on your people, huh? (Shh)
21 Savage a.k.a. The Reaper, huh (21)
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin', huh (Ya dig?)

Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (Shut the fuck up)
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end (Count the fuck up)
Make me call my bros for assistance (21)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (Bros)
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (Hol' up)
Put me in a fucked-up position (21)
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, dawg

I don't need love, I'm the GOAT, I just hit the beat and float
And I'm sellin' out arenas but you puttin' on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
'Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow?
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need
Chain smokin' in the house, it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my Ts with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the TL, now I'm cheese
I'ma turn this TSX into a Benz soon
I'ma see a lot of blessin's for my friends soon
Hunnid-fifty-inch screen in my bedroom
6'1", man, a nigga need some leg room

Shit ain't been the same like before
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh

Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance

Yeah
Alright, yeah

Comin' off the last record
I'm gettin' twenty million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga, that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
'Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga
Rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
Yeah, I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
'Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self-explanatory, you just here to spread the story
Wassup?

Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money, nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission, tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B, I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote, we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these nineties fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like "Fuck it", like "YOLO"
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me
Now real nigga, wassup?
Ayy, yeah, ayy
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

If there's hell below, I'll see you when you get there
Are you enjoyin' yourselves?
If we may, we would just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years
It don't mean that we can't have a good life
So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us

How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with, "This time will be different"
Oh, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends, if you're looking

Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', babe

Ayy
She just wanna run around the city
And make memories that she can barely remember
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power (Yeah)
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in a eighteen-wheeler
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She used to say, "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was
And never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here, just swanging (Ayy)
Don't talk to me like I'm famous (Ayy)
And don't assume 'cause I don't respect assumptions, bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby
I'll be here, just swanging (Ayy, ayy)

I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 East
And exit at Markham Road in the East End
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired, I renew it after the weekend
Fuck, I know I said that shit the last seven weekends
Girl, I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
'Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin', know you could feel it
Twenty on pump, whatever, I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there, just swangin'
I'll be there, just swangin'
I treat you good, girl, like you're famous
I know I'm late, it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now, swangin, girl

Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'

Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)

Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?

And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'

Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like

Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through

Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been? You deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight

I put it on e'rything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things

Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this, I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now

Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though

Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?

Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us

Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter (Skrrt)
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out "YOLO," yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of

Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind

Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up

Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star-struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no, we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggin'
Trust me, this information is vital
I’m tryin' to take the high road, I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin' live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin' people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!

(Stop, stop, stop, stop…)
Have you seen me? I’m doing so good
Every time we meet: "Oh, I’m so sorry"
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)
"You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long
Industry people… regular people…
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak."

Which utensil to use for which food, like
I got a schedule to attend to, though
I can't really...
(6ix)

You bitches really get carried away
Makin' mistakes, then you beg me to stay
Got me wiggin' on you like I'm Arrogant Tae
You got my mind in a terrible place
Whipped and chained you like American slaves
Act like you not used to Sheraton stays
I met the nigga you thought could replace
How were there even comparisons made?
Bitch, next time, I swear on my grandmother grave
I'm slimin' you for them kid choices you made

Slimin' you out, slimin' you out, slimin' you out

Ayy, this ain't the littest I could get on you bitches
Send wires on wires on wires like Idris
You lucky that I don't take back what was given
I could have you on payment plan 'til you're hundred and fifty
And my slime right here, she got some bars for y'all niggas
So I'ma fall back and let SZA talk her shit for a minute

Slimin' you out, slimin' you out, slime

Damn, these niggas got me so twisted
How the fuck you so real, but play bitch on my line?
I can feel what you're spinnin'
Got too much pride to let no burnt nigga slime me out
Pull up, go write about
My night, got time, let's discuss all those lies about
Frontin' out here like you diggin' me out
And I ain't even cummin', I'm in and out
And you ain't 'bout the shit you rappin' about
And I can spin a ho, I'm airin' it out
I'm goin' off like a sawed-off
You tell these hoes you ain't cuddlin'
But with me, you know you doin' all that shit
You tellin' these hoes you ain't trickin' off
But with me, you know I'm gon' get it all
How you niggas get so carried away?
Trippin' when that dick is barely third place
Fucked out of pity, it's cute that you lame
Dip 'cause it's mid, I can't fake like it's hangin'

Slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out
Oh-woah, woah

Yeah
January, you pretend to see life clearly, yearly
February is the time that you put the evil eye and the pride aside
For the fantasy of gettin' married, very scary
March got you already second guessin' titles
April, spring is here and just like a spring, you start to spiral
May brings some warmer days, poolside, gettin' very tan
June have you movin' ice cold, goin' back and forth with a married man
July, that's when I found out you lied
August, it was "baby" this, "baby" that like you had your tubes tied
September, we fallin' off, but I'm still the man you tryna win over
October is all about me 'cause your turn should've been over
November got you moodboardin' for next year and you're single
December the gift-givin' month and now you wanna rekindle our year
Tryna build trust, showin' me your DMs, how they tryna bag you
Ironic how the news I got about you ended up bein' bad news
Get a nigga hit for fifty racks, girl, the beef cost like it's wagyu
Get a nigga hit, I'll make his ass see the light like a half-moon
Shout to QC, pretty sure I made Pee M's like it's past noon
All I really know is W's and M's, life lookin' like a bathroom
All I really know is M bags like I drove through and ordered fast food
Sayin' that I'm too guarded with my feelings, who the fuck even asked you?
Seven bodyguards just in case somebody really wanna try and crash through
Don't know why I listen to you when I hear you talkin' to me, it's some half-truths
If I don't pay your rent, it end up like an old hairstyle, girl, it's past due
If I don't—

Ah-ah-ah, that's as far as I got

Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name

You wanna grip a Benz wheel

You dream big and sleep late

Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone 'til November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh

Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too
We're perfect for each other

Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)

'Cause to her, I'm just a rapper and soon, she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow, we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wan' be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her
And she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
See, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi

You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)

Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in a Boise state
Can't see a play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, "That ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you, baby
"Someone Like You," more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the rabies

Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that muh'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though

I told y'all muh'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys-forever, hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a walkie-talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch, check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it

I told y'all muh'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge" song
"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was" song

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'

I'm outside, 29, G5, Seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, Frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace

Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party, uh
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started

I can never love her, she a busybody
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin' me, I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I said see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep it on us anymore, it's with security

I'm outside (Yeah), 29 (Yeah), G5, Seaside

Rollin' 84s, it ain't no safety
Ridin' rich and wavy
Gotta roll over to you, gotta get my release
Spread your legs downtown as I'm goin' out to eat
Even hear the raw sounds when that raw got me in sleep (Oh, oh)
I'ma roll on 'em 'fore I ever let 'em roll on me
Split this one down the middle, wake up in the harmony (Sick)
Worried sick, I'm sick of worryin' (Sick, sick)

I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons (Yeah)
Early-mornin' shoulder rubs, the lawyer sounding celebrant (It's lit)

At the crib all by myself, this shit been cavin' in
Scrollin' through my call log, by emojis, how I'm savin' 'em
Them heart eyes, that peach one, my old ones, but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies them (Yeah)
Purple demon face one push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (Break it)
And saved a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town
Know their position, you know ass up with the face down (Let's go)
I'm never content, two mil' a event, I get it frequent
I'm make an expense, to me, it's just cents

I'm droppin' the top 'cause bro tryna spin
She droppin' her top, she back again
Publicly she at the crib again, company (Yeah, yeah)
I let it slide when I really shoulda slid (Ooh, ooh)
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repayin' me back (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Now follow my rift
Tell me what type of payment is that? (Oh, oh-oh) I put that on my kid

Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

Look, mama hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now

I made a decision last night that I would die for it

If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it, yeah
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now

And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass

Still on top like I'm scared of the drop

Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist

Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me

It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (Yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on (Yeah)
I don't know what's going on

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (Yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

Any time people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it

I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (Think about me)
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Cliqued up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Yeah
I know

Can you talk to the opps' necks for me? (Okay)
21, do your thing 21, do your thing (21)
Do your thing, 21, do your thing

Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period, baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic (21, 21)
I'll slap a pussy nigga with a ratchet (Pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get the addy (Pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my ear, your ho a flea (Fuck)
Why my opps be posting guns and only use they feet? (21)

All you hoes, all of you hoes need to remember who y'all talkin' to
It's a Slaughter Gang CEO
I got dick for you if I'm not workin', girl
If I'm busy then fuck no

When your bank account get low, you need to find you someone—


Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit, ayy

Pussies cliquin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Nan' nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing B&E
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then it's BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin' every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P. to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late
21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate
All the dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie-ass mistake, ayy

Ah, what? What?
Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
On God
Boy, look, you the motherfuckin' man, boy, you, ooh

Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me

Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over

You can be the one to take control, call me over

We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, "When that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' 'bout, "You gotta leave already?"
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said "You're mine" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley four-door already
Even as a boy, I was the boy already
So you know that that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for Third Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime say you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy
You would prolly kill another man for the boy
You would prolly...
You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy

You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy, yeah

I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry

Uh, she's losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now, oh

I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down

You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months

Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You say that you're over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes, don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with your shit, I put you back in your place
She tells me, "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make, I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now, oh

I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time, we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone

Just know if I diss you, I'd make sure you know that I hit you like I'm on your caller ID
I'm namin' the album The Fall Off, it's pretty ironic 'cause it ain't no fall off for me
Still in this bitch gettin' bigger, they waitin' on the kid to come drop like a father to be
Love when they argue the hardest MC
Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?
We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali
Huh, yeah, yeah, huh-huh, yeah, Muhammad Ali
The one that they call when they shit ain't connectin' no more, feel like I got a job in IT
Rhymin' with me is the biggest mistake
The Spider-Man meme is me lookin' at Drake
It's like we recruited your homies to be demon deacons, we got 'em attending your wake
Hate how the game got away from the bars, man, this shit like a prison escape
Everybody steppers, well, fuck it, then everybody breakfast and I'm 'bout to clear up my plate (Huh, huh, huh)
When I show up, it's motion picture blockbuster
The GOAT with the golden pen, the top toucher
The spot rusher, sprayed his whole shit up, the crop duster
Not Russia, but apply pressure
To your cranium, Cole's automatic when aimin' 'em
With The Boy in the status, a stadium
Nigga


Ayy, I'm 'bout to, I'm 'bout to
I'm 'bout to, yeah
Yeah

I'm 'bout to click out on this shit
I'm 'bout to click, woah
I'm 'bout to click out on this shit
I'm 'bout to click, woah
I'm down to click out on you hoes and make a crime scene
I click the trigger on the stick like a high beam
Man, I was Bentley wheel whippin' when I was nineteen
She call my number, leave her hangin', she got dry-cleaned
She got a Android, her messages is lime green
I search one name, and end up seein' twenty tings
Nadine, Christine, Justine, Kathleen, Charlene, Pauline, Claudine
Man, I pack 'em in this phone like some sardines
And they send me naked pictures, it's the small things
You niggas still takin' pictures on a Gulfstream
My youngins richer than you rappers and they all stream
I really hate that you been sellin' them some false dreams
Man, if your pub was up for sale, I buy the whole thing
Will they ever give me flowers? Well, of course not
They don't wanna have that talk, 'cause it's a sore spot
They know The Boy, the one they gotta boycott
I told Jimmy Jam I use a Grammy as a door stop
Girl gave me some head because I need it
And if I fuck with you, then after, I might eat it, what?
Niggas talkin' 'bout when this gon' be repeated
What the fuck, bro? I'm one away from Michael
Nigga, beat it, nigga, beat it, what?

Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what?
Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what?
Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, ayy, beat it, what?
Don't even pay me back on none them favors, I don't need it

Studio right in my yaad
I'm doin' ten in a week
How long I been on this streak?
Dream about work in my sleep (Oof)
Okay, I got a lock on the streets
Shoutout to T, he did three
And he brought it in 'cause of me
You don't know nothin' 'bout me
Life for my bruddas is deep
Long as they all on they feet
Long as they pockets is greaze (Greaze!)
I'm in the penthouse but still, nothin' is sweet (Yeah)
Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep (Mmm!)
Taller in person, you'll see when we meet
I heard your new shit and I'm kissin' my teeth
Jheeze!

You know dem ones? Hahaha
Yeah, ahh!

Bringin' that dirty-dirty, bringin' that certy (Certy)
Mizzy with the quick extension, ringin' off thirty (Rah!)
I've got bitches in the merky, swervin', lookin' all curvy
And you already know I love them breasts, lookin' all perky
Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spen jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy (Oof!)
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky (Jerky)
Whippin' that white girl (Yeah?), cookin' that Cersei (Dah!)
I was pushin' that dark shit, pushin' that charcoal (Yeah)
Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo (Mmm!)
Look at them jokers, look at that arsehole (That arsehole)
Man are gettin' bread now, and this is that hard dough (Yeah)

Batman, da-na-na-da-na

Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
Yeah

Baby, she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know, I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires

Wrote this shit, January '21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city, wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person, first thing they say is, "I know you need a break"
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose, I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah

And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

2 Chainz, I'm a real one
Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, "Thanks for givin' to me," like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers
That's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like “tha Carter”
Mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin'
Fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans, but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God
Point guard and the two guard
"Pretty Girls Like Trap Music", so I woke up with my wood hard

And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense

Yeah
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to "R.I.P." about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it

Yeah, gotta love it
*Laughs*
Yeah

Switchin' up the angles

Change for the better, hit it, then dead her

After helpin' Mama out, the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own

And now we blowin' up
Blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, yeah
My niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Aw yeah, aw yeah
You know what I'm
Oh yes, oh yeah

Yeah, uh

You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfuckin' North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh

That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, woah, woah, woah

Let the chopper bang on you like a Blood or a Cripper (Gang)
Flipper, so much bread, I'm a gymnast
Made so much money off of dummies, off of dummies (Yeah, gang)

I'm mister body catcher (Gang), Slaughter Gang soul snatcher

Type of nigga that can't look me in the eyes

When I see you, better put that fuckin' pride to the side
Many times, plenty times, I survived
Beef is live, spoiler alert, this nigga dies

Keep blickies, and you know the weed sticky
My finger itchy, the Glock like to leave hickeys
Your shooters iffy, a street punk could never diss me
I come straight up out the 6, and we don't spare sissies

I fuck with her, and fuck with her, and her
I hit up err, tell him do the err, for sure
Voodoo curse, it got him while I flew to Turks
Know the dogs had to hit them where we knew it hurts

Tell the coach don't take me out, I like to finish games
And my pen insane, am I menacin'?
There's like eighty of us now, that's the scary thing

Yeah

Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight, ah
Fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot, but I'm the truth, that's right, I fuckin' said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You, girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know? How'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rap and bitches, bitches and rappin'
Rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, "Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga," ah
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee know, see, I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowin' in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowin' in the South
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like?
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turnin' papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life I'm livin'
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
N-n-nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?

Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a lil' class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh

Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?

Well, aren't you a breath of fresh air?
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller, figure they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like “Voilà!” You do it right he just might buy you a car
Man, she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Bimmer
Champagne Range, triple-white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti

Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?

Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Showtime)
Go, go, go, go, go (As we proceed)

Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well, we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it, I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?

And like guns with the ink in, you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing (Young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited, yeah
You played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living, but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces?
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated, I have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh, yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)

Most of these things I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)

One of dem ones—right

Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, "What are those?"
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white Hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

Yeah, that's right, yeah

Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy?"
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house "the embassy"
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 p.m. like, "Where does the day go?"
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira

I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, I

I bought that bitch new Celine, I got rings, I got racks like Serena

More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out
More blessings for Sandi and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a "not guilty"
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still, they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, "This what we need to be on," but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge
I'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, "What have you done for me lately?"
"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest."
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?

And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (All we wanted was an opportunity)
Just Blaze (Lord knows)

It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bought 'em sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields, they makin' the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (Woo)
Places they say they've been, we actually goin' for real (Woo)
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin' (Woo)
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (Huh)
With my new bitch that's livin' in Palm Springs
Young-ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin' fun at
Never the flow, though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson, boost the rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

Huh
You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard, my nigga
I swear, homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal
(M-M-Maybach Music)

I fell in love with the pen, started fuckin' the ink (Huh)
The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica (Woo)
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival Cruise
And these niggas talkin' like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss (Huh), came to buy the bar (Huh)
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car (Woo)
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double-R (Woo)
Headlights flickin', lookin' like a falling star
Every day, them hammers bang, whippin' yay like Anna Mae
I run the game, but the ladies think I'm runnin' game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate
Rozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothin' short of great (Huh)

Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yellin' out, "Pay the guys"
Man, I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you know I had to—

Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say, "Okay, if you say so"
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it, yeah
I mean, for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to— oh, wait, sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off

Man, you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started

I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way

Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway

They still out to get me cause they never got me

They still out to get me, I don't get it

Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
Y'all don't understand, I'm the one they want to hear from
Y'all don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we 'bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Yeah, they don't love you like they used to (What you say?)
In the city with the- windows down
Like I used to (What you say?)
Like I
Take some to getting used to (What you say?)
Man, they don't love you like they used to, man

It’s a song about being away from what you love and hoping that when you’re gone, doing you, somebody out there misses you.… Read More 
I said, "Tell me what's really goin' on"
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on

Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said "If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em"
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!

Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah

Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing

You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin' (Stressin' over somethin')

You, you, you, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

Girl, your love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart
Girl, your love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart

Yeah
All you self-promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fuckin' game thankless
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since "No Scrubs" and "No Pigeons"
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down
Especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs
They hit my phone like, "You did that"
They even hit my line like, "Where you been at?"
It's always on some shit like
"When can I get a favor?" or, "Where my bitch at?"
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist
Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?"
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this
Yeah, I make you dance to this
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder
Sun shinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind

Yeah, and we can't stop
Make you dance to this, uh
I'ma make you One Dance to this
A-ha-ha-ha, ha
Bad breed, bad bwoy
Uh-huh, yeah
That's right, yeah

This song features vocals from frequent collaborator, The Weeknd.
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh

Summer's mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times, I'ma need it back
Wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
'Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now

Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh

But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

But don't you go getting married
Don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older
Don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer
But you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it
I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh

But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

Yeah

Never thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I'll say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together (6)
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga, out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google, yeah
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle, then take a girl to the movies
They been droppin' out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghostride
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin'
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready case we need to retire your jersey, yeah
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championship celebrations durin' regular season
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Aw, nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to "Closer to My Dreams"
Wide-eyed and uneducated at nineteen
I can't rap like that, all young and naïve
Not after all the shit I seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
Four thousand square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna see you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passin' to you all of the sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put they arm around you, now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number 'cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you
Or convince you that they care and see where it goes from there, but
These ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The hate is just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie, then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep the shit to ourself
Papi champú, young Pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I
Was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I.
And Young Dro was poppin' off with "Ain't I"
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doin' macarena
But, who am I to complain now? I'm still around, they know
Yeah

Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I'd done it, throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it, ahh

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

Uh, one thing 'bout music, when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin' I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me

The chopper like to feel on all the opps, it's a molester (21)
I be with my gun like Rozay be with lemon pepper
She wanna hear some Afrobeats 'cause she just popped a Tesla
All that workin' out, that nigga must think he a wrestler
But this ain't UFC, this chopper came with a compressor (21)
This chopper came with a compressor (Pussy)
This chopper came with a— (Pussy)
This Glock 4-5 came with a switch (21)
If I was Will Smith, I would've slapped him with a stick
Put your hands in the air, it's a stick-up (21)
Spin the same hood where I get my dick sucked (Facts)
If you standin' on business, put your blick up (21, 21)
Come around actin' scary, get your shit took (21)
Fell in love with feelin' dizzy, so I spizzin (21)
I got mad love for the boy, yeah, that's my twizzin (21)
If them niggas keep on dissin', slide agizzain (21)
We the reason why the opps ain't got no frizziends (21)
Last nigga played with me got turned duppy
I ain't even roll him in the 'Wood 'cause he musty
You ask how she doin', I just tell her come and fuck me
Shot his ass twenty times, damn, this nigga lucky (Damn, that nigga lucky)

Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
You don't like the way I talk? Nigga, say somethin'

Say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin'
You don't like the way I talk? Nigga, say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin'

I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself (Yeah)

No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

This is the 6’s year
Six hundreds instead of six, OVO
You know we’ll be rockin' our asses out
To my big brother Drizzy
You know what I’m sayin'?
More Life, 6 to the world, gang shit

Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (A lifestyle)

Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (Do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum
(They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man, you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl, you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me

They still out to get me, they don't get it
I cannot be got, and that's a given

They like, "Pablo—"
"Why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?"
"Why do you know every single bitch that I know?"
"Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?"
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago
South, south side, that's the motto
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, 'cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, ayy
Throne is back up in it, ayy
In the field like Emmitt, ayy, y'all get so offended, ayy
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'ma let you finish, but I
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki (Perfect)

Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (Lifestyle)

Real ting, ay
Yeah

I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see RiRi right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale, but you probably went to Howard, knowing you
Weekend in Miami, tryna study by the pool
Couple things due, but you always get it done
Might've been a time where I loved her too
But you take that away and you've always been the one, one
I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in they life as a wife
That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
Why you wanna fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wonderin' what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you—

B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddling
And my shit's so wet, you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row your boat
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team, so the deals is ill
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominatin' every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly, I'm flyin' high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
Could be a million, billion, trillion miles away
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star, sheriff badge
What's the point if I'm guardin'?
Double-D up, hoes, Dolly Parton

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
And all I can say is
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so—

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you

To get you under my pressure

I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
Yes, uh
Biggest, you feel me? (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

Godfather with a garden full of snakes
Call Porsche, time to give away a Wraith
Bricks, boy, time to turn 'em into base
Big Boi got me tryna buy the Braves
Courtroom soundin' like I'm in an opera
Went and got it, now these niggas wanna knock us
Bitches fallin' 'cause they need a couple dollars
But it ain't a problem 'cause a nigga really got it
Fat boy, rich nigga, with a appеtite
Countin' money all night under thе candlelight
Spinnin' vinyl, Teddy P, or is it Lionel?
Not a model, but I know I been your idol
Big bank, sparkin' weed without a lighter
On fire 'cause I'm just a different writer
Practicin' social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin' outta big trucks
Steppin' on my feet, it'll get you fucked up
Got the squad with me and all they did was gimme love
Foot Locker, twenty deep, a nigga spend a dub
G-Wagen for my bitch, now, girl, go live it up
Death Row, that's for these niggas, I'ma hit 'em up
Makaveli, it's all eyes on me
Pinkie rings, it's still M.O.B. (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
Tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'

Yeah, heart just turned purple
Three-sixty up front, it all comes full circle
Class photographs, Sandi had me on my Urkel
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Patty Mahomes, 'bout to fall short a couple hunnid
Signed, sealed, delivered, I forward the note to Republic
She witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, make a set sail in Croatia to get the leverage
Groundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges
I took two mill' out the cage down in the desert
Matthew Maddox called in the pit boss, double checkin'
"The number's all good, just pay me, I'm at the Rhino"
Real life, the whole fam' goons like Ralo
One truck in front of me, one behind me to follow
Lemme get a lemon pepper order, please
You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages
These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these are where my confessions live
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
I did brunch with the judge we appearin' before
Private villas only, I don't go near a resort
We want everything galore, not just Lira Galore
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
For real, and my city love me like DeMar DeRozan
I sent her the child support, she sent me the heart emoji
They all say they love me, but they hardly know me
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, dropped him off at school, big day for my lil' man
Recess hits, daddy prolly made another M
School bell rings and I'm out there to get him again
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed
Regardless of what they husbands do to provide
Askin' if I know Beyoncé or Nicki Minaj
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Of course
Pull up to the front in a fleet of Suburbans
Flooded French immersion with the Secret Service
Shit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose
If this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker
Champagne, ring bells in the streets of Jamaica
Started at the crib, look how far this shit'll take ya
Ross sittin' on two hunnid thirty-five acres
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
And that's facts, Hamdan Mohammed like my third cousin (Facts)
Mansoor Mohammed like my real brother (Facts)
Dubai embrace me like a Emirati (Facts)
All my Rolls-Royces got a different body (Facts)
Mansory, kitted out with every option (Facts)
Lemme know if that's a problem
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had it 'fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it
And if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it
I had it so long, I don't even celebrate it
Negative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix
'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, not too many parallels left in our lives
I mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes
And the squad look bigger to the young guys
And my dick feel better when you drunk, right?
Spend nighttime starin' at the sunrise
And my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye
Air Canada Centre nigga when I die
Y'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry
First couple rows, you gon' see the real guys
The ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause the trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like it's lunchtime
Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'
Livin' in the 6ix, eight weeks, sun blazin'
After that, the killies just go into hibernation
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Everybody that survive got survivor's guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills
My boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill
You niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk
And your albums like some mothafuckin' fire drills
It's like this shit feels real, but it's never real (Yeah)

I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure

Rider shit

Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who"
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who," yeah
And she like, "Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice

You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma, yeah
Hard labor let me pay the price

You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

I'ma just give it to you direct, instead of me throwin' this shit
You know you important and shit
You know I'm supportin' this shit
We used to do pornos when you would come over but now you got morals and shit
I got like four on the wrist and an adorable kid
I got a Drac' in the studio, and I don't just mean that I'm in this bitch
Please make the most of this shit
Don't just come close to some shit
I give you this bread, you run me some head
And then you go glow up a bit

She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to s—
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix, shawty is goin' legit
Shawty is goin' legit, me, I'm supportin' this shit
This is a story, it came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

Her daddy is not around, mama is definitely not around
She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight

She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to s—

Black boxes with the bow and rose
Zara heels bound to give ya Zara toes
Back that thing up, it's a wide load, shawty
I don't even know where the time goes, shawty
Know you got some brand new life goals
Baby blue, but you are not a baby, I know, shawty
I know, yeah
So, why you gotta be so hard-headed?
Why you wanna ask? Girl, you know what I did
Actin' like you don't  already know what that is
Baby, just relax, I'm on your side
I will not discuss it with nobody
Neither of our pasts 'bout to go away
You made me forget about it anyway
I know, I know
Black boxes with the bow and rose
Little side hustle with the Fashion Nova
Know we both came from a broken home, shawty
Mom and daddy didn't really get along, shawty
Heard you got some brand new life goals
Baby blue, but you are not a baby, I know, shawty
I know, know, know, know, know

I been hot since the birth of my son
I remain unfazed, trust, worse has been done
Man, fuck a valuation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold that already, got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy it
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Ollie got the first еdition parked up roadside
The only sign of strugglin' is coming from thosе guys
I'm tryna just relay what I can see through my own eyes
And nothin' tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that are high still
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
And then I'll come back to tell you how that feels
Built this house for us all, pain in my back still
You niggas gassed up, you couldn't pay the

I love you, I love you, I love you

Champagne poetry, these are the effortless flows, supposedly
Something else is controlling me
Under her pictures live some of the greatest quotes from me
Under me, I see all the people that claim they over me
And above me, I see nobody
I'd have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me
The twenty percent of you that we own is my tootsie's money
Nigga, I'm wilding with your bread, you owe it to me
CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
They don't want a problem with the boy, but it's goin' to be
Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be
Future sign the contracts, he don't even show it to me
I don't have to second-guess nothing with no one I love
'Bout to build a second guest house 'cause we growing too much
Think I got to scale the love back 'cause

I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean


Yeah, oh
Heavy day
For real
Yeah
Yeah

The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I haven't been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearin' me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me
My parents' divorce is on me
My therapist's voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me
The pressure is weighin' on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
I'm makin' the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
I'm bigger now than before
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?
How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
**** windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors
This the part where I don't ever say "Pardon me" anymore
This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for
This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure
You owe that shit to the boy, yeah

(I need to make you see)
I love you, I love you, I love you
(What you mean to me)
I need to make you see
(What you mean to me)
(What you mean to me)

Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure (Man, man)
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again (Six-six-six!)
Soon as you get in (Oh no, no)

Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
And I do

Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel
And don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care
Don't over-prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way
But, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go

Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you where you're from, where yo bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

Oh, and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hitting like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, six-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci, one do it, then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the door's open, and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy, I ain't even gotta call no one for it

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog

I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me, man
I hate that shit
It'll be a long time before y'all feel me
If ever
For real

You won't feel me 'til everybody say they love you, but it's not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fuckin' hates you and your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend ass keep gettin' thicker than the plot does
And when you forget her, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop, but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit right up your alley
Yeah, you see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It's feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
'Stead of gettin' a pat-down, they just keep on sayin' that they feel you, nigga, yeah
It's been too long
Been way too long

I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? Ooh, the ride

You won't feel me 'til you want it so bad, you tell yourself you're in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit card so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings
Where you record with two others that want the same things
Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you gettin' close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you 'bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Tellin' stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on tellin' you they feel you, nigga
Yeah
It's been too long, man

I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
I've been faded too long, ooh
Why won't it stop? (Yeah), the ride
Why won't it stop? (Uh), ooh, the ride

I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I'm drivin' right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold, especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking what's good at home?
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I should've known
My young niggas poppin' M's and sippin' dirty Jones
Problem children that all be reppin' October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growin'
Brand new titties, stitches still showin'
Yeah, and she just prayin' that it heals good
I'm 'bout to fuck and I'm just prayin' that it feels good
I really don't know much, but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money, more problems, my nigga, don't believe it
I mean, sure, there's some bills and taxes I'm still evadin'
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazin'
Young money-maker, season-ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches, still scorchin' as if I didn't notice
You niggas gettin' older, I see no threat in Yoda
I'm out here messing over the lives of these niggas that couldn't fuck with my freshman floater
Look at that fuckin' chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it
My junior and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga

Ooh
I'm still faded, faded, faded (The ride)
I'm still faded, faded, faded (Why won't it stop? Ooh, the ride)
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? Ooh, the ride

Never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it like it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it, and here I am
In the presidential, do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing movin' through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast, Lord
Seem like yesterday that I was up-and-coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here? The drink here? The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then

Uh, I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no (Say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)

Used to make us proud, we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man, uh
You keep talking how you was this and you had this
And you deserve some fuckin' credit, how did anyone forget it?
Got a show up in your city, your girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfuckin' time
You should take it as a sign, man, I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it, 'cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She says, "You're such a dog," I say, "You're such a bone"
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days, women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, "Show me some"
But girl, you ain't the only one that's tryna be the only one, uh
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then

Uh, I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no (Say no)

Ayy
Look

I wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from me
The first second they speak to me, I'm not with all the secrecy
Secretly beefin' me behind closed doors
But playin' it peacefully for the streets to see
My nigga, have some decency
Don't move like a puto
Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo
I made north of the border like Vito Rizzuto
Throwin' parties in Miami, they lovin' us mucho
With the ho ratio, I'm like David Caruso
Thеre's a mad shortage of peoplе givin' me kudos
I been doin' this since T-Pain was pourin' us Nuvo
You tell 'em I run the country, they'll say, "True, though"
Papi chulo, grippin' culo
And I got the flows niggas steal like boot toes
You boys reachin' new lows
Lettin' me take the rap for that Casper the Ghost shit
While you findin' all of the loopholes
You niggas move too cold
See the watch collection and assume I got time
'Cause of the ruby rose two-tone
Or switch it to the one I call "R.I.P. Nipsey"
'Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stones
Maybe I'm gettin' too stoned
Calacatta marble for my tombstone
Here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song
Or any of his old songs
They sing them shits like folk songs
Kumbaya, boom-ba-ye
Know the owl stay on me
Bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me
Tryna get the Earl Grey on me
But I ain't really into talkin' names
Only tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shame
Heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame
High fashion and my life is full of climaxes
And my wishes come true without blowin' eyelashes
Up in 'Bron crib, fishbowl wineglasses
That's how we passin' time
Hundred thousand on the line
At the table prayin' banker shows a natural nine
It never happens half the time
My losing nights are still a vibe
That's the things I accept
You over there in denial, we not neck and neck
It's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correct
Man, fuck a "Respectfully," I just want my respect
They tried to label me mean, I say what I mean
People that could've stayed on the team
They played in-between
Clouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supreme
Some of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seems
Had to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines
You niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to me
Told you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to please
I could give a fuck 'bout who designing your sneakers and tees
Have somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed
Trust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe
That's why your people not believers, they all leavin' ya
That's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya
You know the fourth level of jealousy is called medea
Isn't that an ironic revelation?
Give that address to your driver, make it your destination
'Stead of just a post out of desperation
This me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation
Why you over there tryna impress the nation?
Mind's runnin' wild with the speculation
Why the fuck we peacemakin', doin' the explanations
If we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation?
But let me digress on behalf of the association
I'll play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like Copenhagen
See, they gettin' loose with the lyin' like open cages
In the LaFerrari, my emotions racin', dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin'
Niggas textin' "Bro," but we are not of no close relation
I was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the payment
Somehow I'm the greatest in the game, to my own amazement
The greatest in the world, there's no debatin'
You boys 'bout to will me to defeat like we rollerbladin'
Far as the Drake era, man, we in the golden ages
Look at the total wages
And look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older ages
If we talkin' top three, then you been slidin' to third like stolen bases
Toss around Rollies with the frozen faces
They used to tell me back in the day, "Boy, you're going places"
Never understood where I could really take it

Is it all
I could be enough
Is it all
I could be enough
Is it

Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees (Ho)
Hands on your knees (Ho), hands on your knees (Now)
Shake that ass for Drake (Yup), now shake that ass for me
Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake (Yeah), now shake that ass for me

Ayy, I still got some love deep inside of me
No need to lie to me, I know you got a guy
He's not a guy to me
Just say goodbye to him, then take the ride to mе, ride to me
I still got some lovе deep inside of me
Please drag it out of me
You just might
Just might get that G-Wagon out of me
Please drag it out of me, please drag it out
Rollie gang, patty gang, rich baby daddy gang
I'm with Red like I'm at a Cincinnati game
Hood bitch, tat her gang 'fore she tat her name
Real bitch, held me down 'fore I had a name
Heard there's money on my head, what is that to me?
I put a hundred bands on him, he put a rack on me
We from two different worlds, but it's a match to me
The bend it over only time she turn her back on me (For real)

Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees (Ho)
Hands on your knees (Ho), hands on your knees (Now)
Shake that ass for Drake (Yup), now shake that ass for me
Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake (Yeah), now shake that ass for me

You been so good and you deserve to end your suffering
I need good dick and conversation, can you comfort me?
I got a feeling this is more than what we both would say
I got a feeling this is more than feelings
I can't let you get away
Feels good, but it can't be love
Ain't a damn thing that I'd do
Ain't a damn thing, oh

Bend that ass over (Oh), let that coochie breathe (Oh)
Shake that ass, bitch (Oh), hands on your knees (Oh)
Hands on your knees (Oh, bend it), hands on your knees (Oh)
Shake that ass for Drake (Uh), now shake that ass for me
Bend that ass over (Yeah), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch (Yeah), hands on your knees (Hands on your)
Hands on your knees (Hands on your), hands on your knees (Yeah)
Shake that ass for Drake, now shake that ass for me (Shake, shake, shake)

You like my voice, I turn you on
Red weave, it match my thong
He heard about me, know my song
I drive him crazy, can't leave me 'lone
Foreign trucks, I pull up
Thirty inches to my butt
Nails done, I'm fine as fuck
Niggas tryna see what's up

I'm lucky
I'm lucky
I'm lucky
I'm lucky

Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees (Ho)
Hands on your knees (Ho), hands on your knees (Now)
Shake that ass for Drake (Yup), now shake that ass for me
Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake (Yeah), now shake that ass for me


You know the root of it
You know the lies and you know the truth of it
I see the future and I can see you in it
Girl, I'm not stupid, so don't pull no stupid shit
I swear, poppin' my shit come with consequences
Post nut clarity, I came to my senses
I knew it was love when it started as a friendship
Askin' 'bout a baby, we should probably get a Frenchie
And take care of the dog
Take care of the dog
Until the dog days are over
The dog days are done
And you know I'm the one, I'm the one
The dog days are over, dog days are done
And you know I'm—

We was fuckin' night after night, I'll change your life
You ain't even know how to suck it right, I taught you right
You ain't even heard of Grace Bay 'til I bought the flight
You ain't even know how cold you was 'til I bought you ice
You can't even look at him the same, we a different type
You just text me trippin', I reply, "Have a safe flight"
Wanna stick around for the ride, baby, hol' on tight

Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm takin'
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason

Never had a lot, this is all I need
Lost individuals is all I see
Grab the top spot like "pardon my reach"
Woke up one day and it was all on me
If it comes down, it's gon' fall on me
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm takin'
Long way down from the heights I'm chasin'
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas
Girls checkin' in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turnin' off my phone for the night now, baby
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Some of my niggas don't love me
We should sit down before shit turns ugly
We should sit down since you said things about me

Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way

Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason

Niggas wanted to kill me and y'all still with 'em
Nigga, y'all chill with 'em, and y'all wonder why we not friends?
Best thing I can do is not build with you
When I could destroy you, that takes some fuckin' discipline
I could send a team to come drill you
I got a billion or two and I know where the fuck you live
Niggas gotta chill with talking gangsta
You should just thank us, humble yourselves a little bit
This ain't the same Shawn that you knew once
I don't shine shoes, uh, this ain't what you want, no
All that back and forth on the internet
Nigga, we don't tennis that, y'all gotta do something, yeah
Only thing we 'spect now is violence
Anything besides this, we playing violins, uh
I'm public enemy
Niggas wanted to kill me and y'all want me to be friendly
Niggas want sympathy after they wanted to end me
Be those closest to it be the very ones that envy
Shout out to the family
I don't want no friends no more, not many understand me
Everybody want something
You know the price of everything but the value of nothing
But everybody want something
You know the price of everything but the value of nothing

Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P. 
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason

198 ContributorsLight Up LyricsOn “Light Up,” Drake talk about his career, his riches and how he celebrates his success. Jay-Z, on the other hand, sticks to the same topics while also giving Drake advice about the rap game.
Uh, I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: "Nobody's workin' as hard as you"
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose - yeah!
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Ay Guru tell, tell homegirl to open that Ace right there...)
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights'll make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy, uhh
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov', fuck what the dummies talk, uhh
I don't do too much bloggin'
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
Mm, I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money — this'll do

Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

Ha, yeah

They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, "Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?"
They said, "Fucking right, they were the first to go"
It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With "I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, "Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say "What up, though?"
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians – them know it, but them can't do it
Some people still searching for this truth here

Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind

I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya

Rule number one, to be a boss-ass bitch (Uh-huh)
Never let a clown nigga try to play you (Okay)
If he play you, then rule number two (Okay)
Is fuck his best friends and make 'em yes men (Okay)
And– (Wow, that's how you feel?)
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin' my business and you show up
Up to no good, I should've seen the signs
Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try and get you off my mind

I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya

What the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga?! Custom down?!
What the fuck, I ain't smokin' hot?! Bust me down?!
You the same clown nigga that was runnin' me down?!
Now you all up in my…'cause you wanna be down?! (Okay)
(Wow, that's how you feel?)
