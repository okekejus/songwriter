Ayy, ayy, ayy
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami (-ami)
Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi (Julio!)
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now

Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico (Bih)
Say the word and we go (Say it)
You can be my freaka (Brrrt!)
Girl, I'll be your fleeko, Mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' ever leave
Shoppin' sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now, tell me, who's the fairest?
Is it you? (Is it you?) Is it me? (Is it me?)
Say it's us (Say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it

Well, here I am, baby, here I am, baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby

Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that
I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man

Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us all the stars are watchin'

There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now

So, baby, let's just turn down the lights

Oooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more

Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

Now I unzip the back to watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

So just turn down the lights
And close the door
Oooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby

Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door

'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doin' the same thing
Sayin', "There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of somethin' they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darlin', watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'
If that'll make you mine

'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day it'll rain, rain, rain

Oh, don't you say (Don't you say) goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't you say (Don't you say) goodbye (Goodbye)

I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'
If that'll make it right

'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day it'll rain, rain, rain

[Song 13: The Lazy Song]
90 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeThe Lazy Song LyricsHave you ever had one of those days you simply felt like you didn’t want to do anything?
That’s pretty much what Bruno Mars is trying to say.
Today, I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doin' anything, uh

I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I can't, nah
I'll be loungin' on the couch, just chillin' in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle, I'm the freakin' man

Oh-oh, yes I said it, I said it (Ooh)
I said it, 'cause I can (Ooh)

Today, I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doin' anything

Nothin' at all
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh
Nothin' at all
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh

Tomorrow, I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out, "This is great" (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah, I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry, pops, you'll just have to wait

Oh-oh, yes I said it, I said it (Ooh)
I said it, 'cause I can (Ooh)

Today, I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doin' anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair (Ooh)
'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit (Ooh)
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, today, I don't feel like doin' anything

I could have treated you better
I let you get away
There goes my happily ever after

Tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
Ooh, I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me, what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

Yeah, I'm still in love with you, darlin'
I know you feel the same
Oh, what's the point of both of us being broken-hearted?
I pray it's never too late

So tell me why, why can't we try and start again?

You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
I was your man and you were my girl

I spend all my money
Bought a big old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honeys
Oh yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start callin' my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me (You make a mess of me)
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do (No matter what you do)
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believin' my own lies
Like everythin' will be okay
Oh, I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much, I know, yes, I know

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me (You make a mess of me)

My fragile heart's been done so wrong
I wondered if I'd ever heal again

Oh, just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change (Oh)

I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

Yesterday has come and gone
And I've learn how to leave it where it is
And I see that I was wrong
For ever doubting I could win

Oh, just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change (Oh)

I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

Life's too short to have regrets
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
Only have one life to live
So you better make the best of it

I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking

[Song 26: Rest Of My Life]
6 ContributorsRest Of My Life Lyrics
Every day, I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but, what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today

Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh, how could I be so lucky?
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life

Seems like yesterday when she first said "hello"
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one

Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh, how could I be so lucky?
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life

Uh, no, I've never done this before
Never wanna do this again
Wrong turn on a dusty road
I did it to myself, I can't pretend
Well, I learned just a little too late
Good god, I must have been blind
'Cause she got me for everything
Everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy, I'm a gamblin' man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little Miss Snake Eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her doors
'Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma, ooh

Natalie
She ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie
She's probably out there thinkin' it's funny
Tellin' everyone
Well, I'm diggin' a ditch for this gold-diggin' bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm comin'
She better run

Uh, the good Lord better bless your soul
'Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be beggin' me, "Please, please, please"
And I'ma look at you and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me
Cry for me all night
I'll spend a life time in jail (Yeah, that's what I'll do)
I'll be smilin' in my cell (Yeah, thinkin' 'bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
Sure, there ain't no use in tryin'
Once I get my hands on you, I'ma, ooh

Natalie
She ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie
She's probably out there thinkin' it's funny
Tellin' everyone
Well, I'm diggin' a ditch
For this gold-diggin' bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm comin'
She better run

I shoulda known better (I shoulda known better)
'Cause when we were together ('Cause when we were together)
She never said forever (She never said forever)
I'm a fool that played in her game

Hey, Natalie
She ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie
She's probably out there thinkin' it's funny
Tellin' everyone
Well, I'm diggin' a ditch

Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day, baby
While I hide from the sun

It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like until you try

You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted
But baby, what for?

It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you try

You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just got to decide
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland, it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line, you can't change your mind
Yeah, I'm a monster, but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly, I've been feelin' insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was, you would run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line, and come back alive
But that's the price we paying when we living on the other side

You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand

You know, you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kiss my lips, you know, I start to feel wonderful
It's somethin' incredible
There's sex in your chemicals, oh
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free

Oh, moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

I know
I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around, they notice that I'm not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again
Good to see you again
On top of the world (Uh)
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright
Everything is alright

Oh, moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Oh, moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

Don't look down, no, don't never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Oh, moonshine

Do not ever quit, try and try and you can do it, do not give up (yeah)

If you want to catch a ball, but you are having no luck at all

It hits your belly, your chin and toes

You will catch that ball, yes this I swear

Do not give up, keep on going

Do not give up, don’t ever stop
Try and try and you will come out on top, do not give up

You got yourself new roller-skates
You put them on and you feel great
Stand up, but then you fall
Do not think you can skate at all
You get back up and then you trip
You skip and tip and slip and flip
Well try and try and try some more
And soon you are skating across the floor

Do not give up, keep on moving
You are going to get there just keep on grooving
Do not give up, do not pack it in
Try and try and you will win, do not give up
No no no, do not give up
No no no, do not give up
No no no, do not give up, no no
Do not give up

Just take my hand
Fall in love with me again

Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day

So let's runaway
Let's runaway, just for the day
Runaway, runaway

Girl, you've been so patient
Spendin' nights alone and not complaining
But I'll make it up to you
And I promise today I won't keep you waiting
Please give me this one chance
To remind you of everything we have
I won't give up, I'm too much in love
And I want you to know that

Just take my hand
Fall in love with me again

Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day

So let's runaway for the day
And I'll give everything in this moment
And I promise to make every day just like the day
Ohh

Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day

So let's runaway

[Song 41: Forget You]
3 ContributorsForget You LyricsI see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with her
Ha,ain't that some shh (ain't that some shh)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best I'm like
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo
Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess she's a xbox and I'm more of an atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
( she's a gold digger just thought you should know sugar)
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you
Ooh, ooh, ooooh

Wasn't enough I'm like

I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shh (ain't that some shh)
Though there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best I'm like
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo
Now I know, that I had to borrow
And beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryin to keep ya, trying to please ya
Cause being in love with you ain't cheap
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(she's a gold digger just thought you should know sugar)
(just thought you should know )
Ooooooh

Ooh! I really hate you right now

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you
Oo, oo, ooo

Though there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best, I'm like
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo
Now baby, baby, baby, why'd you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?

[Song 42: Talking to the Moon (Acoustic Piano Version)]
9 ContributorsTalking to the Moon (Acoustic Piano Version) Lyrics
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have, you're all I have

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon

Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away

Hands over my head
Thinking what else could go wrong
Would of stayed in bed
How can a day be so long?

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe

That for you, I do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again
For you

I missed the first train, stood out in the rain all day
(Little did I know)
But I caught the next train, and there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe

That for you, I do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again, oh

Oh, who ever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely
Yea, I am so glad I fine with you
Even though the day went so wrong
I wouldn't change a thing
Yeah, yeah

Oh, I'll do it, I'll
Do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again (Yeah, yeah, oh)
Do it all over again
I would do it all over again
I would do all over again for you
All I went through, led me to you
So I would do it all over again

Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely, oh
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely, oh

Feel your heart beating fast
Hold me close make it last

So take a breath leave me and
Was so scared of you leaving
Wish we could both just run
Wish we could run it off
But we can't stop time
Seems the clock is running too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask

I know it's hard, but we'll get through
Just hold on I promise you

Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind

[Song 45: Old & Crazy]
12 ContributorsOld & Crazy LyricsTrack 11 on “Unorthodox Jukebox”, Old & Crazy is a playful jaunt that finds Bruno really going retro — as in, saloon piano and jazz-era horns.

The track features Esperanza Spalding.
Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty, when my hair's grey?
Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?

Will you still hold my hand
When my clothes are out of style?
My teeth all ran away
And I don't have the same smile

Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty, when my hair's grey?
Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?


Will you still want to dance
Even if my hips are weak
My ears don't hear so well
And I can't find the beat?

Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty, when my hair's grey?
Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?

[Song 46: Who Is (Perfect)]
8 ContributorsWho Is (Perfect) Lyrics
Oh, I was perfect for the circus
If she dared me I'd do it
Love makes you stupid
I gave it up
But I guess it was not enough
'Cause she never seemed satisfied, oh

I know I'm not perfect (Oh)
But at the end of the day who is? (Oh)
She wanted someone that's perfect
Okay, but can you tell me who is?
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh oh)

She set the bar just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it, but I still kept on reaching
She watched me try at least a thousand times
If she loved me she'd stopped me, but no (Oh)

I know I'm not perfect (Oh)
But at the end of the day who is? (Oh)
She wanted someone that's perfect
Ok, but can you tell me who is?

I saw something worth my future
So wrong, so wrong
In my mind I was all it took, but I guess I wasn't wrong (Oh)

I know I'm not perfect (Oh)
But at the end of the day who is? (Oh)
She wanted someone that's perfect
Okay, but can you tell me who is?

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Song 48: All She Knows]
9 ContributorsAll She Knows Lyrics
Once again you're home alone
Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby

Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

You've been living this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
'Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one you are looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see

Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I can't pretend
Wish we were more than friends

She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal (Oh)
A heart that can't feel (Oh), it's broken (Broken)
His love is all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows, oh)
His love is all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (Damn)
His love is all she knows

I know girl, when you look at me
You don't know how I feel
Cause I am usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know

But I cannot hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Cannot wait no more
Oh, I can't wait no more

It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you

Maybe I am a fool for speaking up but I do not mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do

And the look that you are giving me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I will change my ways I will
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothing to lose
I have got nothing to lose

Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you

Not a place I would rather be
Just stay for a while
Then you will see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That is why I have to take this time baby to tell you
Oh, and now you know
And now you know

Wohooo Whoooo

How do I end up in the same old place
Faced again with the same mistakes
So stubborn thinking I know what is right
But life proves me wrong every time
Taking roads that lead me nowhere
How do I expect to get there
But when, oh when will I learn to just put you first

I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on
Can I move on
Oh

When I am weak it's you that makes me strong
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart
With you life is so easy why do I make it hard
Oh taking roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first

Hey!
I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on

I get out of my own way, let you have your way
Cause I realize I'm no good on my own
I'm there for you, I'll serve for you
I can't live without you. No

I come to you now when I need you, why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
With only you, only you, with only you
Can I move on, can I move on, can I move on

3 ContributorsNever Say U Can’t Lyrics
Oh 

When I was just a little boy
Barely strong enough to stand
I could always count on him
Oh
He thought me everything I know
And 'till this day it shows
He was more than just a friend (Ah ah ah)

There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't

Oh
Never say you can't
Oh oh oh Oh

So when last rain begins to fall
And you're out there on your own
And you can't see a thing
No no no
Just find a voice that understands
For me it was my old man
Taught me to say the words I can
Oh

There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't

Everything he taught me would stay with me forever
No I won't forget a thing
Oh because of dad I now know myself better
And I hope I can do for him what he did for me

How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't

Oh
Never say you can't
Oh
Never say you can't

Your hours when you had the chance
Take me too every party because all

Your selfish ways caused a good
Strong woman like me too walk out

Get to clean up the mess you've made

[Song 56: Before It Explodes]
3 ContributorsBefore It Explodes Lyrics
It's not a question of love
'Cause our love has never changed
But all the little things keep piling up
And life keeps getting in the way

Don't make it harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss?
And just let it go
And stop the madness before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes

Some things we won't understand
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood
So let's just turn and walk away
And hold on to what was good

Don't make it harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss?
And just let it go
And stop the madness before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes


Before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes

1 ContributorLights LyricsE-eh-eh-eh
You said that I was so not afraid
You said that I was just a 
But I'm not trying my best to owe it
You told me that I'm not to follow
And you only knew what you do, babe
If you only saw what I was
But I'm not trying to bet this only
Because you can't count my own deals on it
Oh I want to touch you with the lights on
Oh I want to freak you with the light-
My lonely girl you're my only girl
This is so not your fault
You're my only girl (Yeah)

[Song 58: Only When You’re Lonely]
2 ContributorsOnly When You’re Lonely Lyrics
Here I am again doing things I said that I wouldn't do
It's 3 am and I'm rushing out the door to see you
Waiting all day, but now you want to call me
Why do you do this to me all the time?

After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart
Because I loved you, loved you
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl
With no one to turn you
Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer
So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything

After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it
You just think of yourself and never me at all
If you're with your friends, you just string me along
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on

Because I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely

[Song 59: The Way You Are]
1 ContributorThe Way You Are LyricsIntro (J. Reyez):
Alright, I do this for all of you
I make music for love, the love of everything
J. Reyez... Bruno Mars...
C'mon!
Verse 1 (J. Reyez):
When I wake up next to you girl
It's like a dream and I'm stuck in two worlds
You're beautiful and you're always shining
Your happiness to me is worth more than diamonds
Many people are there, but you're worth keeping
The same letters, three words and one meaning
I love you, but we have our little arguments
That don't stop untill we forgot who started it
I blank out and the thoughts around in me
You and I, everytime you smiled at me
And I'm blessed, god's gift to me is you
Your eyes, the world I see in you
And time never goes to waste
Don't change, cuz you can never be replaced
This love, you can never rearrange
Everytime when I see your face
Refrain (Bruno Mars):
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

Verse 2 (J. Reyez):
Just the way you express with "ing" girl
You're nothing short of my everything
And every memory so sentimental
Your happiness is my essential
This a way for me to say thanks
No stress, I want you to give me strenght
When I'm hurting, you're so close to perfect
But to the world you're just one person
But to that person you mean the world is just
How we ride, me and my girl, uhh
We do this Bonnie and Clyde shit
We fall together, we coincided
The way to my heart it was hard to find it
But you found dead deep down inside of this love
You can never rearrange
Everytime when i see your face
Refrain (Bruno Mars):
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are (x2)
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah-ahh

4 ContributorsLost Lyrics
Damn

It's getting hard to breathe
I'm trying to make her see
That she do not really know that I
I'm trying to find a way to tell her every day
But she just goes along, so I

I do not wanna be the only one that knows
That somebody can come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing, shaking ground
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it

'Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head (losing my head)
I'm losing my mind (losing my mind)
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost

I'm already lost (lost, lost, lost)
Damn

I wish that I could see
What is making you
Feel that you should be concerned
My love is like a gunshot
All It takes is one shot for me to blow it all away

I do not wanna feel like I'm just wasting time
It's gotta be with you and no one else
Do you notice me
I need to know right now
'Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it

'Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head (losing my head)
I'm losing my mind (losing my mind)
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost

Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl you make me nervous
By now you should've noticed me
And what will it take
Do I have to lay across your door in chains
You're driving me insane

Girl, I'm losing my head (losing my head)
I'm losing my mind (losing my mind)
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head (losing my head)
I'm losing my mind (losing my mind)
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost

I'm losing my head (losing my head)
I'm losing my mind (losing my mind)
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head (losing my head)
I'm losing my mind (losing my mind)
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost

I'm already lost (losing my head, losing my mind)

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh (losing my head, losing my mind)

Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

I spend all my money
On a big, old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honeys
Oh yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do

Expression on her face
The look in her eyes says she wanted me
So I played it cool
But inside I knew
If I made my move
Then hand it for, she’s seconds away
Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I’m not the one, i’m not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind
Tripping out

Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
I’m tripping out

Got me thinking ’bout your love
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love
Time was standing still
A destiny fulfilled
Just watching her body movement all night long
Then she took my hand, instantly we danced
She knew by my angst that I wanted more

Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I’m not the one, i’m not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind

Got me thinking ’bout your love

Maybe if I jump or spread my wings
I know I've been wrong about these things
I don't care if no one else believes
I think that if you believe it then maybe we'll make it
Tonight
Oh tonight
If you believe in me like I believe in you
Tonight

Because impossible is possible tonight

Some about the day
Some about the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
Low like Kesha when she on the mic
Move on to another because she wasn't treated right
I could relate to that boy Drizzy
How did I wind up right here with you
you can achieve if you do believe
Got to chase your dreams true reality
No fantasy enjoy it while you have it
Relax and take it in
I tell as your friend your friend to the end


Some about the day
Some about the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
We could get together like it's New Year’s Eve
Met a lot of girls but is you what I need
I live life fast
Trying to hang on passenger
I need a companion on this campaign
Felt so much pain when the rain goes away believe in sunny days
One life to live got to be epic or I'll be Edward you can be my Bella

You go about your day, baby
While I hide from the sun
It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I will be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side

Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for?

If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly I've been feelin' insane In between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide (huh)
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we payin' when we livin' on the other side

You know I

Gave you all of me without question

If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run

Wipe those tears from your eyes; it's too late
With that rag in your mouth, can't tell what you say
Tied to the train tracks begging me for mercy
This is going to hurt you more than it hurts me
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run

You brought this upon yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch now shut up and take it
Look at the monster you created
You brought this up on yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch so shut up and take it
Now I’m a monster, monster you created
Yeah
Killer on the run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run...

Goodbye

It seems like every other night
You pick a fight fight

Be calling you out your name
This is not what lovers are supposed to do do
You tell me to go go

We fuss fight and scream
And it’s all because of our love
But you and I both know we never giving up

Every time I try to leave something tells me to turn around round round round
Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down down down
Cause I know we can work it out, work it out, talk it out, talk it out stick it out stick it out ooh ooh ooh
Every time I try to leave we find a way to figure it out
That’s why I always turn around

Sometimes you drive me crazy but I love you bay
All I ask is that you always appreciate me

Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open; why were they open? (Ooh)

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh, oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no, oh-oh-oh

Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face, then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash; yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh, oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire (No)
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames (No)
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

But darlin', I'd still catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Song 74: Girl In The Window]
3 ContributorsGirl In The Window Lyrics
Staring from my room I see them
Holding hands wish I could be them
Lovers doing what we use to do
(But I'm stuck here alone)
That's the way it's been here lately
You're too busy now to save me
Feels like you forget I'm waiting for you
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me

How do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not going to wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window

I know you're working that's why you're leaving
I will never argue your reasons
If this means that you believe in them
Oh time goes on and we're growing apart
Broken promises break my heart
Please don't give me a reason to say goodbye
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me


How can I be what you're saying
When you keep turning all the pages
Am I supposed to believe your words are true
Don't take advantage of me cause you know I won't leave you
I make sure you know I always want to see you
Whoa won't you do it for me too

Oh how do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not going to wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window

2 ContributorsThe First Time Lyrics
I feel like dancing the night away
Feels like just yesterday we danced for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh

Let's let the music keep our bodies awake
Feels like I'm touching you right now for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh

I think i might explode, this tension is so cold
And all this fighting between us is really getting old
We need a magic touch, before it all blows up
We've both had enough, we've both had enough
So let's just get away, go to that special place
Where we first met and on the floor my feet were swept away
Baby it's worth a try, I believe in you and I
Only takes just one night

Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again



Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again
Ooh

Yeah that's what you would say
You use to buy flowers even out on valentine’s day
You would surprise me with a dinner even though you just ate
But what happened? Baby, what happened?

We've been through some changes

What happened to the man that you were before?
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

If I pull some extra time you say that you just can't stay
Oh, if you leave me at home alone for just one more night
I promise, it's going to be the last time

And now you think that you can just do what you do

Her lips as bright as the sun
Her curves goes every which way

The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?

Her legs like a supermodel
She worn for them high heel shoes
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do

Just watch her get it

Tells me she wants to go

After this I'm taking you home
First and for most I dance with you
Get you in the mood

But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'm going to take you home even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare

He drinks his Jack with no Cola, 'cause he likes to feel the burn
His middle finger to the law, no this boy will never learn
Everything wrong about him, yeah, it turns me on, oh
We live the good life, sleep all day and party all night long
I know some girls like good boys
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go


Say what you want, but this boy gives me everything
He'll never hurt me or put me off, anything

And now I've fallen in love

I used to go out of my mind
Tryna' redefine the real meaning of love
I lost my dignity, forgot about me
I was so lost in us
I had to take hold, cause you had me
Stuck in the middle of nowhere

And my faith, it would shake
I know you're trying your best
To take me

Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way
For far too long
Dream maker now
Is taking your place
I'm no longer asleep
My heart is finally awake

So goodbye, good day
Farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
(Instrumental break)

You used to be
The man of my dreams
Only now it seems
You were just a nightmare
But this little light of mine
Told me "Open my eyes
There's more than darkness out there"

I'm not gon' run from ya
Imma walk from ya
I'm not afraid of ya
I've escaped from ya
And my faith is in place
In the night, I no longer see your face

Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way
For far too long
Dream maker now
Is taking your place
I'm no longer asleep
My heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day
Farewell, it's okay

Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long

And dust to us
Oooooohhhhhh

Imma walk from ya
I'm not afraid of ya
I've escaped from ya

I'm not gon' run from ya
Imma walk from ya

Circlin' the same block
Greenpoint to Flatbush
Checkin' every corner shop
Tappin' people's shoulders
Askin' if they know her
Every day’s the same
It's back to the train

[Song 104: I Wanna Be A Billionaire by OverTime, Bruno Mars, & Conceit]
1 ContributorI Wanna Be A Billionaire by OverTime, Bruno Mars, & Conceit LyricsI wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire
I ain't asking for much just a couple of bucks
So I can rub em together maybe get me some lunch
Maybe fly around the world somе day
So I can see the pretty lights wherе they know my name
Maybe open up a school for the hip hop
Maybe get a couple jewels for my wrist watch
Maybe take that one chick on a date
I'd pay god damn that be great
Maybe take my friends riding a limousine
Maybe even learn to fly with some little wings
Maybe even pay Bruno Mars
So I ain't feeling guilty for stealing his bars (my bad)
I ain't never really gonna be a billionaire
And I ain't never gonna be a millionaire
I just really wanna be anywhere
But ain't nobody care and there's music in the air

Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire
Ayo it's crazy
Young man I wanted to get rich
So I can floss and study
And things like that
Thank god I didn't
Cuz things would look different then
Ayo I wanna make dough
So I can make change
And maybe live in a world where children ain't slaves
Influence minds and maybe change times
Understand these words they're much more than rimes
I need my soapbox so I can shout at yall
And if I had a billion, yeah, I'd be standing tall
I'm just a little man but I've got big plans
My father said my (inaudible) can't contain my brain
Of course I wanna floss, but not that much
I'd rather kill cancer and aid's at all cost
Man I don't get it, I never play these catch
They get get get, but they never get back
To me that's just whack

I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

[Song 105: Phantom Planet]
1 ContributorPhantom Planet Lyrics
Will you, take me
To the planet, you're from?
Will you, take me
To the planet, you're from?

There's nowhere there can be someone as sexy as you
(Girl you know I'm right about it)
Maybe you're saying things to keep me from you
(When you tell me that your friends are all sexy too)
There's something special about the look in your face
(Never have I seen a smile like yours before)
If you'rе not really into getting with me
(Thеn I got a question for you)

Will you (Will you?), take me (Take me?)
To the planet (Oh baby), you're from? (Will you take me there?)
Will you (Oh), take me (Wanna go)
To the planet (Yeah), you're from?
(All women are beautiful where I come from)

You gotta be from something out of this world
('Cause they don't make 'em quite as bad as you on this planet baby)
Your eyes make me feel
(Like flying far away with you tonight)
Take me for a ride I wish that you will
(So look and tell me more about you)
Or maybe show me something else just as beautiful
(But you know that ain't happening)

Will you, take me
To the planet, you're from?
Will you, take me
To the planet, you're from?

(Hey) Can't imagine being in a place where everybody as fine as you
(Trust me, beyond your wildest dreams)
Couldn't live without it baby there's no doubt about it
(Okay then, come with me)

Will you, take me
To the planet, you're from?
Will you, take me
To the planet, you're from?

Will you, take me
To the planet, you're from?
Will you, take me
To the planet, you're from?
(You're from, you're from, you're from)

Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?

Gave you all I had, and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah), oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no
Uh

Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey" when you get back to where you're from

1 ContributorJust the Way You Are (Carl Louis & Martin Danielle Club Mix) LyricsOh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Causе you're amazing just the way you are
And whеn you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah
