[Song 1: Get Along]
15 ContributorsGet Along Lyrics
Met a man wearin' a T-shirt, said "Virginia is for lovers"
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said "All you're really given is the sunshine and your name"
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?

Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?

We find out when you die the keys to Heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?

Doublewide Quick Stop midnight T-top
Jack in her Cherry Coke town
Momma and Daddy put their roots right here
‘Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dawn school bus kickin’ up red dust
Pickin’ us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the vents

We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses
Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we’re all alright

Baptist church parkin’ lot, tryin’ not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin’ it to second base, but sayin’ you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend Daddy doesn’t like
Now he’s sittin’ out back, .30-.30 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light

We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses
Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we’re all alright
We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots

We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses

Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night

[Song 3: Better Boat]
8 ContributorsBetter Boat Lyrics
I ain't lonely, but I spend a lot of time alone
More than I'd like to, but I’m okay with stayin' home
My how the last few months have changed
I’m smilin' more despite the pain

I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learnin' how to build a better boat

I hate waitin', ain't no patience in these hands
I'm not complainin', sometimes it's hard to change a man
I think I'm stronger than I was
I let God do what he does

I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin'  out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learnin' how to build a better boat

I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
If it's workin', I don't know, when I get done the thing may not float
But I'm learnin' how to build a better boat

All he could think about was
"I'm too young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell, I'm just a kid myself
How am I gonna raise one?

All he could see were his dreams
Going up in smoke
So much for ditching this town
And hangin' out on the coast
Oh well
Those plans are long gone, and he said

There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all goodbye
There goes my life

A couple years of up all night
And a few thousand diapers later
That mistake he thought he made
Covers up the refrigerator
Oh yeah
He loves that little girl

Mama's waiting to tuck her in
As she fumbles up those stairs
She smiles back at him
Dragging that teddy bear
Sleep tight
Blue eyes and bouncing curls

He smiles, there goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you, daddy, goodnight
There goes my life

She had that Honda loaded down
With Abercrombie clothes and fifteen pairs of shoes
And his American Express
He checked the oil and slammed the hood
Said, "You're good to go"
She hugged them both and headed off to the West Coast

And he cried, "There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you, baby, goodbye"
There goes my life

There goes my life
Baby, goodbye
Baby, goodbye
There goes my life

Plowin' these fields in the hot summer sun
Over by the gate, lordy, here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up a throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face, she ain’t a foolin' me

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up her land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

We ride back and forth 'til we run out of light
Take it to the barn, put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft, sit, and talk with the radio on
She said she's got a dream and I ask what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
And one more teeny weenie ride before I take her home

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

Well, she ain’t into cars or pickup trucks
But if it runs like a Deere, man, her eyes light up

She thinks my tractor
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
While I'm chuggin' along
She likes the way it's pullin' while we're tilling' up her land
She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy
She thinks my tractor's sexy
She thinks my tractor's sexy

Yeah we got drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
Takin' pictures of people we thought were stars
It’s easy to give in to your heart
When you’re drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
When the song comin' out of the speakers
Was the band that you had on your t-shirt
We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me, and we were …

Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire

Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier
Said "Do you think we’ll live forever?" As we killed another beer
And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were laughin' until we were breathless
Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless
And comin' alive and we were…

Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire

Oh, yeah, yeah

Yeah, we were up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire

World all  on fire
We were setting
The world all on fire
We were setting
The world all on fire

[Song 7: Anything But Mine]
10 ContributorsAnything But Mine Lyrics
Walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile
Me and Mary making our way into the night
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides
The pinball bells, ski ball slides
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the streets
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet

And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

There's a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her
We both laugh cause we know it isn't true
But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you

But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

Oo, oo

And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine
Mary I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

Oo, oo

And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
Hey, I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

Sun tanned toes tickling the sand
Cold drink chilling in my right hand
Watchin' you sleep in the evening light
Resting up for a long, long night

'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down, yeah

All day long just takin' it easy
Laying in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleeping off the night before
'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more

When the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down


This old guitar and my dark sunglasses
This sweet concoction is smooth as molasses
Nothing to do but breathe all day
Until the big moon rises and it's time to play

When the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down
(When the sun goes down)
When the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down, yeah


When the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
She thinks Cracker's sexy when the sun goes down

Mh-mh-mh
We'll be feeling alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Uncle Kennys' hotter when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down, oh, we'll be grooving
When the sun sinks down, hey, Uncle Kenny
Over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

Looks like royal in a thrift store dress
Keeps my heart and her hair a mess
She goes where the wind suggests she goes, who knows
Got a spirit that can't be tamed
She's a calico pony on an open plain
I know I'll never be the same no more, for sure

She's a wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

You've never heard of her favorite band unless you
Been to Bonnaroo or Burning Man
She's Penny Lane in a Chevy van, she loves to love

She loves me wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

She'll be here until she runs
Some just have to chase the sun

She's a wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

A kaleidoscope of colors in her mind child
A touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile
So simple yet experimental
Innocent but still a little wild child

Wild child

Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around 'til I saw the neon lights
Of a corner bar, and it just seemed right so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
But he walked up, and said, "What'll it be?"
I said, "The good stuff"

He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said "You can't find that here"

'Cause it's the first long kiss on a second date
Mama's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said, "I'll have some of that"
We sat there and talked as an hour passed, like old friends
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, "That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed"

He said, "Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new T-shirt saying, "I'm a Grandpa"
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"

He said, "When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says, "I'm sorry," say, "So am I"
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
'Cause that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff

Talking to the mirror in their underwear

When the town goes blue and the lights blink red

I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

All the sheriffs said kid, you better slow down
All the preachers said it's the devil's playground
I wonder if they knew they were wasting their breath
All I ever heard was all the pretty girls said

I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights

Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight

Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Song 12: Don’t Blink]
12 ContributorsDon’t Blink Lyrics
I turned on the evening news
Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said "All I can say is."

Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said
"Best start putting first things first."
'Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip it over and start again
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth

Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

So I've been tryna slow it down
I've been tryna take it in
In this here today gone tomorrow world we're livin' in

Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

Now, don't blink
Don't blink
Life goes faster than you think
So don't blink
Life goes faster than you think
Don't blink
Don't blink
Life goes faster than you think

Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake

But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

You can say we’re done the way you always do
It’s easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they’re gonna say
We’re bad for each other, but we ain’t good for anyone else

But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

We don’t have to miss each other, come over
We don’t have to fix each other, come over
We don’t have to say forever, come over
You don’t have to stay forever, come over

But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

I've been up to my neck working six days a week
Wearing holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
Been dreaming of gettin' away since I don't know
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico

No shoes, no shirt and no problems
Blues, what blues? Hey, I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt and no problems
No problems

Want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
Wanna look through my shades and see you there with me
Wanna soak up life for a while in laid back mode
No boss, no polite, no stress, no dress code

No shoes, no shirt and no problems
Blues, what blues? Hey, I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, and no shirt and no problems
Babe, let's get packed tank tops and flip-flops if you got 'em
No shoes, and no shirt and no problems
No problems

Baby, here I am again
Kicking dust in the canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hellbent on getting high
High above the lights of town

You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
There were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

When it comes to you
Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins
That do you in

You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

Never enough
You and tequila
You and tequila make me crazy

One word, that's all you said
Something in your voice called me, turned my head
Your smile, just captured me
You were in my future as far as I could see
And I don’t know how it happens, but it happens still
You asked me if I love you, if I always will

Well you had me from hello
I felt love start to grow
The moment I looked into your eyes you won me
It was over from the start you completely stole my heart
And now you won't let go
I never even had a chance you know
You had me from hello

Inside I built a wall
So high around my heart, I thought I'd never fall
One touch, you brought it down
The bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
And I swore to me I wasn't going to love again
The last time was the last time I'd let someone in

But you had me from hello
I felt love start to grow
The moment I looked into your eyes you won me
It was over from the start you completely stole my heart
And now you won’t let go
I never even had a chance you know
You had me from hello

That’s all you said
Something in your voice calls me, turns my head
You had me from hello
You had me from hello
Girl, I've loved you from hello

Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on 49
Man I can see the lights
School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile

And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

Temperature says 93
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimming hole
It's nice and cold

Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs

And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

The more things change
The more they stay the same
Don't matter how old you are
When you know what I'm talking 'bout
Yeah baby when you got

Two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle Rollin on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

This is a tortured soul song. If you get going with somebody, you’ve been in a relationship and for whatever reason she’s gone or you’re gone. And you’re not necessarily in… Read More 
If you're going out with someone new
I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me
I'm getting drunk, but I'd much rather be

Somewhere with you, laughing loud on a carnival ride
Yeah, driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
You said, "Pick me up at three a.m."
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you

I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up that ex to rescue me
Climb in their bed when I'd much rather sleep

Somewhere with you, like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear
"I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go"

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high
'Cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you

If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always

Somewhere with you, laughing loud on a carnival ride
Yeah, driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
You said, "Pick me up at three a.m."
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high
'Cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you

Somewhere with you
I'm somewhere with you
I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you
Somewhere with you

[Song 19: I Go Back]
15 ContributorsI Go Back Lyrics
"Jack and Diane" painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

I used to rock all night long to "Keep On Rocking Me Baby"
Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now "Only The Good Die Young" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back

I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back (I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back, I go back, I go back

[Song 20: Take Her Home]
6 ContributorsTake Her Home Lyrics
Downtown looks like it's New Year's Eve
You find some bar you can halfway breathe
TouchTunes some old deep-cut Cheap Trick
Got your girl singin' every word of it
So you bring a couple shots of chilled Patron
To the prettiest thing that you ever hit on
And somehow she ain't got a boyfriend
So you make her laugh all night and then

Take her home, fall in love
Thank the good Lord up above
That He sent one down into your arms
And put a chain around your raised-hell heart
You try to play it cool walkin' through the door
But you're smilin' like a fool 'cause you can't wait for
Them down-thе-road memories you're bound to makе
And you will one day take her home

Got a stuffed truck sittin' in the driveway
In the back there's a black and a pink suitcase
She can't stop sayin' she's freakin' out
You say, "Baby, you ain't got nothin' to worry about"
Then you hold her hand, kiss her one time
And throw it in drive

And take her home, and fall in love
Thank the good Lord up above
That He sent one down into your arms
And put a chain around your raised-hell heart
You try to play it cool walkin' through the door
But you're smilin' like a fool 'cause you can't wait for
Them down-the-road memories you're bound to make
And you will one day take her home

Take her home

Sometimes God draws life like a dream
Paints you a seven-pound five-ounce scene
In a car seat creepin' down the interstate
Two young lovers that are scared to death but still can't wait

To take her home, fall in love
Thank the good Lord up above
That He sent one down into your arms
And put a chain around your raised-hell heart
You try to play it cool walkin' through the door
But you're smilin' like a fool 'cause you can't wait for
Them down-the-road memories you're bound to make
And you will one day take her home

(Take her home, take her home, take her home)
Take her home
(Take her home, take her home, take her home)

It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape
And that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
But today, the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door

'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Too busy taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a foolproof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day

[Song 22: Knowing You]
7 ContributorsKnowing You Lyrics
Knowing you, you probably got your toes in the sand
At a bar on a beach in the sun somewhere
Knowing you, you got something cold in your hand
Chatting up a stranger without a care
Knowing you, you're still wild and free
And knowing you, you're probably way over me

But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you

Knowing you was a free-fall from a hundred thousand feet
When you don't even care where you land
And knowing you was the kind of rush that you feel
When you finally get to sit in with the band
And knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you

Knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

'Cause God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good
I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you

[Song 23: Tip of My Tongue]
7 ContributorsTip of My Tongue Lyrics
I love the dimples in the small of your back
The way they're speaking to me just like that
Red wine made my imagination run
Oh, I can taste it on the tip of my tongue

Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang on to anything you can hold

It's a long way down
To where I wanna go
It's a long way down
To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

Girl, believe me when I say it's true
Nobody makes me feel the way you do
Well, I love you from the morning 'til the setting sun, yeah
I can taste the ocean on the tip of my tongue

Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang onto anything you can hold

It's a long way down
To where I wanna go
It's a long way down
To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

It's a long way down
It's a long way down

It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

I wanna love you 'til my days are done
I wanna tell you that I think that you're the one
Oh girl, you know when it's all said and done
Everything about you's on the tip of my tongue

When I feel that chill, smell that fresh cut grass
I'm back in my helmet, cleats and shoulder pads
Standing in the huddle listening to the call
Fans going crazy for the boys of fall
They didn't let just anybody in that club
Took every ounce of heart and sweat and blood
To get to wear those game day jerseys down the hall
Kings of the school man, were the boys of fall

Well it's turn and face the Stars and Stripes
It's fighting back them butterflies
It's call it in the air, "Alright yes, sir we want the ball"
And it's knocking heads and talking trash
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass
It's I got your number, I got your back when your back's against the wall
You mess with one man you got us all
The boys of fall

In little towns like mine that's all they got
Newspaper clippings fill the coffee shops
The old men will always think they know it all
Young girls will dream about the boys of fall

Well it's turn and face the Stars and Stripes
It's fighting back them butterflies
It's call it in the air, "Alright yes sir we want the ball"
And it's knocking heads and talking trash
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass
It's I got your number, I got your back when your back's against the wall
You mess with one man you got us all
The boys of fall

Well it's turn and face the Stars and Stripes
It's fighting back them butterflies
It's call it in the air, "Alright yes sir we want the ball"
And it's knocking heads and talking trash
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass
It's I got your number, I got your back when your back's against the wall
You mess with one man you got us all

We're the boys of fall
We're the boys of fall

[Song 25: Boston]
4 ContributorsBoston Lyrics
She comes from Boston, works at the jewelry store
Down in the harbor, where the ferries come to shore
She never really knew how good it would feel
To finally find herself in a place, so warm and real

She wears a Red Sox cap to hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England, is different now and dead
In all the local bars, she flirts and tells the boys
While they're talking, she's from Boston

She comes from Boston, talks to her family, now and then
Through e-mails and post-cards, she tries to explain to them
That education and occupation will have to wait for now
She loves the Rosta Reggae rhythms, her dreams have changed somehow

She wears a Red Sox cap to hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England, is different now and dead
In all the local bars, she flirts and tells the boys
While they're talking, she's from Boston

Her toes dig deep and deeper in the sand
She's seduced by the sunsets and her new life at hand

She wears a Red Sox cap to hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England, is different now and dead
In all the local bars, she flirts and tells the boys
While they're talking, she's from Boston

She wears a Red Sox cap to hide her baby dreads

From Boston
She came to this island from Boston

[Song 26: Wherever You Are Tonight]
5 ContributorsWherever You Are Tonight LyricsDon't know where I was when I first heard
That you had left for parts unknown
I struggled some to find the word
To convince myself that you were gone
If where we go defies all explanation
And on my pain there came a revelation
Hearts will break, we cry, we grieve
We die, we go, but never leave
We linger in the lives of those wе love
We’re flеsh and bone in beams of light
A body breaks, a soul takes flight
And faith is left to heal what tears can’t touch
You’re not gone, just out of sight
You’re here with me, wherever you are tonight
I am better now for who you were
You always found the truth in me
More patient than this world deserves
Everything a friend should be
If heaven is our final destination
The love we leave behind is our salvation
Hearts will break, we cry, we grieve
We die, we go, but never leave
We linger in the lives of those we love
We’re flesh and bone in beams of light
A body breaks, a soul takes flight
And faith is left to heal what tears can’t touch
You’re not gone, just out of sight
You’re here with me, wherever you are tonight

We’re flesh and bone in beams of light
A body breaks, a soul takes flight
And faith is left to heal what tears can’t touch
You’re not gone, just out of sight
You’re here with me, wherever you are tonight

7 ContributorsMe and You Lyrics
Ordinary? No
Really don't think so
Not a love this true
Common destiny
We were meant to be
Me and you
Like a perfect scene
From a movie screen
We're a dream come true
Suited perfectly
For eternity
Me and you

Every day, well, I need you even more
And the nighttime too
There's no way I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to

Every day I live
Try my best to give
All I have to you
Thank the stars above
That we share this love
Me and you

Every day, well, I need you even more
And the nighttime too
There's no way I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to

Ordinary? No
Really don't think so
Just a precious few
Ever make it last
Get as lucky as
Me and you

Me and you

[Song 28: Pirate Flag]
16 ContributorsPirate Flag Lyrics
Well, I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around
Moonshine, that's where they make it
Put it in a jug, makes you wanna get naked
But I jumped on a Greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long, strange trip

I spent my whole life running around (Running around)
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well, I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

Well, my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willing and able
Don't know what makes you say, "What the hell?"
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something 'bout it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance

I spent my whole life running around (Running around)
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well, I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

A pirate flag and an island girl (Island girl)

Well, I remember back home 'neath the big old moon
Tucked back in the woods, yeah, life was good
But here we are in a local bar
And drinking shooting stars

I might spend my whole life running around (Running around)
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well, I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl

A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl

7 ContributorsHere and Now Lyrics
Seen the skyline of New York City
Fireflies in Tennessee
Sipped a little shine from a paper sack that'll
Knock the horns off a Cadillac
I must've sat on a dozen islands
Watched the sun sink into the sea
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt and hat
But my favorite place to be is

Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time
Than here and now
Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

Think I fell in love for the first time
With a girl from Mexico
Thought I found a true love in Malibu, but
That water was a little too cold
Yeah, I left a few tears in the rearview
One or two that were hard to forget
Why you think we call the present the present?
'Cause there ain't no better gift than

Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time
Than here and now
Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

A lotta people dreaming 'bout one-day-some-days
Waiting just around the bend (Waiting just around the bend)
I used to be one wonderin' when they'd come
But now I'm livin' in (But now I'm livin' in)
Here and now
Yeah, I'm livin' in the

Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time
Than here and now
Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

7 ContributorsWho You’d Be Today Lyrics
Sunny days seem to hurt the most
I wear the pain like a heavy coat
I feel you everywhere I go
I see your smile, I see your face
I hear you laughing in the rain
I still can't believe you're gone

It ain't fair: you died too young
Like the story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been thru
Just knowing no-one could take your place
An' sometimes I wonder
Who'd you be today?

Would you see the world? Would you chase your dreams?
Settle down with a family
I wonder what would you name your babies?
Some days the sky's so blue
I feel like I can talk to you
An' I know it might sound crazy

It ain't fair: you died too young
Like the story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been thru
Just knowing no-one could take your place
An' sometimes I wonder
Who'd you be today?

Today, today, today
Today, today, today


Sunny days seem to hurt the most
I wear the pain like a heavy coat
The only thing that gives me hope
Is I know I'll see you again someday
Someday, someday, someday

[Song 31: Better As A Memory]
5 ContributorsBetter As A Memory Lyrics
I move on like a sinners prayer
Letting go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
Getting reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleed
My only friends are pirates
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

Never sure when the truth won't do
I'm pretty good on a lonely night
I move on the way a storm blows through
I never stay, but then again, I might
I struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure until I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build walls too high to climb out
But I'm honest to a fault
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

I see you leaning, you're bound to fall
I don't want to be that mistake
I'm just a dreamer and nothing more
You should know it before it gets too late

Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel
You never know where they're gonna land
First you're spinning, then you're standing still
Left holding a losing hand
But one day you're gonna find someone
And right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seeking's done
It was just a part of the passing through
Right there in that moment you'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man
Better as a memory than as your man

Shift work, hard work
Tired body and a blue-collar shirt
And a baseball cap
Union-made
He's hot, sweat drops
'Round the clock, the door never locks
And the noise never stops
Night or day

Workin' seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven

Shift work, tough work
For the busy convenience store clerk
Two feet that hurt
Goin' insane
She's mad at some lad
Drove off and didn't pay for his gas
And he won't be the last
'Round-the-clock pain

Workin' seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven

I'm talkin' 'bout a bunch of shift work
A big ol' pile of shift work
Seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven

Well, I worked shift work
For ten years, man, I hated that work
Then I made a break
With the money I saved
It took me to the beach
To have a beer by the edge of the sea
In this 'round-the-clock place
I drank my money away

We partied seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven

I'm talkin' 'bout a bunch of shift work
A big ol' pile of shift work
Seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven

I'm talkin' 'bout a bunch of shift work

Oh, there's a river that winds on forever
I'm gonna see where it leads
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted
I'm gonna stand on the peak
Out there's a land that time don't command
Wanna be the first to arrive
No time for ponderin' why I'm a-wanderin'
Oh, while we're both still alive

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
If you won't I must say my goodbyes to thee

Oh, there's an island where all things are silent
I'm gonna whistle a tune
Oh, there's a desert, that's size can't be measured
I'm gonna count all the dunes
Out there's a world that calls for me, girl
Headin' out into the unknown
Way-fair with strangers and all kind of danger
Please don't say I'm goin' alone

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
If you won't I must say my goodbyes to thee

I wasn't ready to die for you, baby
Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay
What good is livin' a life you've been given
If all you do is stand in one place?
I'm on a river that winds on forever
Follow 'til I get where I'm goin'
Maybe I'm headin' to die but I'm still gonna try
I guess I'm goin' alone

Looking back now, well, it makes me laugh
We were growing our hair, we were cuttin' class
Knew it all already, there was nothing to learn
We were striking matches just to watch 'em burn
Listen to our music just a little too loud
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd
Heading to the rapids with some discount beer
It was a long train trestle but we had no fear

And man, I don't know
Where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that

We were wannabe rebels who didn't have a clue
In our rock 'n' roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young

Talked a good game when we were out with the guys
But in the backseat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change

And man, I don't know
Where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that

We were wannabe rebels who didn't have a clue
In our rock 'n' roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young

Young
Yeah, wishing we were older
Young
Hey, I wish it wasn't over

And man, I don't know
Where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that

We were wannabe rebels who didn't have a clue
In our rock 'n' roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young

And wishing we were older
And I wish it wasn't over

9 ContributorsEveryone She Knows Lyrics
Everyone she knows is getting married
All the girls who used to get around
Cut their hair up to their shoulders
Spend all their Sundays sober now
And everyone she knows is having babies
They got tired of fighting with the clock
And her mama's always asking
If she's ever gonna have one

She's bored with all the boys
And the men are too damn old
She's sick of summer love
But the winter's just too cold
She's a Marilyn in blue jeans
With a touch of Jackie O
She's stuck between seventeen
And everyone she knows
Everyone she knows

Everyone she knows is buying houses
Even though their husbands don't come home
Don't call their exes up to fix it
If they do, they don't admit it, no, no, no
Everyone she knows is getting healthy
She still smokes a couple when she drinks
But the bars are getting harder
They don't ever card her

And she's bored with all the boys
Men are too damn old
She's sick of summer love
But the winter's just too cold
She's a Marilyn in blue jeans
With a touch of Jackie O
She's stuck between seventeen
And everyone she knows
Everyone she knows

She goes out on Saturday night
She comes home late, she don't have to fight
And she thinks, "Ain't got it all, but I got it alright"
And for a minute she's glad that she ain't like
Everyone she knows

She's bored with all the boys
Men are too damn old
She's sick of summer love
The winter's just too cold
She's a Marilyn in blue jeans
With a touch of Jackie O
She's stuck between seventeen
And everyone she knows
Everyone she knows
Everyone she knows
Everyone she knows
Everyone she knows

[Song 36: Song for the Saints]
8 ContributorsSong for the Saints LyricsThis song was written while Kenny’s second home, St. John which is located in the US Virgin Islands, was being pummeled by Hurricane Irma in 2017.
He told Billboard:
I’ve spent the majority of my adult life… Read More 
Long before a boat anchored the harbour
Long before steel drums filled the breeze
God lifted these islands from the ocean
They stood strong for centuries

So it's fitting they were named after men with golden halos
'Cause angels don't give in just 'cause a little wind blows

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood, sweat, and tears and a new coat of paint
We're just a sinner's choir singin' a song for the saints
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

For the farmer in the field of sugar cane
For the drunkard in his hammock, dryin' out after the rain
For the teacher in the classroom, kid kickin' cans in the street
For the captain and his bar mate, prayin' down on bended knee

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood, sweat, and tears and a new coat of paint
We're just a sinner's choir singin' a song for the saints
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

This brokenness will heal, this weakness will be strong
Let's lift our voice together as the saints go marchin' on

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood, sweat, and tears and a new coat of paint
We're just a sinner's choir singin' a song for the

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood, sweat, and tears and a new coat of paint

I been hanging round this place, I been looking through your space
I been waiting' for you, I've been waiting' for you
All the places that you go, all the people that you know
I've been looking for you, I've been looking for you

And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got something in their pockets, all got something on their face
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard
Singing' hallelujah while they dance over the stars
They all say they're going' far

Me I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night looking for your footprints in the sand
Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along
While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song
Were you even here at all?

Me I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight
Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked
These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say
And if you ever were here baby they ain't giving' you away
Now it's been two days

I'm still looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got something in their pockets, all got something on their face
Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night looking for your footprints in the sand

Think I'll go back to the city, back to El Cerrito Place
That's the last time that I saw that pretty smile upon your face
I've been looking for you baby

[Song 38: How Forever Feels]
7 ContributorsHow Forever Feels Lyrics
Big orange ball, sinking in the water
Toes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter
Little umbrella shaped margaritas
Coconut oil, tanning señoritas
Now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels
Hands on the wheel, cruising down the interstate
Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away
I was going as fast as a Rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
Now I know how Richard Petty feels

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some living, yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

Saved two months, bought a little diamond
Tonight’s the night, feels like perfect timing
Down on one knee on momma's front steps
Man I'm going to die if she really says yes
I want to know how forever feels

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some living, yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

I want to know how forever feels
Hey, I want to know how forever feels
Girl, I want to know how forever feels

I wish I was a pirate ship wrecked down in Mexico
Where the oceans turn to silver and the beaches turn to gold
I'd make love to some señorita in that town
Then I'd get on my boat and I'd sail the ocean 'round

I wish I was a pirate out there under my own flag
Runnin' for no reason and no reason to turn back
Salt and rum on my tongue, sails tattered and torn
Laughin' in the devil's face, ridin' out a storm

Ooh, one of these days
Gonna get off of this highway
Wake up in some bay
With sunshine on my face
St. Christopher on a silver chain
Say a prayer, sail away


Ooh, one of these days
Gonna get off of this highway
Wake up in some bay
With sunshine on my face
St. Christopher on a silver chain
Say a prayer, sail away

I wish I was a pirate on some ghost ship in the night
With nothin' but the stars, the moon, and faith to be my guide
Steady as she goes, with my back to the wind
Then in a cloud of cannon smoke I'd disappear again

[Song 40: Flora-Bama]
10 ContributorsFlora-Bama Lyrics
Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
In the same night

There's ball caps, photographs, dollar bills and bras
License plates from every state nailed up to the wall
Spring breakers, heart breakers, already getting loud
Talladega's on the big screen, don't it make you proud?

Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Can't say I got a whole lot of cares
I'm in the redneck riviera
It's getting crazy, getting hammered
Sitting right here at the Flora-Bama
At the Flora-Bama

There's hot time, low tide, years of history
Hurricanes with different names that almost took the beach
The sign that says "live your life" just for inspiration
Gonna raise a lot of hell tonight in the, in the no shoes nation

Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Can't say I got a whole lot of cares
I'm in the redneck riviera
It's getting crazy, getting hammered
Sitting right here at the Flora-Bama
At the Flora-Bama

Got your "who that?", go Vols, roll tide and the Seminoles
Old dogs, war eagle, green-eyed gator, that's barely legal

Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Can't say I got a whole lot of cares
I'm in the redneck riviera
It's getting crazy, getting hammered
Sitting right here at the Flora-Bama
At the Flora-Bama

Don't it feel good?
Don't it feel good?
Yeah, don't it feel good?
At the Flora-Bama
Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Sitting here at the Flora-Bama

[Song 41: Seven Days]
5 ContributorsSeven Days Lyrics
A Saturday downpour carved out rivers in the sand
She said it was her first time to see the sea
Helping her climb across those jetty rocks
Was the first time I touched her hand
The rain and the way that felt never let up all week

By Thursday I knew everything about her
And God, the last day I didn't want to leave without her

The sidewalks, the streets were soaked
The sky was gray, but you should have seen her face
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
And the way she called my name
I've lived those seven days a thousand times
Those seven days a thousand

Time was like the tide, it came and went
That old pier ran clear out into the mist
My mind plays back that Tuesday night again and again and again
I taste that saltwater taffy on her lips

Wednesday morning snuck in through the window
We just laid there and listened to the waves come and go

The sidewalks, the streets were soaked
The sky was gray but you should have seen her face
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
And the way she called my name
I've lived those seven days a thousand times
Those seven days a thousand

Moments with her, now they're all a blur
Except for every second and every word
Every drop of rain, every single grain of sand

The sidewalks, the streets were soaked
The sky was gray but you should have seen her face
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
And the way she called my name
I've lived those seven days a thousand times
Those seven days a thousand  times

Seven days a thousand times
A thousand times
Seven days a thousand times

[Song 42: Beer In Mexico]
5 ContributorsBeer In Mexico Lyrics
Staring out into the wild blue yonder
So many thoughts to sit and ponder
'Bout life and love and lack of
And this emptiness in my heart
Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should try to grow up
But who knows where to start

So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen them both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just trying to search my soul
From the answers and the reasons why
I'm at these crossroads in my life
And I really don't know
Which way to go

So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

Maybe I'll settle down, get married
Or stay single and stay free
Which road I travel
Is still a mystery to me

So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

Down in Mexico

[Song 43: Old Blue Chair]
5 ContributorsOld Blue Chair Lyrics
There's a blue rocking chair
Sitting in the sand
Weathered by the storms and well oiled hands
It sways back and forth with the help of the winds
Seems to always be there, like an old trusted friend

I've read a lot of books
Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life where it's going, where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield, but nothing compares
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it when I sit in that old blue chair

From that chair I've caught a few fish and some rays
And I've watched boats sail in and out of Cinnamon Bay
I let go of a lover that took a piece of my heart
I prayed many times for forgiveness and a brand new start

I've read a lot of books
Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life where it's going, where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield, but nothing compares
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it when I sit in that old blue chair

That chair was my bed one New Year's Night
When I passed out from too much Cruzan and Diet
And woke up to a hundred mosquito bites
I swear got them all sitting right there
In that old blue chair

There's a blue rocking chair
Sitting in the sand
Weathered by the storms and well oiled hands

[Song 44: Happy Does]
7 ContributorsHappy Does Lyrics
Ol' Sunoco Charlie drives an '87 Harley
Sells gasoline and what you drink 8 to 3 AM
Got a tattoo for the Corps and ex wife number four
Hummin' along, schoolin' you on the songs on his station
He could be another one cussin' the government, nah, but he smiles
Got hundred reasons not to, but he's the poster child for

Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
Yeah, happy is as happy does

Some find it in the scripture or a Polaroid picture
Or flip a coin, heads, you're goin' to Tucson, Arizona
But it damn sure ain't in the lookin' back on the stuff you never did
Sometimes, you're gonna feel that, but life is better when

Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
'Cause happy is as happy does

She's a long way from the old her
In this mountain dive in Boulder
Every pickle jar, crinkled dollar
Takes her another mile high

Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
When it's all black clouds, find the sun
'Cause happy is as happy does

Happy is as happy does
Laugh and live with a half-full cup

8 ContributorsDown the Road LyricsDown the Road is Chesney’s cover of Mac McAnally’s 1990 song by the same name.  Chesney’s cover featuring McAnally charted considerably higher than the original.
When I was a boy

Four houses down from me
Was a family with an only child
She was the only girl
In this whole world that could make me smile

Down the road
I made up reasons to go
Down the road

Somewhere inside of me
There was something she took a liking to
Well, I asked her to marry me
She said she really wanted to

Down the road
To see what life's gonna hold
Down the road

Her mama wants to know
Am I washed in the blood or just in the water?
Her daddy wants to know
If I make enough to take his daughter

Down the road
Before he can let her go
Down the road


Now down the street from here
There's an engineer with an only son
And our baby girl
Says she believes that he is the only one

Down the road

Her mama wants to know
Is he washed in the blood or just in the water?
And I wanna know
That he makes enough to take my daughter

Down the road
When it comes time to go
Down the road
Down the road
You know I wanna help her go
Down the road

Down, down, down that road
Down, down, down that road

14 ContributorsNoise Lyrics“Noise” is the first single off of Kenny Chesney’s upcoming 2016 album, currently untitled. It was released to radio on March 25, 2016.
Wreckin' balls, downtown construction
Bottles breakin', jukebox buzzin'
Cardboard sign says "The Lord is Comin'"
Tick, tick, tock
Rumors turn the mills back home
Parkin' lot kids with the speakers blown
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it
Off, off, off

Sometimes I wonder how did we get here
Seems like all we ever hear is noise

Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise

24 hour television
Gets so loud that no one listens
Sex and money and politicians
Talk, talk, talk
But there really ain't no conversation
Ain't nothin' left to the imagination
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it
Stop, stop this noise

Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise

Every room, every house, every shade of noise
All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise
We can't take the noise, so we just make noise

Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise

All this noise
Can't take the noise
Can't take the noise
Can't stand the noise
Can't take the noise

10 ContributorsOut Last Night Lyrics
We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldn't do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night

Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done

Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight

Oh, We went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other
They were dancing on the tables
And howling at the moon
Pairing off together and pretty soon
There was not a sole in sight
When we went out last night

[Song 48: A Lot of Things Different]
5 ContributorsA Lot of Things Different Lyrics
I'd spend a lot more time in the pouring rain without an umbrella
Covering my head
And I'd stood up to that bully when he pushed and called me names
But I was too afraid
And I'd've gone on and saw Elvis that night he came to town
But mama said I couldn't
And I'd've went skinny dipping with Jenny Carson that time she dared me to
But I didn't

Oh, I, I'd done a lot of things different

I wish I'd've spent more time with my dad when he was alive
Now I don't have the chance
And I wish I'd've told my brother how much I loved him before he went off to war
But I just shook his hand
I wish I'd've gone to church on Sunday morning when my grandma begged me to
But I was afraid of God
And I wish I would've listened when they said, "Boy, you're gonna wish you hadn't"
But I wouldn't

Oh, I, I'd done a lot of things different

People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
Oh, but I would

There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad she could taste it
And I should have bought it, but I didn't
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it blues and greens
But I wouldn't let her, wouldn't've hurt nothing
She loved to be held and kissed and touched
But I didn't do it, not nearly enough
And if I'd've known that dance was gonna be our last dance I'd've asked that band to play
On and on, on and on

Oh, I, I'd done a lot of things different

People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
Oh, but I would
Oh, oh, I, I'd done a lot of things different
Oh, I, I'd done a lot of things
I think we'd all do a lot of things different

[Song 49: Bucket]
5 ContributorsBucket Lyrics
I ran into a buddy used to be all hypertensive
His stocks were always tankin' and his girlfriends were expensive
But he looked like a poster for a permanent vacation
I asked him what he did to change his orientation
He bought a shot and dropped this little information

I made a bucket list changed the B to an F
I gave my give a damn the finger so it got up and left
I quit worrying about people's expectations
Ordered up a six-pack of chillaxification
If you're a little depressed feel a little bit lost
Baby write it all down and then blow it all off
We're all a letter away from p-perpetual bliss
Put an F on the B of your b-b-b-b-bucket list

You know he got me thinking 'bout the way that I've been livin'
Seems like I'm always going but I don't know where I'm gettin'
I was overexistentializing my redneck
But the answer is as simple as simple can get
I just rearrange some letters In the alphabet

I made a bucket list changed the B to an F
I gave my give a damn the finger so it got up and left
I quit worrying about people's expectations
Ordered up a six-pack of chillaxification
If you're a little depressed feel a little bit lost
Baby write it all down and then blow it all off
We're all a letter away from p-perpetual bliss
Put an F on the B of your bucket list

I took my nots and added a why
I took the U out of Hugh and I added an I, I
I bet you can guess what I did next
I took my cheating, lying lover and I added an S

I made a bucket list changed the B to an F
I gave my give a damn the finger so it got up and left
I quit worrying about people's expectations
Ordered up a six-pack of chillaxification
If you're a little depressed feel a little bit lost
Baby write it all down and then blow it all off
We're all a letter away from p-perpetual bliss
Put an F on the B of your b-b-b-b-bucket list

10 ContributorsBar at the End of the World Lyrics
There's a trail of smoke coming out of a bottle
If you look real close, you can see it right there
A little tin roof bar down a path you have to follow
From a treasure map with the edges burnt
From a few too many beers

We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock

We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

In that old seashell, you can hear the ocean
You can hear the waves crash
And whisper in your ear
Little glow in the night, it's the last place open
And the house drink is a beautiful thing
Called "Make Me Disappear"

We'll throw the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock

We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

There ain't no empty glasses
They're playing Drift Away
That's where the magic happens
Back up in that little bay

We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

To the bar at the end of the world
(We'll set sail)
At the end of the world
(We'll set sail)

4 ContributorsYou Save Me Lyrics
Every now and then I get a little lost
My strings all get tangled, my wires all get crossed
Every now and then I'm right up on the edge
Dangling my toes out over the ledge
I just thank God you're here

Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
Cause when I'm a firecracker coming undone
Or when I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby you save me

It's hard loving' a man that's got a gypsy soul
I don't know how you do it, I'm not sure how you know
The perfect thing to say to save me from myself
You're the angel that believes in me like nobody else
And I thank God you do

Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
When I'm a firecracker coming undone
When I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby you save me

I know I don't tell you nearly enough
That I couldn't live one day without your love
When I'm a ship tossed around on the waves
Up on a high wire that's ready to break
When I've had just about all I can take
Baby you, baby you save me

When I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
When I'm a firecracker coming undone
When I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby you save me

Drove from Knoxville to Myrtle Beach
Seven buddies and an old RV
Beer cooler and no AC
Just to say we did
That night, we climbed up Chimney Rock
Knowin' it was a real long drop
Three, two, one, we jumped off
Just to say we did

Never had no rhyme or reason why
It just seemed like the thing to do at the time

Just to say we did
Just to feel alive
To take a leap of faith
To feel that kind of high
Tonight, let's turn it up, fall in love wild
And catch enough buzz to just ride them
Crazy horses runnin' through our heads
Just to say we did

She said, "I've never seen the Vegas lights
Spun the wheel or rolled the dice"
We doubled down on a crazy night
Just to say we did

We didn't have no rhyme or reason why
It just seemed like the thing to do at the time

Just to say we did
Just to feel alive
To take a leap of faith
To feel that kind of high
Tonight, let's turn it up, fall in love wild
And catch enough buzz to just ride them
Crazy horses runnin' through our heads
Just to say we did
Just to say we did

So let's raise our hands up to the sky
Stay on this roller coaster ride

Just to say we did
Just to feel alive
Let's take a leap of faith
To feel that kind of high
Tonight, let's turn it up, fall in love wild
And catch enough buzz to just ride them
Crazy horses runnin' through our heads
Just to say we did

[Song 54: Big Star]
8 ContributorsBig Star Lyrics
She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there that she'd be discovered someday

So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh, she melted them
As she brought them to their feet

She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where she sang karaoke every night
She said, "If you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight"
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends the groupies were crawling all over the place

And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small-time town was hers

She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where she sang karaoke every night
She said, "If you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight"
She was a big star

She doesn't care anymore that her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they are
And where she is now

Her old neighbors swear they're certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're going 'less you got something they ain't got

So she sings tonight
To twenty-thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
"Man, that could be us"

She's a big star as she eats caviar just before she performs every night
She says, "If you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight"
She's a big star
She's a big star

[Song 55: The Woman With You]
3 ContributorsThe Woman With You Lyrics
She hit the door 6:55 sack full of groceries split down the side
Can goods scattered all the way to the curb
Look on her face saying don't say a word
So, it's me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing
Western sky all turning red
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said

Been gophering, chauffeuring, company chairman
Coffee maker, Copy repairman
Anymore there ain't nothing I swear man that I don't do
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels
Just when it feels like i can't make it through
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you

She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize me
I was gonna run the bank
I was gonna run the math
Now all I want to run is a bubble bath
Back then you know I had this plan
Before all of this reality set in
Here comes life boy ready or not
Hey I wanted it all and that's what I got

Because I'm gophering, chauffeuring, company chairman
Coffee maker, Copy repairman
Anymore there isn’t nothing I swear man that
I don't do
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels
Just when it feels like I can't make it through
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you

She said I'm gophering, chauffeuring, company chairman
Coffee maker, Copy repairman
Anymore there isn’t nothing I swear man that I don't do
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels
Just when it feels like I can't make it through
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman the woman with you

La, la, la, la, la, la

The woman with you

[Song 56: Rich and Miserable]
5 ContributorsRich and Miserable Lyrics
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Green grass, hope the cows graze
Hedge fund, 401
Cake, milk and honey in the land of the free

New York Times, Farmers Almanac
Too busy to call our momma
Back porch ain't what it used to be
We don't know what we want, but we want it
And we want it, all right now

We're too young until we're too old
We're all lost on the yellow brick road
We climb the ladder but the ladder just grows
We're born, we work, we die, it's spiritual
Enough is never enough
American dream never wakes up
Too much is never too much
We won't be happy 'til we're rich and miserable
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(We won't be happy 'til we're rich and miserable)

Go to school to get a job
Don't make enough to pay it off
And on and on it goes
Right wing blue jean, gotta get the new thing
Whatever it takes to make the world look at you thing

We're too young until we're too old
We're all lost on the yellow brick road
We climb the ladder but the ladder just grows
We're born, we work, we die, it's spiritual
Enough is never enough
American dream never wakes up
Too much is never too much
We won't be happy 'til we're rich and miserable
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

And maybe we'll get it (And maybe we'll get it)
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
And maybe we won't (Maybe we won't)
But even when we get it (But even when we get it)
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Really we don't

We're too young until we're too old
We're all lost on the yellow brick road
We climb the ladder but the ladder just grows
We're born, we work, we die, it's spiritual
Enough is never enough
American dream never wakes up
Too much is never too much
We won't be happy 'til we're rich and miserable
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Come on, get rich and miserable
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Come on, get rich and miserable

[Song 57: That’s Why I’m Here]
3 ContributorsThat’s Why I’m Here Lyrics
Well I ain't had nothin' to drink
I knew that's probably what you'd think
If I'd drop by this time of night
Remember way back when
I promised you I'd drop in
At one of those meetings down at the "Y"

They started talking' about steps you take
Mistakes you make the hearts you break
And the price you pay, I almost walked away
You could hear a pin drop
When this old man stood up
And said, "I'm gonna say it again
Like I do every week
For those who don't know me"

It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The Devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

This old boy stood up in the aisle
Said he'd been living' a life of denial
Then he cried, as he talked about wasted years
I couldn't believe what I heard
It was my life word for word
And all of the sudden, it was clear

It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The Devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

I know for us it may be too late
But it would mean the world to me
If you were there when I stand to say

It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The Devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

OOH, I've been there
That's why I'm here

[Song 58: Keg In The Closet]
7 ContributorsKeg In The Closet Lyrics
We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on the top of the car
He drank beer out of the mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed
A white frame house, a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown but we tried our best anyway
We went to class just to pass the time, back in eighty nine

We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

This old guitar taught me how to score, right there on the Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more about wanting what you can't have
Sweatshirts and flag football, spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all, we never dreamed it wouldn't last
We went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine

We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

We all kind of went our separate ways, but I swear it seems like yesterday

We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

[Song 59: Gulf Moon]
8 ContributorsGulf Moon Lyrics
A corner dive down on the square
Where the windows hang with a neon flare
Regulars shoot horse and pool
While the barmaid wishes the place half full
She works the jar with a discount flirt
A faded Houston Oilers shirt
While an old crow sings down on the stage
Thumbin' the chords on a crinkled page
He plays his Zevon tune
Beneath the gulf moon

Take a walk down along the wall
You'll go right on past the carnival
Hand in hand with the keeper kind
The kind that ties to the ties that bind
Don't care for the carnie man
Or the fortune teller that reads your hand
They just beeline for a bungalow
Where the curtains flutter and candles glow
In the heart of June
Beneath the gulf moon

And here I'm on a midnight porch
Lookin' up at a butane torch
That hangs behind a black expanse
Where stars flicker and planets dance
And it's probably time I pack it in
With a glass half-full of Jameson
Well, I was born to croon
I might as well, 'neath the gulf moon


Down by the jetty, near the Balinese Pier
The curmudgeons drink the yellow belly beer
And they bitch about the price of gas
And the fish that they can't seem to catch
They blame it on the islands way down south
From the bayou marsh and the delta mouth
Where choppers roll, and the tankers come
In a midnight daze for the oil drum
They can't leave too soon
'Neath the gulf moon

[Song 60: The Tin Man]
3 ContributorsThe Tin Man Lyrics
Saw a man in the movies that didn't have a heart
How I wish I could give him mine
Then I wouldn't have to feel it breaking all apart
And this emptiness inside would suit me fine

It's times like these
I wish I were a tin man
You could hurt me all you wanted
And I'd never even know
I'd give anything just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart and I wouldn't need a soul

I couldn't see your leaving coming
You took me by surprise
Even now it still seems like a dream
But I know I can't be dreaming
Because as I lay down each night
The pain so great that it won't let me sleep

It's times like these
I wish I were a tin man
You could hurt me all you wanted
And I'd never even know
I'd give anything just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart and I wouldn't need a soul
Well I'd give anything just to be the tin man
And I wouldn't have a heart and I wouldn't miss you so

There's so many things
I didn't say
And even though
It may be too late
I want you to know
I still love you so
Every car I meet
Looks like your car
Every movie I see
You play the leading part
You're on my mind
Can't leave you behind

When I close my eyes
You're all I see
In the dark of night
You're in my dreams
Throughout the day
You're easy to find
You're always there
When I close my eyes

In my mind I know
You're far away
But here in my heart
Nothing has changed
I'm still holding' you
Like I used to
On a busy street
In a crowded room
Wherever I go
It's just me and you
Together again
Girl it never ends

When I close my eyes
You're all I see
In the dark of night
You're in my dreams
Throughout the day
You're easy to find
You're always there
When I close my eyes

You're always there
When I close my eyes

5 ContributorsDon’t Happen Twice Lyrics
I haven't seen you in forever
Oh you haven't changed a bit
You didn't think that I would remember
How could I forget

We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 AM I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice

To this day I still taste that first kiss
How I prayed it wouldn't end
In a way, seeing you like this
I guess it never really did

We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 AM I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice

One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 AM I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something, baby that's something
Oh that's something
That just don't happen twice

Oh yeah
We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
Yeah we fell in love

Well they say the sea is rising, well that's alright with me
'Cause there ain't no other place than on the sea I'd rather be
And that second comet's coming, it's right around the bend
And some day could be any day, this world is gonna end
But that's alright, and that's okay
There ain't nothin we can do about the whole thing anyway

It's a hang on kinda ride, we're spinning through space and time
Rocking this big old rock just tryna have some fun
So let's drink another beer, here's to another year
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun

We're all swimming in a fish bowl, just floating through the sky
Pulled along by gravity and nobody knows why
So it's a Cosmic Hallelujah, that we're sitting here right now
And Becky's at the bar buying us all another round
And that's okay, yeah that's alright
I ain't gonna over think or overanalyze tonight

It's a hang on kinda ride, we're spinning through space and time
Rocking this big old rock just tryna have some fun
So let's drink another beer, here's to another year
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun

We're just hands up, roller coaster, flying with no breaks
We're just speck up, salt rolling down a tidal wave
We're just Babe Ruth, baseball hit over the wall
We're just a drop of, rain over a waterfall

It's a hang on kinda ride, we're spinning through space and time
Rocking this big old rock just tryna have some fun
So let's drink another beer, here's to another year
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun
Let's take another crazy trip around the sun

I can't say that you don't hurt me anymore
I haven't changed enough to make me think I'm what you're looking for
And I can't be the fix for what you're going through
Maybe I'm not the same me, but you're still the same you

So you don't get to know what I do with my time
You don't get to say you ain't doing alright
You don't get to come around saying that you want me now
You don't get to show up with that look in your eyes
You don't get to think that you can take it all back
You don't get to miss what you said we never had
I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn
After all you put me through, no, you don't get to
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't get to

Did you come back 'cause I didn't break enough?
Did you hear that I was happy? You just had to mess it up
Or is it just some phase you're always going through?
To want what you can't have and leave it when you do

So you don't get to know what I do with my time
You don't get to say you ain't doing alright
You don't get to come around saying that you want me now
You don't get to show up with that look in your eyes
You don't get to think that you can take it all back
You don't get to miss what you said we never had
I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn
After all you put me through, no, you don't get to
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't get to

You don't get to kiss me and make it all better
You don't get to lay it all out in a letter
Blame it on something, break me like it's nothing
Just to love me back together
And you don't get to show up with your hair hanging down
Move a little closer like you're moving right now
I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn
After all you put me through, no, you don't get to
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't get to

You don't get to

With a little more, I'll still have this job tomorrow
Weatherman says, wet weekend, well he just might be right
But rain or shine, you'll be mine tonight

That's all I need to know
In a world where most things come and go
I'll always have you to hold
And that's all I need to know

Heaven knows, I ain't even close to bein' God's gift to women
But in your arms, I feel like I am
I don't know it all, I sure can't solve the problems of the human race
But I know how to bring a smile to your face

That's all I need to know
In a world where most things come and go
I'll always have you to hold
And that's all I need to know

Darlin', say it one more time
You will forever be mine

That's all I need to know
In a world where most things come and go
I'll always have you to hold
And that's all I need to know
I'll always have you to hold

There's a driftwood sign at the end of the bar
With an "X" on a map that says, "Here's where you are"
With bright colored arrows with miles and degrees
That point to wherever home used to be

We come and we go like the tide
And we've all got our own reasons why

We're all here, 'cause where else would we go
When the world tips sideways, it's just where we roll
Where that crazy train ran out of track
Where we all jumped off and never looked back
On a buzz, on a binge, on a dare
On a whim, on a wing, on a prayer
Yeah, maybe we're all here, 'cause we ain't all there
Naw, we ain't all there

At the end of our ropes or the end of the line
Got a few loose screws, got a couple too tight
We're anchors and sails, we're tattoos and scars
We've all drifted out just a little too far

We were born bein' misunderstood
So we got here as fast as we could

We're all here, 'cause where else would we go
When the world tips sideways, it's just where we roll
Where that crazy train ran out of track
Where we all jumped off and never looked back
On a buzz, on a binge, on a dare
On a whim, on a wing, on a prayer
Yeah, maybe we're all here, 'cause we ain't all there

We ain't closin' down anytime soon
If you wanna come howl at the moon
We can always make a little more room

'Cause we're all here, where else would we go
When the world tips sideways, it's just where we roll
Where that crazy train ran out of track
Where we all jumped off and never looked back
On a buzz, on a binge, on a dare
On a whim, on a wing, on a prayer
Yeah, maybe we're all here, 'cause we ain't all there
Naw, we ain't all there

Stuck here at a Holiday Inn near Austin, Texas
Seen all the road that I want to see
God I hate the snow, they even cancelled the show
Makes me long for where I really want to be

Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke
Sipping on some Foxy's Firewater rum
Or kickin' back with Ivan
With all my friends down in the islands
Wouldn't take much for me to up and run
To another life somewhere in the sun

Got cold fajitas and only one channel on the TV
Andy and Barney on Nick at Nite
Seen an ad for Mexico, God I really want to go
Anywhere out of mind and out of sight

Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke
Sipping on some Foxy's Firewater rum
Or kickin' back with Ivan
With all my friends down in the islands
Wouldn't take much for me to up and run
To another life somewhere in the sun

Here's a toast to you on the coast and the sailors out at sea
Drink your ales, hoist your sails
Ride the winds and think of me, cause

Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke
Sipping on some Foxy's Firewater rum
Or kickin' back with Ivan
With all my friends down in the islands
Wouldn't take much for me to up and run
To another life somewhere in the sun

Hemingway's whiskey
Warm and smooth and mean
Even when it burns
It'll always finish clean
He didn't like it watered down
He took it straight up and neat
If it was bad enough for him
You know it's bad enough for me
Hemingway's whiskey

Ah, it's tough out there
A good muse is hard to find
Living one word to the next
One line at a time
There's more to life than whiskey
There's more to words than rhyme
Sometimes nothing works
Sometimes nothing shines
Like Hemingway's whiskey

Sail away, sail away
Three sheets to the wind
Live hard, die hard
This one's for him

Hemingway's whiskey
Warm and smooth and mean
Even when it burns
It'll always finish clean
He didn't like it watered down
He took it straight up and neat
If it was bad enough for him
You know it's bad enough for me
Hemingway's whiskey

Man, I could use a Pina Colada
Little bit of sun on my skin
A hammock, a book
Never gonna look back
Once my feet hit the sand
I've had it up to here with this rat race
Need a smile on my face

I wanna go where I can lighten up the load
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
Get this laying low off to a flying start
Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star
And be as you are

Getting stuck sure would be easy
In this palm tree paradise
Ambition fades with every wave
For the finer things in life
Maybe I'll just hang around here
Go home later next year

I wanna go where I can lighten up the load
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
Get this laying low off to a flying start
Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star
And be as you are

I wanna play my guitar in the Caribbean sun
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star
And be as you are

Raisin' the roof
(Who gets to live like we do?)

Full of jesters, and jokers, and barroom clowns
To your parkin' lot, parties full of pirates like us
And we all come together when the curtain comes up

5 ContributorsEvery Heart Lyrics
We're all lookin' for a message here
A little wisdom on a souvenir
Another bottle with an S.O.S
Throw it in the water and pray for the best
There ain't a compass or a northern star
That ever really tells us where we are
We're just a shore runnin' out of sand
And reachin' for a hand

Every heart is an island
But no one's alone
Ship wrecked in a high wind
Tryin' to find our way home
And every tear is an ocean
We're all brothers in a storm
And we're tryin' to survive it
Lookin' for dry land
Every heart is an island

Silver linin's kinda hard to find
When the world stops at the horizon line
There ain't a harbor that you'll recognize
It's hard to make a wish in an empty sky
Boardwalks are just nails and wood
They're pretty in a picture when times are good
Cars and boats are just on loan
A house is just sticks and stones

But every heart is an island
But no one's alone
Ship wrecked in a high wind
Tryin' to find our way home
And every tear is an ocean
We're all brothers in a storm
And we're tryin' to survive it
Lookin' for dry land
Every heart is an island


Every heart is an island
And no one's alone
Ship wrecked in a high wind
Tryin' to find our way home
And every tear is an ocean
We're all brothers in a storm
And we're tryin' to survive it
Lookin' for dry land
Every heart is an island
Every heart is an island

[Song 73: Key Lime Pie]
4 ContributorsKey Lime Pie Lyrics
Big straw hat, banana drink
I can't remember what it is I think
And my, my, my - my key lime pie
Ocean breeze, tire swing
Coconut fall if you shake that thing
And my, my, my - my key lime pie

Not too tart, not too sweet
My baby loves to watch me eat
Her key lime pie
Her key lime pie

Tall green tree, yellow bird
Bikini bottom and a tie-dyed shirt
And my, my, my - my key lime pie
Big white sail, red sunset
Lobster tail and don't forget
My, my, my - my key lime pie

A six string, ten shots
Of Cruzan rum, hey, I like it a lot
With my, my, my - my key lime pie
Tortola, a full moon
Shining down on a blue lagoon
And my, my, my - my key lime pie

Not too tart, not too sweet
My baby loves to watch me eat
Her key lime pie
Her key lime pie

We got Ginger and Mary Ann
Cooking up a real good tan
And my, my, my - my key lime pie

Key lime pie, key lime pie
Key lime pie, my my my
My, my, my key lime pie
Key lime pie, key lime pie
My, my, my key lime pie

[Song 74: I Lost It]
2 ContributorsI Lost It Lyrics
I had a hundred dollar ring in my hand
So weak and tired I could barely stand
From being up all night, praying she'd say yes
So with a hopeful heart I hit one knee
With a tear in her eye she looked at me
It was the moment of truth, I was scared to death
My life hung on what that tear meant
Then she smiled at me
And I lost it

No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like the curse that is the cure
Better or worse one thing's for sure
It's real love
And I don't know what I'd do
If I lost it

Well the honeymoon ended and life began
Jobs and bills losing touch with friends
And that apartment it got smaller everyday
Then one night the walls finally closed in
I came home late, She said, "Where've you been
You used to call and tell me you were on your way"
She said, "If this is how it's gonna be, then I quit"
Then she walked out the door
I lost it

No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does
It's like the curse that is the cure
Better or worse one thing's for sure
It's real love
And I don't know what I'd do
If I lost it

I picked myself up off the floor
She walked back through the door
We made love like it was the first time

No one can make me cry, make me laugh
Make me smile or drive me mad like she does
It's like the curse that is the cure
Better or worse one thing's for sure
It's real love
And I don't know what I'd do
If I lost it
Oh, if I lost it (if I lost it)
I don't wanna lose it

[Song 75: The Life]
3 ContributorsThe Life Lyrics
It was early one mornin'
Playa del Carmen
That's when I first met Jose
He had a 12 foot Schooner
A 3 foot cooler
Full of the catch of the day
And he was wrinkled from grinning
From all of the sun he had been in
He was barefoot, cerveza in hand
He said "Gracias senor", when I paid him too much for
All of the Snapper he had
Now I told him my friend it ain't nothing
In the best broken Spanish I knew
I said I make a good living
Back home where I'm from
He smiled and said Amigo me too

He said I fish and I play my guitar
I laugh at the bar with my friends
I go home to my wife
I pray every night
I can do it all over again

Somewhere over Texas
I thought of my Lexus
And all the stuff I work so hard for
And all the things that I've gathered
From climbing that ladder
Didn't make much sense anymore
They say my nest egg ain't ready to hatch yet
They keep holding my feet to the fire
They call it paying the price
So that one day in life
I'll have what I need to retire

And just fish
And play my guitar
And laugh at the bar with my friends
And go home to my wife
And pray every night
I can do it all over again

And to think that I thought for a while there that I had it made
When the truth is I'm really just dying
To live like Jose

And just fish
Play my guitar
Laugh at the bar with my friends
Go home to my wife
Pray every night
I can do it all over again

Wouldn't that be the life?
Wouldn't that be the life?

3 ContributorsWhile He Still Knows Who I Am Lyrics
I drive a Chevy 'cause he drove Chevies
Like him I'm a baseball fan
I'm goin' back to see him
While he still knows... who I am

Mama says he can't remember
Daddy thinks that he still can
I'm goin' back to see him
While he still knows... who I am

This time I'm gonna hug him
Instead of just shakin' hands
Gonna tell him that I love him
While he still knows... who I am

I only knew him as my father
I'm gonna get to know the man
I'm goin' back to see him
While he still knows... who I am

This time I'm gonna kiss him
Instead of just shakin' hands
Gonna tell him that I love him
While he still knows... who I am

I know I can't turn back time
We'll slow it down while we can
I'm goin' home to see him
While he still knows... who I am
While he still knows... who I am

[Song 77: Never Wanted Nothing More]
5 ContributorsNever Wanted Nothing More Lyrics
Couldn't wait to turn 16 and drive all the boys around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel was all I could think about
A little rust in the bed of that truck and a four speed on the floor
Five-hundred dollars it was mine, all mine and I never wanted nothing more

I took Katie down by the river with a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool trying' to play it cool hoping' she'd let me cross the line
I was praying that she couldn't tell I never been that far before
The first time's a one time feeling and I never wanted nothing more
No I never wanted nothing more..

Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

My buddies all tried to change my mind
But I told them that I'd thought it through
Katie laughed and my mama cried when they heard me say "I do"
Her little ring is a little thing, but its all I could afford
Now she's mine, all mine till the day I die, and I never wanted nothing more

Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

One Sunday I listened to the preacher and I knew he was preaching to me
I couldn't help it I walked up front and I got down on my knees
Right then and there, I swear I changed when I found the Lord
Glory Hallelujah, good God almighty I never wanted nothing more

Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

Never wanted nothing more
And I never wanted nothing more

[Song 78: What I Need To Do]
4 ContributorsWhat I Need To Do Lyrics
I keep telling myself this is the right thing to do
I was wasting her time, waiting on dreams that just weren't coming true
And this old highway seems to understand
Leading me on to somewhere that no one knows my name
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up
I'm doing all that I can to get my mind off us

What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, and on, and on

Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep
Now the sun's going down on my broken heart
Lord, I got to get back before I get too far

What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on
Yes I drive on, and on, and on

Knowing what I need to do
Girl, I'm coming home to you

Knowing what I need to do
Girl I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you
Knowing what I need to do

[Song 79: Guys Named Captain]
7 ContributorsGuys Named Captain Lyrics
Guys named Captain are always characters
Livin' by the water somewhere in the Americas
South or Central, or some Virgin Island
Barefoot and sun-kissed, always smilin'

Guys named Captain aren't haters, they're lovers
Livin' life large, but largely undercover
Dive bars and cocktails, waitresses and tall tales
Chasin' the sun, run aground or full sail like

Captain Outrageous and Captain Tony
A painter and a sailor, old Key West cronies
Floatin' on the breeze, the salt of the sea
Ornery, tattooed, and laughin'
Guys named Captain

Casanovas and entrepreneurs
Full of bravado, that's half the allure
The wink of the eye, a shadowy past
Laugh lines from blowin' smoke up your glass

Like Captain Blind, Captain Kid
Mutiny on the Bounty, loose cannons in the wind
Buccaneers with nothing to fear
He'll go down with the ship, last man standin'
Guys named Captain

Guys named Captain have sons and daughters
Flesh and blood, like my father
Captain Vick, who played the mandolin
And when they're gone, man, you miss them
Guys named Captain

Guys named Captain

[Song 80: Back Where I Come From]
4 ContributorsBack Where I Come From Lyrics
Well in the town where I was raised
The clock ticked and the cattle grazed
Time passed with amazing grace
Back where I come from

You can lie on a river bank
Paint your name on a water tank
Miscount all the beers you drank
Back where I come from

Back where I come from
Where I'll be when it's said and done
I'm proud as anyone
That's where I come from

We learned in Sunday school
Who made the sun shine through
I know who made the moonshine too
Back where I come from

Blue eyes on a Saturday night
Tan legs in the broad daylight
TV's they were black and white
Back where I come from

Back where I come from
Where I'll be when it's said and done
I'm proud as anyone
That's where I come from

Some say it's a backward place
Narrow minds on a narrow wage
But I make it a point to say
That's where I come from

Back where I come from
Where I'll be when it's said and done
I'm proud as anyone
That's where I come from

That's where I come from
I'm an old Tennessean
Well I'm proud as anyone

That's where I come from

5 ContributorsCoach Lyrics
We loved some and we fought some
We won some and we lost some
We were awful, we were awesome
Weren't we, coach

We worked hard and we were lazy
We were heroes, we were babies
Made you proud then drove you crazy
Didn't we, coach

All those mottos all those reasons all those rhymes
They stay priceless but they come right back right on time

You were a teacher, a preacher
A mother, a father
A lot less taker than giver
A keeper of secrets
And constantly making
Believers outta quitters
For all of your time
And your heart and your soul
You deserve a lot more than a toast
But here's to you, and thanks again
We'll never forget you coach

The papers loved to hate you
Wasn't worth near what they paid you
But it never seemed to phase you
Did it coach
And those fans could be fair weather
But you kept us all together
Found a way to make us better
Somehow coach

Your door was always open rain or shine
All those hats you wore will always blow my mind

You were a teacher, a preacher
A mother, a father
A lot less taker than giver
A keeper of secrets
And constantly making
Believers outta quitters
For all of your time
And your heart and your soul
You deserve a lot more than a toast
But here's to you, and thanks again
We'll never forget you coach

For all of your time
And your heart and your soul
You deserve a lot more than a toast
So here's to you, and thanks again
We'll love you and we'll hold you in
Our hearts there with
The things that matter most
We'll never forget you coach
Oh god bless you, coach
We'll never forget you coach
We'll never forget you coach

Well, the roads that we have traveled
Have kept us years apart
Remembering a moment
And how it left a mark
Two hearts wounded in passion
This world would not allow
Well, I'm here to make my peace
With the way I love you now

Oh, the way I love you now is different than it was
It's in my brokenness, it's what the healin' does
Yeah, the way I love you now is the man I wanna be
To love what I can't have, and finally come to see
I'm grateful, for thе way I love you now

There'vе been countless others
To fill my whiskey glass
With questions I can't answer
Questions I don't ask
If reconciliation is the best that we can do
And I knew how it would hurt me
I'd still fall in love with you

Oh, the way I love you now is different than it was
It's in my brokenness, it's what the healin' does
Yeah, the way I love you now is the man I wanna be
To love what I can't have, and finally come to see
I'm grateful, for the way I love you now
(Mm-hmm-mm)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

You're with me in the silence
When the night is still and dark
You're with me in the lonely
That never leaves my heart
But it's more than just a memory
Of disappointment and pain
It's the way I love you now
Only forgiveness can explain

Oh, the way I love you now is different than it was
It's in my brokenness, it's what the healin' does
Yeah, the way I love you now is the man I wanna be
To love what I can't have, and finally come to see
I'm grateful, for the way I love you now
So grateful for the way I love you now

Got nowhere to go and all night to get there
But I'm going there with you
Tonight we're running on luck
If we're gonna use it all up
There's only one thing left to do

Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone

You look way too good
And this feels way too right
It'd been way too long to start
And it's sure worth drinking to
So baby here's to you
I don't wanna waste a drop

Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone

One life, one chance
One ticket to the big dance
You and me still holding on
Right down to the last song

Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins
Kiss that lipstick and wear it thin 'til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Break every rule we ever learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone
Yeah, 'til it's gone

You're sure worth drinking to
Baby, here's to you
I don't wanna waste a drop

I'm gonna drink it all up
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone, it's gone

Right beside crystal blue water
First wave of the day
Almost got away but my sail board caught her

Funny, when you called I was thinking how good it'd be to see you again
The key's in the conch shell, come on in
Been here bout a month
Not doing much of nothing at all

Dogding man o wars
Man it's hard to get bored when you're having a ball
Make yourself at home, there's a good chance I'll be gone reeling on in
Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in

Don't bring nothing but that sunshine smile
Come on baby stay a while, stay a while

My favorite bar's in view
Work there a day or two just to cover my tab
Other than that, it ain't't cost me a dime for the time I've had
The only thing I need is some company from where have you been?

Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in
Make yourself at home, there's a good chance I'll be gone reeling on in
Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in

3 ContributorsBrandy, You’re A Fine Girl Lyrics
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda)

There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works laying whiskey down
They say "Brandy, fetch another round"
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
"Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the North of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loves
He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

The sailor said " Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth, lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)
At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

She hears him say " Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)

Yeah, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"

7 ContributorsSomeone to Fix Lyrics
I always say the first thing, not the right thing
I'm better at a last call than a phone call
I'd rather lean hard on the gas and forget about the brake
I try to laugh the truth off instead of face it
I come undone without a warning
Every time I move on, I leave damage in my wake

I'm not what you were looking for
Thought I was hello and nothing more

All you wanted was something that's real, a story to tell
A drink, maybe two, top of the shelf
A stare in a cab on the way to some band
And a curbside closing time kiss
You needed the right head to turn, the right hand to touch
A feeling to chase, a fall you could trust
Somewhere to run, someone to miss
Somehow you ended up with someone to fix
Oh, oh, oh

Did you get caught up in the moment?
Drop your guard for just a minute
How'd you get tangled all up in the careless wreck I am?
Broken hearts leave hearts broken
Loving me is so hard, I know it
Why you took me on, I'll never understand

You were looking for something that's real, a story to tell
A drink, maybe two, top of the shelf
A stare in a cab on the way to some band
A curbside closing time kiss
You needed the right head to turn, the right hand to touch
A feeling to chase, a fall you could trust
Somewhere to run, someone to miss
Somehow you ended up with someone to fix
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

All you wanted was something that's real, a story to tell
A drink, maybe two, top of the shelf
A stare in a cab on the way to some band
And a curbside closing time kiss
You needed the right head to turn, the right hand to touch
A feeling to chase, a fall you could trust
Somewhere to run, someone to miss
Somehow you ended up with someone to fix

Darling if you think back
To the heartbroken past
Before we found each other
It's so amazing, it's almost crazy
What a difference looking through the eyes of love

Life is good, the grass is green
The good Lord smiling on you and me
Going to knock on wood
Sweet sunshine everywhere I look
You love me like no one could
Life is good

People stop me on the street
Thinking I'm the old me
Talking about the bad old days
But ever since you came along
Them old blues are long gone
I break into a grin and all that I can say is

Life is good, the grass is green
The good Lord smiling on you and me
Going to knock on wood
Sweet sunshine everywhere I look
You love me like no one could
Life is good

Someday girl, this old world will try to beat you up
Let them bring it on, because every time we touch

Life is good, the grass is green
The good Lord smiling on you and me
Going to knock on wood
Sweet sunshine everywhere I look
You love me like no one could

Life is good, the grass is green
The good Lord smiling on you and me
Sweet sunshine everywhere I look
You love me like no one could

Ol' Joe's got a Boston whaler
He bought in Key Biscane
He swears since the day he's got her
She's been nothing but a pain
When the sun's at his back
And the winds in his face
It's just him and the wheel
He wouldn't take a million for the
Way it makes him feel

Boats
Vessels of freedom
Harbors of heeling
Boats

Newport is where John hung his hat
Till he lost his wife Jo
Now forty feet of sail antique
Is where Ol' John calls home
He watched his life pass before his eyes
In the middle of a hurricane
Came out alive on the other side
That's where "the other side" got its name

Boats
Vessels of freedom
Harbors of heeling
Boats

Twenty years of a landlocked job
Was all that tom could take
Sitting at his desk
All alone and depressed
Says this just can't be my fate
Went home that night and told his wife
You can tell all of your friends
It's been real but it ain't been fun
Gonna get us one of them

Boats
Vessels of freedom
Harbors of heeling
Boats

Vessels of freedom

Tennessee, Holloway rolling out this way, needs a block, Holloway looking, Holloway will run, Holloway at the 10, Holloway at the 5, Holloway dives, 
Back is Kelly, the score 22-17, the dive, touchdown, Big Orange, 

With a voice, you could hear all the way to rocky top
Play by play for thirty-one years it never stopped
We heard 20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see
Touchdown Tennessee

It is Gault pulling it down at the 6, Gault 10, 15, 20, Gault outside 25, Gault 30, Gault 40, Gault 45, 50, 45, 40, yes sir, he is doing it all ladies and gentlemen, he's running all the way to the state capitol, give him 6, Willie Gault

Quarterback rolled right, it was a long throw down field to Willie Gault
For a second no one knew if it was caught
We heard 20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see
Touchdown Tennessee

Your voice painted us a picture of all the losses and the wins
And it's so hard to imagine a game without your voice again
Saying 20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see
Touchdown Tennessee

From the 35 down to the 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, he carries the ball all the way for what, touchdown Big Orange, Phillips running through, around, over and underneath, defenders for South Carolina, takes the ball all the way home for a miraculous touchdown and that's

So thank you John what a run it's been fun for us all
All the way our hearts pounded when you called
20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see
Touchdown Tennessee

Manning sneaks, edges forward, falls down, has not, no whistle yet, Manning rolling to the right side, motions and throws down into the endzone and it is touchdown Tennessee

So thank you John

5 ContributorsTrying to Reason with Hurricane Season Lyrics
Squalls out on the Gulf Stream
Big storm's comin' soon
I passed out in my hammock
God I slept 'til way past noon
Stood up and tried to focus
I hoped I wouldn't have to look far
I knew I could use a Bloody Mary
So I stumbled next door to the bar

And now I must confess
I could use some rest
I can't run at this pace very long
Yes, it's quite insane
I think it hurts my brain
But it cleans me out and then I can go on

Somethin' about a Sunday
It's the most peculiar gray
Strollin' down the avenue
That's known as A1A
Feelin' tired then I got inspired
I knew that it wouldn't last long
So all alone I walked back home
Sat on the beach and then I made up this song

And now I must confess
I could use some rest
I can't run at this pace very long
Yes, it's quite insane
I think it hurts my brain
But it cleans me out then I can go on

Well the wind is blowin' harder now
50 knots or thereabouts
There's white caps on the ocean
And I am watchin' for water spouts
It's time to close the shutters
It's time to go inside
In a week I'll be in Old Paris
Hell that's a mighty long airplane ride

And now I must confess
I could use some rest
I can't run at this pace very long
Yes, it's quite insane
I think it hurts my brain
But it cleans me out and then I can go on
Yes, it cleans me out, then I can go on
(Yeah, it cleans me out and then I can go on)

5 ContributorsAlways Gonna Be You Lyrics
I could jump on some ole highway
Run a thousand miles or more
Unlock some hidden mystery
Behind a distant door
I could sail the seven oceans
Till I crawl upon some long forgotten shore

But it's always gonna be you
Always gonna be you I'm looking' for

I could climb a hundred mountains
Leave a hard ole world behind
Wander right across some prairie
Like a man out of his mind
I could walk and stare into the sun
Let it all just burn me deaf and blind
But it's always gonna be you
Always gonna be you I'm trying' to find

Where does a man go for redemption
Where does he take a broken heart
Shouldn't there be some small exemption
If he does all that it takes
To admit to his mistakes
Till the truth batters and breaks his world apart

I could ask for my forgiveness
From the heavens high above
Tell myself my prayers are gonna somehow be enough
And lay down in some angels bed
Convinced I've found the one I'm dreaming' of
But it's always gonna be you...
Always gonna be you that I love

Where does a man seek his salvation?
When does his mind finally go free?
Is the pain he feels the only explanation
For believing lies are true
For the stone inside his shoe
The endless ways the years keep haunting me

I could find an empty church
Get down on my knees
Tell myself the mercy
Is a matter of degrees
Then lay down in some angel's arms
Convinced I've found the one I'm dreaming' of
But it's always gonna be you
Always gonna be you that I love

Always gonna be you, that I love
That I love

[Song 92: Guitars and Tiki Bars]
5 ContributorsGuitars and Tiki Bars Lyrics
Tired of my beeper, tired of my phone
Tired of this tired ol' tie I got on
Sick of this traffic jam that I'm in
We all get sick of it all now and then
When I've had it up to here
I go down there

To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer
When enough is enough
It's guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love

I feel like a fish jerked out of the sea
Or a bird in a cage that's never seen a key
Sick of this grind and I think that I ought
To bring this grind to a grinding halt
Now I've had it up to here
Let's go down there

To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer
When enough is enough
It's guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love

Now I've had it up to here
Let's go down there

To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer
When enough is enough
It's guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love

[Song 93: I Might Get Over You]
4 ContributorsI Might Get Over You Lyrics
Well I opened my heart, and I let you in
I promised I'd never love again
And still doing what I'd said I'd do
Someday I might get over you

I wear my ring on a chain now, instead of my hand
And I deal with your memories the best I can
I've even been out on a date or two
Someday I might get over you

Oh I never thought I'd see it
But I think I see the light now
I know that what I have to do
Is get on with my life but I can't fake another day
I can't face another night, so I just take another breath
And let it go

If I could ever feel the way I felt
I'll take a chance with someone else
And if my heart takes chances too
Someday I might get over you

Oh I never thought I'd see it
But I think I see the light now
I know that what I have to do
Is get on with my life but I can't take another day
I can't face another night, so I just take another breath
And let it go

Well I opened my heart, and I let you in
I promised I'd never love again
Right now it's still something I still can't do
Someday I might get over you
Though it may not be 'til my life is through
Someday I might get over you

[Song 94: Coconut Tree]
4 ContributorsCoconut Tree Lyrics
Everybody's got a place they go
When the old battery gets running low
I'm a sucker for the sand and sea, yea
If I had my way, hey I'd always be

Way up high in a coconut tree
Laying low, just my baby and me
Sunny sky as far as I can see
High up in a coconut tree

Not too green, not too brown
I shimmy up and I shake the good ones down
Coconuts, a couple of bucks a piece
And you can do alright if you are not afraid to be

High in a coconut tree
Laying low, just my baby and me
Sunny sky as far as I can see
High in a coconut tree

Yeah, there's less stress and the world's alright
It's a different point of view
When you're looking at life

Way up high in a coconut tree
Laying low, just my baby and me
Sunny sky as far as I can see
High up in a coconut tree

High in a coconut tree
Laying low, just my baby and me
Sunny sky as far as I can see
High in a coconut tree
High in a coconut tree
Laying low, just my baby and me
Sunny sky as far as I can see
High in a coconut tree

Way up high in a coconut tree
Laying low, just my baby and me
Sunny sky as far as I can see
High up in a coconut tree

Sunny sky as far as I can see
High up in a coconut tree
Up to here with Willie
Sunny sky as far as I can see
Let's get high in a coconut tree

8 ContributorsWasted Lyrics
I said, "Man, what are you doin' here?
I saw the band just bought you a beer
I used to see your face all over
TV shows and magazine covers"
He said, "I went through a fortune just like that
Down to the shirt that I got on my back"
I said "How?" He said, "Pretty damn fast
But hey man, since you asked

"I spent it on high living, wild women
That roulette wheel that I kept spinnin'
Beachside bars, big shiny cars
Long vacations in warm locations
I was going nonstop 'til I squeezed every drop
Of that good time, top shelf sweet life that I tasted
And to tell you the truth, the rest, I just wasted"

He kinda laughed underneath those shades
He said, "Yeah, son, I had it made
I had a big boat, it made me smile
It burned money, gallons to miles
I really don't worry 'bout where it went
'Cause it's still fun thinkin' 'bout when

"I spent it on high living, wild women
That roulette wheel that I kept spinnin'
Beachside bars, big shiny cars
Long vacations in warm locations
I was going nonstop 'til I squeezed every drop
Of that good time top shelf, sweet life that I tasted
And to tell you the truth, the rest, I just wasted

"Yeah, I could have put it in the bank somewhere and saved it
No, son, you ain't never gonna hear me complainin'

"I spent it on high living, big tippin'
Limo rides and champagne sippin'
First class tickets to who knows where
It really didn't matter 'til we got there
I was going nonstop 'til I squeezed every drop
Of that good time, top shelf sweet life that I tasted
And to tell you the truth the rest, I just wasted

"I spent it on lovin' and livin'
Loved every minute
The rest, I wasted
The rest, I wasted"

[Song 96: Island Boy]
3 ContributorsIsland Boy Lyrics
He left Maine 'cause he needed a change
And he was desperate to rearrange priorities
And he thought the sea would be the best place to be
So he saved his money, sold his car
And with his eye set on a Southern star
Got the courage to follow his heart
Set out for a brand new start

He's an island boy
Now he's an island boy
Living his life where stress is the enemy
Now he's an island boy
A stone's throw from St. Croix
He's finally found his piece of serenity

Now he tends bar at the Old Mango
And he sees tourists come and go
With their pressed pants and camera case
Too much sun burned on their face
Now he watches the snow on CNN
With all of his dope-smokin' friends
Just look at the hell they must be in
Swears he won't go back again

He's an island boy
Now he's an island boy
Living his life where stress is the enemy
Now he's an island boy
A stone's throw from St. Croix
He's finally found his piece of serenity

You know the love of his life has always been Emily
She loves the man she sees
In her island boy
Now he's an island boy
Living his life where stress is the enemy
Now he's an island boy
A stone's throw from St. Croix
He's finally found his piece of serenity

Island boy
A stone's throw from St. Croix
Island boy
Island boy
Island boy

[Song 97: Island Rain]
4 ContributorsIsland Rain Lyrics
Like an island rain, that comes in out of nowhere
You might not choose to go there, but it hits you just the same
Close your eyes and see what matters, wash away worry and pain
There's holy water in an island rain

Maybe what you have ain't what you wanted
Where you are ain't where you wanna be
Maybe you feel tied down
Maybe somethin's gonna come around, to set you free

Like an island rain, that comes in out of nowhere
Might not choose to go there, but it hits you just the same
Close your eyes and see what matters, wash away worry and pain
There's holy water in an island rain

Everyday is a blessin' to be counted
Every night is a lesson to be learned
Watchin' the world go 'round
Takes a whole lot of up and down to make it turn

Like an island rain that comes in out of nowhere
You might not choose to go there, but it hits you just the same
Close your eyes and see what matters, wash away worry and pain
There's holy water in an island rain
In an island rain
In an island rain

[Song 98: Living In Fast Forward]
4 ContributorsLiving In Fast Forward Lyrics
The body's a temple, that's what we're told
I've treated this one like an old honky-tonk
Greasy cheeseburgers and cheap cigarettes
One day they'll get me if they ain't got me yet

'Cause I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

My friends all grew up, they settled down
Built nice little houses on the outskirts of town
They work in their office, drive SUVs
They pray for their babies and they worry 'bout me

'Cause I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

I'm always running
Son of a gunning
I've had a good time it's true
But the way I've been going
It's time that I toned it
Down just a notch or two
Oh yeah

Well I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow
Well I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

Yeah I need to rewind real slow
Yeah I still got some miles to go

[Song 99: Dust on the Bottle]
4 ContributorsDust on the Bottle Lyrics
Creole Williams lived down a dirt road
He made homemade wine like nobody I know
I dropped by one Friday night and said, "can you help me, Creole?
I got a little girl waiting on me, and I want to treat her right."

He said "I got what you need, son," as we sat down in the cellar
He reached through the cobwebs as he turned on the light and said

"There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time"

You were sitting in the porch swing as I pulled up the driveway
My old heart was racing as you climbed inside
You slid over real close as we drove down to the lake road
And watched the sun fade in that big red sky

I reached under the front seat and said, "Now here's something special
It's just been waiting for a night like tonight

"There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time"

You're still with me
We've made some memories
After all these years
There's one thing I've found
Some say good love
Is like a fine wine
It keeps getting better
As the days go by

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time

Don't let it fool you!

My guitar's got brand new strings
It's a big old beautiful world
It's the blue sky days you don't wanna miss
Jukebox dances and girls to kiss
Keeps us all living for nights like this
It's a big old beautiful world

It's a big old beautiful world out there
Sometimes, you just gotta let it take you where
The roller coaster ride meets the tilt-a-whirl
It's a big old beautiful world
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
It's a big old beautiful world

There's a star in the sky for every grain of sand
And I stared up at night tryin' to understand
How it all fits in the palm of God's hand
It's a big old beautiful world

It's a big old beautiful world out there
Sometimes you just gotta let it take you where
The roller coaster ride meets the tilt-a-whirl
It's a big old beautiful world

To see a full moon rise and a sunset fall
Being out here in the middle of it all
Sometimes, it feels good to feel so small
In this big old beautiful world

It's a big old beautiful world out there
Sometimes you just gotta let it take you where
The roller coaster ride meets the tilt-a-whirl
It's a big old beautiful world

2 ContributorsGuilty Pleasure Lyrics
I've been starin’ at the sunset
Wonderin' if it means what it usually means
If you ain't found the one yet
I can keep being the one between

The man of your dreams, some guy at a bar
I’m a secret you keep, yeah, I know what we are

You can call me on the weekends
When you're bored with your life and you're tired of your friends
You only want me when you're drinkin'
And you got a mistake you wanna make again
You can just text, you don't have to call
You can say that you love me, but you don't have to fall
I can be your guilty pleasure and you don't have to feel guilty at all

I don’t know your mama
And it’s probably better if we keep it that way
Won't be no breakup or drama
When you finally call me up and say

It’s been real, yeah, it's been fun
But until whatever we've been doin' is done

You can call me on the weekends
When you’re bored with your life and you're tired of your friends
You only want me when you're drinkin'
And you got a mistake you wanna make again
You can just text, you don't have to call
You can say that you love me, but you don't have to fall
I can be your guilty pleasure and you don't have to feel guilty at all

No, not at all

A little guilty pleasure never hurt nobody
A little guilty pleasure never hurt nobody, no

You don't have to call
You can say that you love me, but you don't have to fall
I can be your guilty pleasure and you don't have to feel guilty at all
No, you don't have to feel guilty at all

A little guilty pleasure never hurt nobody
A little guilty pleasure never hurt nobody, no

It's that time of day
That we all knew would come
To pay for all the rum
And pull up anchor because we're done
It's that time of day
I see a cotton candy sky
So many colors in my eyes
Proof again God's alive

This is not a goodbye
It's a "till I see you again"
What a wonderful time
We've all shared my friends
Another day at sea
Has come and gone away
So adios to Jost
Adios to Jost
Adios to Jost
It's that time of day

It's that time of day
When we bottle up the sun
Let our inhibitions run
Feeling courageous and numb
It's that time of day
When we take a leap of faith
Hand in hand as we pray
In this moment we could stay

This is not a goodbye
It's a "till I see you again"
What a wonderful time
We've all shared my friends
Another day at sea
Has come and gone away
So adios to Jost
Adios to Jost
Adios to Jost
It's that time of day

Adios to Jost
Adios to Jost
Adios to Jost
It's that time of day

I see sails in silhouette
A sailor's sky turning red
So many I love you's said
Toasts are made
It's that time of day

It's that time of day

Adios to Jost

3 ContributorsThe Road And The Radio Lyrics
Ain't nothing out here but me, the road and the radio
Looking for an exit and a song that I might know
Counting down the memories and adding up the miles
Searching for a feeling I ain't felt in a while

Clarity and inspiration
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find
It may take some time
But in my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leaning on some friends I know
The road and the radio

Spent the night in Carolina, got up early out of bed
Bought a Red Bull and a road map and a old Stones cassette
Setting my sights south bound, no reason or rhyme
Threw up a prayer just looking, just looking for a sign

And some clarity and inspiration
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find
It may take some time
But in my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leaning on some friends I know
The road and the radio

In my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leaning on some friends I know
The road and the radio
The road and the radio
The road and the radio

Mmm-mmm-mmm

7 ContributorsTen with a Two Lyrics
Last night downtown I was drinking the booze
Like it was going out of style
My whole head got light
I lost my eyesight
I haven't been that drunk in a while
Along about 1 I spotted a queen
And I started to make my move
Aw, she was believing every line I was laying
Lord I was just too cool
Well I thought I died and gone to heaven
But lord did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But lord when I do I lose
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

Well I made up my mind
I was never gonna find
Myself in that condition again
But here I sit on the same bar stool
And just look at the shape I'm in
I done spotted me another queen
Sitting at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I can take her home
When she said yes, I thought I'd been blessed
But boy did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But lord when I do I lose
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

Now you may laugh
But if you've got the cash
I'll bet you 10 to 1 you have too

Do you lock it in the bank

Do you kick the dirt, or work a Vegas stop
Do you hit the strip, or roll a country mile
Do you wear uptight, or do keep it loose
Do you leave it in the truck
Or sneak it in in your boot

Whatever makes you feel like a rock star
Yeah, you can kick it back chilling
Or you can rock hard
You busted your ass all week

Or way up high in the cheapest seat
Hey, pretty mama, if you roll with me
There'll be diamonds in the sky and the radio screen

4 ContributorsOn the Coast of Somewhere Beautiful Lyrics
I knew I could never hold that girl
She was born to see the world
All I got is a picture she mailed me
Barefoot in the snow white sand
A bag of seashells in her hand
She finally found a paradise it seems

On the coast of somewhere beautiful
Trade winds blowing through her hair
Sunlight dancing on the water
And I wish I was there
Don't know how I'm gonna find her
All I know so far
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful
Running with my heart

Sometimes when the sun goes down
Shadows fall across this little town
And I close my eyes and I drift away
To another place in another time
When the world was ours and she was mine
I dream of holding her again someday

On the coast of somewhere beautiful
Trade winds blowing through her hair
Sunlight dancing on the water
And I wish I was there
Don't know how I'm gonna find her
All I know so far
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful
Running with my heart

Don't know how I'm gonna find her
All I know so far
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful
Running with my heart, oh
She's running with my heart
On the coast of somewhere beautiful

2 ContributorsStreets Lyrics
There's two lost souls finding love in Times Square
There's a rumble of a train running down a track
Lights are turning on the great wide wave
Cold beer here, pinstripes aren't bad
Piano man's holding court at the garden
All the street corner preachers are back

Faith believes what it can't see
And who we are, and who we're gonna be
Angels ring a cathedral bell
And on the streets of New York all is well

The eastern sun is rising over Sunset
Tourists taking selfies at the Hollywood sign
Watching up the boards down in Venice
At Nicky's house they're all gathering in line, give it time

'Cause faith believes what it can't see
And who we are, and who we're gonna be
City of Angels rising through the ashes of hell
And on the streets of L.A. all is well

There's a pickup rolling through the Heartland
And the shotgun seat rides her daddy's old six-string
Tonight she'll be singing in a bar on Broadway
She'll play some Willy, and everybody sings

Faith believes what it can't see
And who we are, and who we're gonna be
Music cities got some tales to tell
And on the streets of Nashville all is well

Faith believes what it can't see
And who we are, and who we're gonna be
Our Lady in the harbor shining like a citadel
And on the streets of America all is well
And on the streets of America all is well

Jenny had the devil in her smile and a cross on her neck
First girl I ever saw smoke a cigarette
Becky had that backseat fever on those parking lot nights
Didn't know what we were doing, but I think we did it right

And I wonder
Whatever happened to the heartbreakers
To the dream chasers
To the renegades running this town?
Whatever happened to the born to runners
To the "Let me get your number"?
Did they ever settle down?
Did they grow up and get old?
Do they have someone to hold?
I'll bet they're still beautiful
Whatever, whatever happened to the Saturday nights
Under the carnival lights?
Knew how to kiss you goodbye
Whatever, whatever happened to the heartbreakers?

Summer worked at a bar, had the boardwalk on a string
She was hotter than a cherry bomb, living up to her name
We'd get drunk on the beach, catching lightning in a bottle
Wasn't thinking about much, wasn't worried about tomorrow

And I wonder
Whatever happened to the heartbreakers
To the dream chasers
To the renegades running this town?
Whatever happened to the born to runners
To the "Let me get your number"?
Did they ever settle down?
Did they grow up and get old?
Do they have someone to hold?
I'll bet they're still beautiful
Whatever, whatever happened to the Saturday nights
Under the carnival lights?
Knew how to kiss you goodbye
Whatever, whatever happened to the heartbreakers?

You were lucky just to know 'em
If you got lucky, you got broken
You were never gonna hold 'em
Never gonna hold 'em

Whatever happened to the heartbreakers
To the dream chasers
To the renegades running this town?
Whatever happened to the born to runners
To the "Let me get your number"?
Did they ever settle down?
Did they grow up and get old?
Do they have someone to hold?
I'll bet they're still beautiful
Whatever, whatever happened to the Saturday nights
Under the carnival lights?

Tank top, love handles
Tube socks, Jesus sandals
Cheap blender, ice bucket
Raw oysters, yeah, give me one and shuck it

Holds up a frozen orange daiquiri and laughs
Here's to the boys at the factory

No more building transmissions
He's going deep sea fishing
Catch a marlin, catch a tan, catch a local cover band
Hey, you gotta watch that man
He'll go coastal on you

Silver hair, silver Buick
Winter's coming, better move it
Southbound 'fore they get snowed under
Call the kids, tell them "See you next summer!"

No more freezing their tails off
It's cataract sunglasses and a round of golf
Red skin, green plaid, margarita, dog track
Before you know it, Mom and Dad
They'll go coastal on you

Sounds so good, got me thinking
What do y'all say after I'm done singing
We just take a little getaway, cruise it down the A1A?
Flora-bama to the Keys, better keep your eye on me
I'll go coastal on you

I'll go coastal on you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, I'll go coastal on you

[Song 111: French Kissing Life]
2 ContributorsFrench Kissing Life Lyrics
Don't really know what day it is
Been rocking nine days in a row
All I know is it's hurricane season
And any minute she's gonna blow

I need a shave and I need some rest
I know some people are worried about me
But I'm french kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea

Went through customs and immigration
Still this feels like home
I'm floating 'round through Gorda Sound
With a cooler and a bong

Maybe I could've been a pirate
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be
French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea

Tonight I don't need to feel famous
Out here all I feel is free

French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea
Maybe I could've been a pirate
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be
French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea

[Song 112: Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven]
10 ContributorsEverybody Wants to Go to Heaven Lyrics
Preacher told me last Sunday morning'
Son, you better start livin' right
You need to quit the women and whiskey
And carrying on all night

Don't you wanna hear him call your name
When you're standing' at the pearly gates
I told the preacher, "Yes I do"
But I hope they don't call today
I ain't ready

Everybody wants to go to heaven
Have a mansion high above the clouds
Everybody wanna go to heaven
But nobody wanna go now

Said preacher maybe you didn't see me
Throw an extra twenty in the plate
There's one for everything I did last night
And one to get me through today
Here's a ten to help you remember
Next time you got the good Lord's ear
Say I'm coming' but there ain't no hurry
I'm having' fun down here
Don't you know that

Everybody wants to go to heaven
Get their wings and fly around
Everybody wanna go to heaven
But nobody wanna go now

Someday I want to see those streets of gold in my halo
But I wouldn't mind waiting at least a hundred years or so

Everybody wanna go to heaven
It beats the other place there ain't no doubt
Everybody wanna go to heaven
But nobody wanna go now

Everybody wanna go to heaven
Hallelujah, let me hear you shout
Everybody wanna go to heaven
But nobody wanna go now

I think I speak for the crowd
Nobody wanna go now


3, 4
Everybody wants to go to heaven
Get their wings and fly around
Everybody wants go to heaven
But nobody wants go now
Everybody wants to go to heaven
Get their wings and fly around
Everybody wants go to heaven
But nobody wants go now
Yeah, man, yeah
Oh, yeah

Hey, gimmie some love man

Thank you buddy, thank you
Thank you so much
You the man

Let's go get a beer

[Song 113: Demons]
4 ContributorsDemons Lyrics
Sometimes they're in a bottle
Sometimes a pair of high-heel shoes
Some come rolled in paper
Some have six strings and only play the blues
Once you've met the devil
There ain't no way he'll let you be
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

Skeletons in closets
Ghosts underneath the bed
They hide out in pictures
And words better left unsaid
They hang around like perfume
And haunt me like an ancient melody
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

There's things that I can't leave alone
Cause they won't leave me alone
What I want ain't what I need
Still I reach for the things I crave
Then try to run away
Am I afraid of being free
Cause when I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

So roll one up and light it
Pick up my old guitar
I'm playing crossroads
Drinking whiskey from a mason jar
Heartache at my front door
Says she needs my company
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

There's things that I can't leave alone
Cause they won't leave me alone
What I want ain't what I need
Still I reach for the things I crave
Then try to run away
Am I afraid of being free
Cause when I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

Demons chasing me

[Song 114: Never Gonna Feel That Way Again]
4 ContributorsNever Gonna Feel That Way Again Lyrics
Friday night butterflies
Like clockwork they'd arrive
A little chill and an October sky
Nervous 'til the kickoff game
Four quarters win or lose
Spent Saturdays black and blue
But it was what I love to do
And it was more than just a game

It was my life and it was fun
Another season of my life is done
Another race I'm glad I got to run
Another chapter of my life, it's over
No, I'm never gonna feel like that again
Time's rushin' by me like the wind
Never be as young as I was then
No, I'm never gonna feel like that again

Practice dancing in my garage
Two left feet and a white corsage
Daddy let me borrow the Dodge
Said, "Don't bring her home on empty"
I swung by and picked up Cindy Lou
Took her to the prom for a dance or two
Then we drove down to the water blue
And that's where she kissed me

It was my life and it was fun
Another season of my life is done
Another race I'm glad I got to run
Another chapter of my life, it's over
No, I'm never gonna feel like that again
Time's rushin' by me like the wind
Never be as young as I was then
No, I'm never gonna feel like that again

I got a call one July day
Cindy Lou was in that way
I had a big decision to make, and I
Couldn't take it lightly
At first I thought of leaving town, but I
Couldn't let our families down
Now I'm out here throwing this ball around
With a boy that looks just likes me

But it's my life and it's sure fun
Another season of my life's begun
Another race I'm glad I get to run
Another chapter of my life I'm writin'
No, I'm never gonna feel like this again
Time's rushin' by me like the wind
Gotta grab each moment that I can
'Cause I'm never gonna feel like this again
No, I'm never gonna feel like this again
No, I'm never gonna feel like this again

[Song 115: When I See This Bar]
6 ContributorsWhen I See This Bar Lyrics
Well I see the souls of so many friends
And I see us all back here again
With sandy floors and ceiling fans
A Rastafarian one-man band with songs
That fills my memories like a tip jar
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar

I see tourists at Christmas time
And I taste beers with a hint of lime
I feel lonely because it's not the same
Different faces and different names
Living like pirates out among the stars
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar

Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place

And I see a kid coming into his own
And a man learning to move on
Somehow trying to find his way
A dreamer betting on blind faith
Chasing that sun and following his heart
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar

Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place

A few have moved on back to Maine
Jacksonville and Key Biscayne
Some are still living the dream
Stuck in still life it seems
No matter where they've been
Or where they are
Yeah, I see them here
When I see this bar
When I see this bar

I wonder where we go from here
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
Life isn't over but it's always near
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
I think about all the good times that we had
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
It makes me happy and it makes me sad
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
How could we be so close, now so far apart
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
That's what I feel, that's what I see
Yeah we were living like pirates and want to be stars
That's what I see when I see this bar

That's what I see when I see this bar

[Song 116: Baptism]
3 ContributorsBaptism Lyrics
The summer breeze, made ripples on the pond
Rattled through the reeds and the willow trees beyond
Daddy in his good hat, mama in her Sunday dress
Watched with pride, as I stood there in the water up to my chest
And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood
I sank my toes into that East Tennessee mud

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new born baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound
There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground
And my sins which were many, were washed away and gone
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home
But that seemed like such a small, small price to pay
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new born baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

This road is long and dusty, sometimes the soul must be cleansed
And I long to feel that water, rushing over me again

Down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new born baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord
I felt like a new born baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

5 ContributorsHappy On The Hey Now (A Song For Kristi) Lyrics
Your spirit will live here forever
The sea will echo your gypsy soul
You will always bring us together, this much I know
Oh, your smile was as big as this island
You could drown in your eyes of blue
You were a friend of a friend and someone, I'm glad I knew

I'll always see you dancing, up there on the bow
Living life in the moment, happy on the hey now
And you'll live with us as long as, memories stay alive
And you left us with so many, Kristi
You will never die, never die
You will never die, never die

I hope time can be our healer, maybe time can be a friend
Still I'm a strong believer, someday we'll see you again
Where the sun is on our faces and the wind is at our back
Sailing south to our favorite places, where the water's calm and flat

Till then we'll always see you dancing, up there on the bow
Living life in the moment, happy on the hey now
And you'll live with us as long as, memories stay alive
And you left us with so many, Kristi
You will never die, never die

Our circle of friends, we're sad that you're gone
We celebrate your life with stories and a song
Somehow you will keep us strong

I'll always see you dancing, up there on the bow
Living life in the moment, happy on the hey now
And you'll live with us as long as, memories stay alive
And you left us with so many, Kristi
You will never die, never die
You will never die, never die
Left us with so many, Kristi

1 ContributorThinkin’ Bout Lyrics
This bed I'm makin' and layin' in is gettin' old
I let you in and we heat it up then you leave it cold
I know we said that there wouldn't be any strings attached
If that's the truth, tell me why do we keep on comin' back?

I'm fallin' in just to fall apart
Might be good for me to start

Thinkin' 'bout not thinkin' 'bout you
Tryin' to make last night the last time
Instead of doin' what we always do
Oh, it ain't good we can't say, "goodbye"
Easy come, easy go ain't how it goes down
Keeps me doin' what I'm doin' right now
Thinkin' 'bout not thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout not thinkin' 'bout you

Don't know how not to just yet, just know I need to quit
Wreckin' my head like the sheets we keep lyin' in
Yeah, it's still good at all we were good at when you werе mine
Almost too good to remembеr what made us say, "goodbye"

You know it's true, I ain't alright
Might need to spare me some time

Thinkin' 'bout not thinkin' 'bout you
Try to make last night the last time
Instead of doin' what we always do
Oh, it ain't good we can't say, "goodbye"
Easy come, easy go ain't how it goes down
Keeps me doin' what I'm doin' right now
Thinkin' 'bout not thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout not thinkin' 'bout you

You're fallin' in just to fall apart
Might be good for me to start

Thinkin' 'bout not thinkin' 'bout you
Try to make last night the last time
Instead of doin' what we always do
Oh, it ain't good we can't say, "goodbye"
Easy come, easy go ain't how it goes down
Keeps me doin' what I'm doin' right now

4 ContributorsTequila Loves Me Lyrics
South of the border. American dollars
Take you a long, long way
Beach side bungalows, sand between your toes
Nobody knows your name
There's a worm at the bottom of a bottle
That's well within my reach
And the heart that you broke will soon be a joke
As soon as he and I meet

Oh forgetting’s cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting
And she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't

Madam Tequila's a fine senoriata
All my compadres concur
She won't lie, she won't leave in your hour of need
So we're raising our glasses to her
They say "valmos hecharlo el traga"
It means "drink it all down 'til you see
The bottom of the glass and it's kicking your a**"
Boys, the next round's on me

Oh forgetting’s cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting
And she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't
Oh forgetting’s cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting
And she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't
Oh forgetting’s cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting
And she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't

Oh  oh  oh

Both hands of time keep tickin'
Even if I don't wanna admit it
Can't catch that one more minute
Once it's gone
I'm like a midnight gambler
Makin' the most of the moments that matter
That good vibe standard time's the one I'm livin' on

I got one more never forget it night
One more look at the mornin' light
Long as there's a breath in me
I know there'll always be
One more dream to dream on
A sweet summertime drink to drink on
Another one love song to sing
And one morе sunset to see
This spinnin' ball keeps spinnin' around
That man in the sky keeps setting 'еm down
I ain't done yet
I got one more sunset

Pack light, nothin' heavy
Top down, always ready
Just like old William said, "To thine own self be true"
I had a late night too drunk realization
When that love train leaves the station
It ain't slowin' down and it ain't waiting around on you

I got one more never forget it night
One more look at the mornin' light
Long as there's a breath in me
I know there'll always be
One more dream to dream on
A sweet summertime drink to drink on
Another one love song to sing
And one more sunset to see
This spinnin' ball keeps spinnin' around
That man in the sky keeps setting 'em down
I ain't done yet
I got one more sunset


I got one more sunset
One more sunset
I ain't done yet
I got one more sunset to see

One more never forget it night
One more look at the mornin' light
Long as there's a breath in me
I know there'll always be
One more dream to dream on
A sweet summertime drink to drink on
Another one love song to sing
And one more sunset to see
This spinnin' ball keeps spinnin' around
That man in the sky keeps setting 'em down
I ain't done yet
I got one more sunset

(One more sunset)
This spinnin' ball keeps spinnin' around (One more sunset)
That man in the sky keeps setting 'em down
I ain't done yet
I got one more sunset

[Song 121: Some People Change]
5 ContributorsSome People Change Lyrics
His old man was a rebel yeller
Bad boy to the bone, he'd say
Can’t trust a colored feller
He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin

He was raised to think like his dad
Narrow minded, full of hate
On the road to no where fast
Til' the grace of God got in the way

Then he saw the light, and hit he’s knees
And cried and said a prayer
Rose up a brand new man
Left the old one right there

Here’s to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don’t give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change

She was born with her mother's habit
Guess you could say it's in her blood
She hates it that she’s got to have it
She fills a glass up

She'd love to kill that bottle
But all she could think about is a
A better life, a second chance
And everyone she’s letting down
She throws that bottle down

Here’s to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don’t give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change

Thank god for those who make it
Let them be the light

Some people change

Here’s to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don’t give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change

Some people change
Some people change

Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Take me to the Islands put my feet in the sand
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean
Singin Silent Night with the palm trees ablowin'

Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

Well, if you're thinkin' bout getting me a present this year
Let me put a bug in your cute little ear
How bout two tickets to a tropical shore
Where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore
Instead of turkey we'll have mahi-mahi grill
And Pina Coladas in the blender chillin'

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Take me to the Islands put my feet in the sand
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean
Singin' Silent Night with the palm trees ablowin'

Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
(its a real good plan)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

Well everybody's praying for a Christmas so white
Come to think about it, that'd be alright
As long as it's sand and not snow on the ground
And everyday our skin gets a little more brown
We'll string some lights in a coconut tree
I'll rub some oil on you, and you can rub some on me

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
I can see us baby on the beach hand in hand
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean..
Baby won't you say you and me we'll be going
Ooooo, I can almost feel my toes in the sand
(my toes in the sand)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

Don't worry baby, we'll celebrate plenty
I'll buy you some shades and a brand new bikini
We won't have to worry about the holiday rush
It'll be you and me fallin' deeper in love

Ooooo, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
(its a real good plan)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan(a real good tan)
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

[Song 123: I Can’t Go There (Acoustic Version)]
5 ContributorsI Can’t Go There (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
You know that restaurant on highway 1
With the key lime pie, that song, the sand and the sun
Where we ran in our bare feet
Built a castle on the beach
Just the wind, the rocks, the waves and you and me

I can't go there
'Cause that's just too much us
I can't go there
I still feel your touch
There's places in my heart and head
That feel as empty as our bed
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs
'Cause I can't go there

Remember San Francisco on that cable car
Our reflection in the window of that store
How we danced the night away
With the lights out on the bay
Then wound up in a blanket on the floor

I can't go there
'Cause Frisco's too much us
I can't go there
I still feel your touch
Now there's places in my heart and head
That still feel as empty as our bed
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs
'Cause I can't go there

If it was only Florida or California
Maybe I could let myself move on
But it's everywhere we've been
And everywhere I turn
I can't love again
Because I've learned

That I can't go there
It's something I can't do
I can't go there
I'll run into you
I can't go there
When the sun shines, when it rains
Christmas parties, football games
I can't go there
Winter, summer, fall or spring
I see you in everything
I can't go there
It's too much us
I can't go there

[Song 124: Don’t It]
5 ContributorsDon’t It Lyrics
13 in the thick of a cornfield
I learned to fight, keep roads tied, and not chill
Never did change, stayed strange, hopped a train
My first chance I got out of smallville
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?

My first stop was a pawn shop
Dropped a pretty penny for a cheap fender with a song in it
I had a quick right hand, and an old band
I thought good friends would make a good band
Life has it's way of provin' you wrong, don't it?

I've been right and I've been wrong
Somewhere in between for so long
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?

So there I was, a long way from nowhere
Fried mind, spare time and a blank stare
I was just numb enough not to feel a thang
After all we didn't share a set of rings
Besides, how bad could it be!
She never found out I'd never come clean
Life has it's way of leadin' you on, don't it?

I've been right and I've been wrong
Somewhere in between for so long
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?

Well now, have you ever been down the old back road?
On time borrowed
It's a trip, it's a bitch, it's an on and off light switch
Nobody follows
Everybody's got their own past
Skeletons to stash, don't look back if you do laugh
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?

2 ContributorsGrandpa Told Me So Lyrics
If you don't get in the water you're never gonna learn to swim
He said a snake is just as scared of you as you are of him
He could tell by the moon when the fish would bite
Seems there was nothing that he didn't know
And as a kid I believed 'cause Grandpa told me so

He talked Daddy into letting me have my first car
I thought I was really something 'til Becky Thompson broke my heart
That first taste of love nearly did me in
Getting over her slow
And I knew someday I would 'cause Grandpa told me so

He said life is made for you to live
The best love is the love that you give
There'll be times when you wanna hold on but you gotta let go
And I live by those words 'cause Grandpa told me so

I promised him I wouldn't cry when it was his time to leave
That's the only promise I made him I couldn't keep
He smiled from his bed and said we'll meet again
Somewhere down the road
And I believe 'cause Grandpa told me so

He said life is made for you to live
The best love is the love that you give
There'll be times when you wanna hold on but you gotta let go
And I live by those words 'cause Grandpa told me so

Yeah and I still believe
Grandpa told me so
Grandpa told me so
I still believe
Grandpa told me so
I still believe

[Song 126: Every Other Weekend]
4 ContributorsEvery Other Weekend Lyrics
Every other Friday
It's toys and clothes and backpacks
Is everybody in?
Okay, let's go see dad
Same time in the same spot
Corner of the same old parking lot
Half the hugs and kisses there are always sad
We trade a couple of words and looks and kids again
Every other weekend
Every other weekend
Very few exceptions
I pick up the love we made in both my arms
It's movies on the sofa, grilled cheese and cut the crust off
"That's not the way mom makes it, daddy," breaks my heart
I miss everything I use to have with her again
Every other weekend

But I can't tell her I love her
I can't tell him I love him
Because there's too many questions and ears in the car
So I don't tell him I miss him
I don't tell her I need her
She's (He's) over me, that's where we are
So we're as close as we may ever be again
Every other weekend

Every other Saturday
First thing in the morning
I turn the TV on to make the quiet go away
I know why, but I don't know why
We ever let this happen
Falling for forever was a big mistake
There's so much not to do and all day not to do with him
Every other weekend
Every other Sunday
I empty out my backseat
While my children hug their mother
In the parking lot
We don't touch
We don't talk much
Maybe goodbye to each other
As she drives away with every piece of heart I got
I re-convince myself we did the right thing
Every other weekend

But I can't tell her I love her
I can't tell him I love him
Because there's too many questions and ears in the car
So I don't tell him I miss him
I don't tell her I need her
She's (He's) over me, that's where we are
So we're as close as we may ever be again
Every other weekend
Yeah for fifteen minutes we're family again
God I wish that he was still with me again
Every other weekend

[Song 127: One Step Up]
5 ContributorsOne Step Up Lyrics
Woke up this morning, the house was cold
Checked the furnace, she wasn't burning
Went out and hopped in my old Ford
Hit the engine but she ain't turning
Given each other some hard lessons lately
But we ain't learning
Same sad story, that's a fact
One step up and two steps back

Bird on a wire outside my motel room
But he ain't singing
Girl in white outside a church in June
But the church bells, they ain't ringing
I'm sitting here in this bar tonight
And all I'm thinkin' is
How the same old story, same old act
One step up and two steps back

It's the same thing night all night
Who's wrong and baby, who's right?
Another fight and I slam the door on
Another battle in our dirty little war
When I look at myself I don't see
The man I wanted to be
Somewhere along the line I slipped off track
Living one step up and two steps back

There's a girl across the bar, I
Get the message she's sending
Mm, she ain't looking too married
Me, well, honey, I pretended
Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms
The music was never ending
We danced as the evening sky faded to black
Moving one step up and two steps up
(One step up and two steps back)
One step up and two steps back
(One step up and two steps back)
One step up and two steps back
(One step up and two steps back)
One step up and two steps back
Oh, baby, we're moving

One step up and two steps back
One step up and two steps back
One step up and two steps back
Mm, one step up and two steps back
(One step up and two steps back)
(One step up and two steps back)

Ooh, we're moving
One step up and two steps back
Oh, baby

When things get rocky down the line

To take control of you
I have no chains to hold you down
If you'll let me spread my wings
You'll get the best of me
Deep in your heart is where I'm bound

I will not forsake you
I will take your hand
Beside you always
I will stand

No matter what happens
This feeling will stay
Till the day that I die
You'll fill up the heart of my soul
That I'll take to the other side

And you'll be the only one
When all is said and done
I'll keep you close to me I swear
If ever you are down
No need to look around
Just close your eyes and I'll be there

I will not forsake you
I will take your hand
Beside you always
I will stand

[Song 129: This Too Shall Pass]
3 ContributorsThis Too Shall Pass Lyrics
Hopped a plane to the beach, found myself on a boat
Then the boat hit a rock, now the boat don't float
Drifted back to shore where I met a pretty girl
Aw, but sometimes love's all oyster, no pearl
It's hard to see the full in your half-empty glass
But I'm tellin' y'all, it ain't no bull
This too shall

Pass me a beer, good buddy
'Cause I'm soaked to the bone and my boots are muddy
From walkin' through the rain of life's big storm
Well, I'd shotgun it even if it was warm
How am I doin'? Hell, I thought you'd never ask
Cheers, I believe this too shall pass me a beer

Now I'm sittin' here starin' at the bar TV
Nothin' but bad news starin' back at me
Muttered to myself, "What the hell's goin' on?"
Old-timer in the corner says, "Let me tell ya, son"
"I got fifty years on ya, man, it goes by fast"
"Gotta laugh through the tears and remember, this too shall"

Pass me a beer, good buddy
'Cause I'm soaked to the bone and my boots are muddy
From walkin' through the rain of life's big storm
Well, I'd shotgun it even if it was warm
How am I doin'? Hell, I thought you'd never ask
Cheers, I believe this too shall pass me a beer

That's the way the world spins, take the good with the bad
Gotta find you a friend, don't forget, this too shall

Pass me a beer, good buddy
'Cause I'm soaked to the bone and my boots are muddy
From walkin' through the rain of life's big storm
Well, I'd shotgun it even if it was warm
How am I doin'? Hell, I thought you'd never ask
Cheers, I believe this too shall pass me a beer

How am I doin'? Hell, I thought you'd never ask
Cheers, I believe this too shall pass

[Song 130: Reality]
6 ContributorsReality Lyrics
For me it's a beach bar
Or on a boat underneath the stars
Or with my band up on a stage
For a while everything's okay
For some it's a fast car
Moonshine in a Mason jar
And everybody has their way
Somehow to escape

Reality, yeah, sometimes life
It is not all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
Because everybody needs to break free from reality (yeah yeah)

Yeah, some days it's a bitch, it's a bummer
We need a rock and roll show in the summer
To let the music take us away
Take our minds to a better place
Where we feel that sense of freedom
Leave our worries behind, we don't need them
All we need is a sunny day and an old tailgate
And we'll escape

Reality, yeah, sometimes life
It is not all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
Because everybody needs to break free from reality

Everybody raise your hands and voice tonight
Set your soul free, let's take a carpet ride
We'll leave it all behind
Oh oh

Reality, yeah, sometimes life
It is not all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
Because everybody needs to break free from reality yeah yeah

Come on everybody, break free
Come on everybody, break free

[Song 131: There’s Something Sexy About The Rain]
5 ContributorsThere’s Something Sexy About The Rain Lyrics
"There's something sexy about the rain," she said as it came pouring down
"It feels like kisses on my skin," she spread her arms and spun around
In a summer island storm, in a field of sugarcane
She taught me how and showed me why there's something sexy about the rain

And sometimes it rained all night
And everything she did was perfect and every way we were was right
We loved like there was no tomorrow, then suddenly tomorrow came
And it was raining at the airport, kept on raining on the plane

She only loved me for a season, but my heart won't ever be the same
Even now her love's the reason there's something sexy about the rain

And sometimes when it's pouring down
I feel her kisses on my skin, I spread my arms and spin around
And let that summer island storm, hit me like a hurricane
It's like she's right here whispering, "There's something sexy about the rain"

She followed me back to the city in a picture in my mind
She's still young and she's still pretty even after all this time

"There's something sexy about the rain," she said as it came pouring down
"It feels like kisses on my skin," she spread her arms and spun around
In a summer island storm, in a field, in a field of sugarcane
She taught me how and showed me why there's something sexy about the rain
She taught me how and she's still why there's something sexy about the rain

Something sexy about the rain
Feels like kisses on my skin
In a summer island storm
Something sexy

2 ContributorsFall In Love Lyrics
A little country church on a two lane road
A bride and groom coming out the door
White lace dress and a red bouquet
Just married written on a blue Chevrolet

Don't that make you want to fall in love
Don't that look like a picture of us
A match made in heaven if there ever was
Don't that make you want to fall
That just makes me want to give you my heart
Ever forever needs a place to start
Gotta be a sign from up above
Don't that make you want to fall in love

Old folks sitting in a front porch swing
Still holding' hands like they were sixteen
Fifty good years they're a lover's dream
Darling' that could be you and me

Don't that make you want to fall in love
Don't that look like a picture of us
A match made in heaven if there ever was
Don't that make you want to fall
That just makes me want to give you my heart
Ever forever needs a place to start
Gotta be a sign from up above
Don't that make you want to fall in love

4 ContributorsI Remember Lyrics
I'm sitting here alone
Thoughts of you run wild
I'm longing for your touch
Haunted by your smile
No use in trying to erase
No one could ever take your place

Well, I remember how it used to feel
Back when our love was strong and real
And I remember tears in your eyes
And I looked at you and said goodbye (I remember)
All I want right now is to forget
Every single thing that I regret
And drown out these embers but I remember

It's yesterday again
Here inside my mind
And I can't find a way
To leave your love behind
I wanna wake up to the day
Your memory won't stand in my way

Well, I remember how it used to feel
Back when our love was strong and real
And I remember tears in your eyes
I looked at you and said goodbye (I remember)
All I want right now is to forget
Every single thing that I regret
And drown out these embers but I remember

Well, I wanna wake up to the day
Your memory won't stand in my way

Well, I remember how it used to feel
Back when our love was strong and real
And I remember tears in your eyes
And I looked at you and said goodbye (I remember)
All I want right now is to forget
Every single thing that I regret
And drown out these embers but I remember, oh

And I remember, oh
Oh, I remember you, baby
Oh, all of you, my baby

[Song 134: Magic]
4 ContributorsMagic Lyrics
I believe there's magic here in these sails
In the wake of these old pirate trails
That cut through the water and the atmosphere
I believe there is magic here

It's in buried treasure under the sea
In the music that drifts out on the street
It's in the barflies drinking their beer
I believe there's magic here

This crazy rock has got a lot
Of romance and sex appeal
It's lazy days with Hemingway
And I gotta say that it captures me still

'Cause I believe there's magic in those beachside dives
Under the moon as it's changing the tides
Friends they go away, then they reappear
I believe there is magic here

This crazy rock has got a lot
Of romance and sex appeal
It's lazy days with Hemingway
And I gotta say that it captures me still

'Cause I believe there's magic in those beachside dives
Under the moon as it's changing the tides
Friends they go away, then they reappear
I believe there is magic here

Friends they go away, then they reappear
I believe there is magic
A whole lotta magic
I believe there is magic here
I believe there is magic
A whole lotta magic
I believe there is magic here

[Song 135: Soul of a Sailor]
4 ContributorsSoul of a Sailor Lyrics
He walked in with a salty sway
Looking like Blackbeard in his day
A brother in arms just like me
I was born a son of the sea
I can't be still, I can't be tied
The only time I feel alive is

When the wind fills my sail
Riding on a lifelong swell
Let my heart take me where it wants to go
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor

He slid a stool and a beer to me
Said, you know, we're both a dying breed
Here's to love lost and newfound friends
And living out life in the boat we're in
I can't be still, I can't be tied
The only time I feel alive is

When the wind fills my sail
Riding on a lifelong swell
Let my heart take me where it wants to go
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor

Let my heart take me where it wants to go
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor

4 ContributorsI Didn’t Get Here Alone Lyrics
To everyone who helped pave my way
If it weren't for you I wouldn't be here today
To all my friends, the girls, the broken hearts
All the critics, cynics and doubters
Y'all know who you are
Mom and dad, and all your prayers
And those looking down from up there

I didn't get here alone
That road's just too rough and long
I might be the one the spotlight's on
But I didn't get here alone
Yeah, I know I didn't get here alone

That old ball coach that pushed me way too hard
That preacher man said, "Trust in God" and you'll go far
And I'll never forget the songs that changed my path
Just one more reason, I'm where I'm at
Yeah, I hit walls and I wanted to quit
I picked myself up but the truth is, yeah, the truth is

I didn't get here alone
That road's just too rough and long
I might be the one the spotlight's on
But I didn't get here alone
I know I didn't get here alone

The crew, the band
Yeah and all you fans
That stood in line rain or shine
I want to thank everybody out there for the ride

'Cause I didn't get here alone
Ain't traveled one mile on my own
You're why I sing my song
You're why I sing my song
I didn't get here alone
That road's just too rough and long
I might be the one the spotlight's on
But I didn't get here alone
Yeah, I know I didn't get here alone

Drink it up, don't waste a drop
Squeeze every second out of that old clock
Kick it back man, enjoy the ride
Keep living every day like it's Saturday night

'Cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
Only so many times you get to feel like this
Light it up, burn it out, that's what life's all about
Man, you can't just take a little sip, fill your cup, drink it up
Oh, drink it up

Let it roll, let the big wheels turn
Sling a little gravel going through those curves
You and me, we've gotta soak it in
Keep it cranking like this party's gonna never end

'Cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
Only so many times you get to feel like this
Light it up, burn it out, that's what life's all about
Man, you can't just take a little sip, fill your cup, drink it up
Oh, drink it up

Get it while you can, take it to the limit
Live out every single minute while you're in it

Cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
Only so many times you get to feel like this
Light it up, burn it out, that's what life's all about
Man, you can't just take a little sip, fill your cup
Cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
Only so many times you get to feel like this
Light it up, burn it out, that's what life's all about

6 ContributorsGot a Little Crazy Lyrics
Steel drums still ringing in my head
Well I feel pain, So I'm not dead
From the looks of things, it looks like
It got a little crazy last night

Could I get your name again?
Some situation that we're in
Woke up by each others side
It got a little crazy last night

Last thing I remember
I told the bartender mix rum and whatever you have
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you so I know things can't be all that bad
But it's still a little hazy, it got a little crazy last night

Are these your shoes that I have on?
Is this your bed, is this your home?
All I know is, it's not mine
It got a little crazy last night

Last thing I remember
I told the bartender mix rum and whatever you have
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you so I know things can't be all that bad
But it's still a little hazy, it got a little crazy last night

I think I feel a fresh tattoo
What is it of, I wish I knew
It couldn't get more out of sight
It got a little crazy last night

Last thing I remember
I told the bartender mix rum and whatever you have
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you so I know things can't be all that bad
But it's still a little hazy, sounds a little shady, I think she might have paid me, it got a little crazy last night

Got a little crazy last night
Got a little crazy

7 ContributorsRock Bottom Lyrics
She was gone
Long gone this morning
She left a note
Said I'm out of here
Adios my dear and that was all she wrote
I tried to hang with the hank wasn't tough enough
Could twang the pain
But the flat was scrubbed
Had to keep on drinking

Keep on sinking down, down
Down, down, down to the good stuff

'Til I hit rock bottom, and I cranked it up
I hit that water back with a monster stack
And a kick, kick, kick drum kicking my butt
Got a Cali chick, checking out this hit
Spitting out Back In Black
I hit rock bottom
Started bouncing back
Started bouncing back

She's flying high tonight
Just across town
There's a lone hillbilly playing stardust willy
Wasn't even getting off the ground
Tried to hang with the hang but I had to stop
Got shot with the Jay Cash needle drop
Couldn't walk the line

So I just kept shining down, down
Down, down, down to the juke box

'Til I hit rock bottom, and I cranked it up
I hit that water back with a monster stack
And a kick, kick, kick drum kicking my butt
Got a Cali chick, checking out this hit
Spitting out Back In Black
I hit rock bottom
Started bouncing back
'Til I hit rock bottom, and I cranked it up
I hit that water back with a monster stack
And a kick, kick, kick drum kicking my butt
Got a Cali chick, checking out this hit
Spitting out Back In Black
I hit rock bottom
Started bouncing back
Started bouncing back

New York City, 55th and 3rd
I reached out my hand, and there you were
Led me where I thought I wouldn't go
It's more than just my hand now that, you hold

There've been lessons learned, pages turned
Even a few bridges burned
Love's become a frightening thing to do
I've been out, and I've been in
I've been scared to try again
You're worth every hurt my heart's been through
I'd go through it all again, if I had to
To get to you (55th and 3rd)

I still see us dancing' in my mind
My arms stay around you all the time
Even when we're miles and miles apart
I reach out my hand and there you are

There've been lessons learned, pages turned
Even a few bridges burned
Love's become a frightening thing to do
I've been out, and I've been in
I've been scared to try again
You're worth every hurt my heart's been through
I'd go through it all again, if I had to
To get to you (55th and 3rd)

At the corner booth, I hung on every word
You're back beneath my hands, as close as we could be
You pull me close, and dance the heart right out of me

There've been lessons learned, pages turned
Even a few bridges burned
Love's become a frightening thing to do
I've been out, and I've been in
I've been scared to try again
You're worth every hurt my heart's been through
I'd go through it all again, if I had to
To get to you (55th and 3rd)

Oh, I hung on every word
55th and 3rd
55th and 3rd

Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire ohhhh I’m on fire
Tell me now baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do oh
I can take you higher ohhhh I’m on fire

Sometimes it’s like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my skull

At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire ohhhh I’m on fire

Sometimes it’s like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my skull

At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire ohhhh I’m on fire
Ohhhh I’m on fire
Ohhhh I’m on fire

6 ContributorsThe Big Revival Lyrics
Get ready for the big revival
Get ready for the big revival

Get ready for the big revival
C'mon everybody get in the van
There's a little church on Eagle Mountain
It's called The Blood of the Blessed Lamb

If your faith ain't strong enough child, you might wind up dead
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead

Reverend Jones, he struts and dances
While the guitar plays Amazing Grace
He testifies in tongues of fire
With tears of joy runnin' down his face

He ain't sure and we ain't sure what exactly he said
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead

You won't find many hypocrites
That'll take a chance on gettin' bit
But a true believer can survive
Rattlesnakes and cyanide

When you hold that deadly viper
Keep the Holy Spirit in your mind
Do not lose your concentration
Or that serpent's bound to strike

Either way you won't forget the first time that you said
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead

Oh that's right
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead

Jesus and Elvis, painted on velvet
Hanging at the bar here every night
It's good to be back again, oh me and my old friends
'Neath the neon cross and a string of Christmas lights

Lola built this joint in sixty-seven
And her boy went off to fight on Christmas eve
In a war nobody won, she lost her only son
Now everything he loved is what you see

Jesus and Elvis, painted on velvet
Hanging at the bar here every night
It's good to be back again, oh me and my old friends
'Neath the neon cross and a string of Christmas lights

Mama told them Jesus loves a sinner
His daddy said that music saved his soul
Between the drunkards and the band
It's a fitting promise land
For the King of Kings and the king of rock and roll

Jesus and Elvis, painted on velvet
Hanging at the bar here every night
It's good to be back again, oh me and my old friends
'Neath the neon cross and a string of Christmas lights

So if you need a shot of whiskey and redemption
Where the delta meets the sea of Galilee
Get washed in the blood of the Mississippi mud
Come all you non-believers and you'll see

Jesus and Elvis, painted on velvet
Hanging at the bar here every night
It's good to be back again, oh me and my old friends
'Neath the neon cross and a string of Christmas lights

By and by, Lord, by and by

5 ContributorsWhere I Grew Up Lyrics
There's still marks on the pantry door of that little house
Where Mama used to measure us
I'm proud to say that's my home where I was raised
But that ain't where I grew up

See, I gained a little on Father Time
The summer my Granddaddy died
The first time I saw Mama cry
And man, that sure was tough
Felt like I'd put on a few years
Watching Daddy wipe her tears
In my little coat and tie standing in that cemetery mud
That's where I grew up

Senior year, a case of beer out on the riverbank
Getting a head start on twenty-one
That's the place that made me feel just like a man
But that ain't where I grew up, no

See I gained a little on Father Time
That night I crossed that center line
I bet I rolled a dozen times
Next thing I knew I was
Waking up upside-down
Praying, "God, just get me out"
Then I hit my knees beside what was left of my truck
Hey, that's where I grew up

You learn as you go
That's how you grow

See, I gained a little on Father Time
When me and her had our first big fight
I said some things, I made her cry
She packed all her stuff
The boy in me said let her go
The man in me said pull her close
It was time to find out which one I was
Standing in a doorway, holding on to love
That's where I grew up

Oh, that's where I grew up

And she loves him, oh my gosh

She hates the mowers and the maro
Like she hates to get a wash

From the turkey and the deer
She won't ever let them roam
Anywhere round here

Ruby Red, 'cause that's what ladies do
She just appeared in her first video
And it's comin' out real soon
She'll be known all over the world

They leave tomorrow
As soon as they do

And fly back too
Oh, but one of these days

Left on a light and I
Locked up the house and I
Jumped on a flight and I'm
Still by myself but I'm
Thinking more clear if I'm
Gonna be down, Gonna be down way down here

Where no one will ask 'cause nobody knows
That you're not in my life anymore
And no one can tell the salt water from my tears
No the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves
Ain't gonna wash your memory away
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here

Untied my lines and I
Slid through the sound and I
Mixed me a drink now I
Sit on the bow and I'm
Watching the sun just like you'll disappear
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here

Where no one will ask 'cause nobody knows
That you're not in my life anymore
And no one can tell the salt water from my tears
No the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves
Ain't gonna wash your memory away
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here

No the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves
Ain't gonna wash your memory away
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier
And if I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down
If I'm gonna be down, I'd rather be down way down here
Way down here

If you want me back now
I can be found
Way down here
If I'm gonna be down
If I'm gonna be down
Way down here

Are we're ever going to get it right

What my life would be like if I were back to being free
Go where I want to go, do what I want to do, wouldn't have a soul I had to answer to
When I think about leaving I think about me

You know I got a friend him and his wife just couldn't see eye to eye he had all he could
Stand one day and just packed up and said good-bye

When I think about leaving I think about him
That little apartment cross town he's living in
Got an old corvette, got a new girlfriend, but only sees his kids every other weekend
When I think about leaving oh I think about him

I never will forget her face or the day she told me about her dad, how he walked out on her
And her mom when she was just a kid

When I think about leaving oh I think about her
Only five years old and her heart filled up with hurt
With her little arms wrapped around his neck saying daddy where you going, are you coming
Back
When I think about leaving I think about her

You know the truth is, most of the time things were really great and I know we got something
Special
When I think about leaving I think about us
How we build this love we share on faith and trust, honest way we talk, tender way we touch
All those nights we spent making love
When I think about leaving oh I think about us
When I think about leaving I think again
Even though that thought crosses my mind every now and then
In my heart I know I would never leave, there's nowhere else on earth I would rather be
When I think about leaving I think again

When I think about leaving
When I think about leaving
When I think about leaving: I think again

[Song 150: Few Good Stories]
2 ContributorsFew Good Stories Lyrics
I'm gonna put a million miles on these cowboy boots
And a real big dent in my revenue
If I ain't done it all, just means I ain't done it yet
When I look back, I don't wanna have one single regret
I'm gonna

Soak up the sun, keep the wind in my sails
Try to get to Heaven while I raise a little hell
When it's all said and done, I'll know I lived it well
If I ain't got nothin' but a few good stories to tell

I'm gonna put a few scratches on this old guitar
I'm gonna sip some good whiskey, smoke a Cuban cigar
I'm gonna dance with my baby to some slow Motown
I'm gonna live it up so much, I ain't ever gon' live it down
I'm gonna

Soak up the sun, keep the wind in my sails
Try to get to Heaven while I raise a little hell
When it's all said and done, I'll know I lived it well
If I ain't got nothin' but a few good stories to tell

Yeah, gonna be a few crazy ones, might be a few hazy ones
But man, when my days are done, it'll make a good book
Till then I'll

Soak up the sun, keep the wind in my sails
Try to get to Heaven while I raise a little hell
When it's all said and done, I'll know I lived it well
If I ain't got nothin' but a few good stories to tell

Soak up the sun, wind in my sails
Try to get to Heaven, raise a little hell
Gonna be a few crazy ones
Soak up the sun, wind in my sails
Might be a few hazy ones
Try to get to Heaven
Raise a little hell
