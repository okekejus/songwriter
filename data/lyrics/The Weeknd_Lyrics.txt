Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it

Just don't blame me, too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever
And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)

Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you

'Cause you know me (Oh-oh-oh)

Yeah, ah

Tell me what you really like
Baby, I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes

I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

You just gotta let me try (Try)
To give you what you want

Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again

Without you, I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe

My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home

Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day

I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga, then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money, ah
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pullin' up in Aventadors

Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Aw, Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)

Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Je ne pleurerai pas
Je ne pleurerai pas

I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be

And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I say that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)

Happiness exists when you don't know a thing
So I hope you don't think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby I'm a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go

But it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I say that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)

Laisse tomber les filles

I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
"Listen, listen"

From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 7

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
She bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey-dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables (Ooh, ooh)
Bring the 707 out
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Bring out the glass tables (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la) (Ooh, ooh)

I fight pain and hurricanes, today, I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps

Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption, the souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture's comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be
Sacrificed for the greater good, then that's what it gotta be

Who gon' pray for me? Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me? 'Cause I'm alone, you see

But exceptions can be made, baby, ‘cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home

'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth

Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby, take your time, I'm tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said, I'm two days strong
And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'

I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long, I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones and
Probably not if my niggas round them up and
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep

This ain't nothing to relate to
And this ain't nothing to relate to
And this ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
And this ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried

'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin' (Feeling like I'm dyin')
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher (Get me higher)
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private (Oh!)
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet

And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Know I might like it)
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Know I might like it)
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Know I might)
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Ohh)
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like (I like)
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like

Don't be mad, let her get hers (Get her, get hers)
Don't be mad, let her get hers (Don't be mad; Get her, get hers)
She made her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She's tryna have fun, take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her (Get her, get her)
Your girl so bad, let me get her (Get her, get her)
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call till the fall, he can like it or not, nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me ('Gainst me)
If you ain’t complimentin' nigga, you offendin' ('Fending)
I've been out here last year wasting hella time (Hella time)
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday (Birthday)
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace (Birthplace)
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday (Thursday)
I never said that I’d be sober in the first place

And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Know I might like it)
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Know I might like)
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Know I might like)

I just passed that "Nigga fell off" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now that word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin' like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow
All of, all of, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, (I make) all of them swallow

Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase (No, no)
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money, she play no games

She lick it up just like a candy (Candy)
She wanna make 'em leave they family (Family)
She tryna live a life so fancy (Fancy)
She wanna pull up in a Bentley (Bentley)
She ain't got time for lovin' (Lovin')

Six feet under, she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, go'n and turn that ass around

She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Countin' all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no backbone
Got a couple niggas blingin' up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waitin' back home, she got it

This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
’Cause I see you’re here to stay
Should’ve known to pick my fate (Oh no)

I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

Hey there, lonely girl
Did you have to tell your friends
About  the way I got you screaming my name?
Did you have to tell the world?
Now your girls all wanna fuck
Girl you could’ve been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you could have simply kept it on the down low

I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

Baby if I knew you’d be living in my sheets
I wouldn’t have shown you any love
I would have left you in the club
You said you don’t belong
You keep saying there’s no one
And there’s no where to go
But who keeps calling on your phone?
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong

I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong

To let you in my home

I used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turned my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumpin' out the page like they pop-ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin', couldn't even breathe and
For that money, I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving

Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K. dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga
And for that money, I been fiending
Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving

Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

Twenty-mil' mansion, never lived in it
Zero-edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar, neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin' and
Goin' on tour is my vacation
Every month, another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience

So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

She climbing, straight to the top, forgetting why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down, you don't wanna die tonight

The party won’t finish, it’s a fucking celebration, oh yeah

And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky
We'll be going all night, 'til light

Got a lot you wanna show off, baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off, baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave 'cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
'Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you thirsty
Grab a cup of that XO, baby, I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl, I've been fiending

Work that back 'til I tire out
Roll that weed, bring that fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girl's friends scream that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep 'em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking reefer now
Bet a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out

Wakin' up, half-past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you shoulda seen the other guy

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well, baby, I'm just bein' honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why

In my dark time, I'll be going back to the street
Promisin' everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time

Light one up, let me bum a smoke, uh
Still comin' down, drippin' throat, uh
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby, I'm just bein' honest, uh
And I know my lies could never make you believe
Runnin' in circles, that's why

In my dark times, I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark times

In my dark times, I've still got some problems, I know
Drivin' too fast but just movin' too slow
And I've got something I've been tryin' to let go of
Pullin' me back every time

In my dark time, takin' it back to the street
Makin' those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby, this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark time, takin' it down to the street
Makin' those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time, this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times

Oh, she lost control

Now she pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
Baby got her pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said it won't be long before she falls out of love

Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this
You're gonna leave her
You have deceived her
You're just a bird
Just a bird

I tried to kiss you
But you never let me miss you
But you never let me miss you
I thought I told you
I'm not him, I'm not him
Look what you did, nobody forced your hand
And don't you fall for a nigga like me, I begged, I begged

Now you're pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor

When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye

I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed

But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might've been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay, I adapted anyway

Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up ‘til tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
She's pure

So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered

Because I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might've been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay, I adapted anyway

She might just be the one
She might just be the one (Oh, baby)
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye

I don't think you even know it
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town?
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
It's everywhere you go
And just the thought alone got you trippin'
Got you losing your mind
And I don't blame you
It's everything you know
But I own this time, this ain't new
Now I decide when we're through

I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional

What does it mean, oh
When your heart's already numb?
You're professional
Won't treat it like it's personal
No, 'cause it's just love
It always makes its way back around
It's dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
'Cause everything you've been through made you stronger
And every day, you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how it's s'posed to
Depending on somebody else's wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl, I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again, oh, yeah

I love, you love

We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...

All of those nights you were up barely holding your own
Girl, you've got it made
Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
'Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oooh, how'd you drain all the soul from your eyes?
How'd you teach, teach yourself how to smile
In a world where your dreams can't be real, no?
Every touch that you sell is a lie
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional

The wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun

I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well

I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless, too
But you taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
When nobody ever could

Ooh, girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world
And ooh, girl, I wanna embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world

And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done, yeah
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh, baby

I'm not a fool (I'm not a fool)
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool (Oh, no) I'm just lifeless, too (I'm just lifeless, too)

Ooh, girl, I know I should leave you (I know I should leave you)

Oh, no, you belong to the world, you belong to the world

Ooh, girl, I know I should leave you

There's no one inside

This world's not for us
It's not what it seems

You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream

There's no need to hide
Don't overreact
You said you've been to the sky
We'll go beyond that
You've been here before, girl
Remember these sheets
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems

You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
You'll learn to love how to dream, dream
I could teach you to dream, oooh

We'll find our love in the sky

Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever

Slowly bleeding (Bleeding)
I wish that I told you all my feelings (Feelings)

But at least you'll play this song
When I'm gone

And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah

I can't see clear
I wash my fears with whisky tears
I disappear
Don't interfere, the end is near
The crowd'll scream
I block my ears to stop the cheers
'Cause the stage took a toll
Been faded on the floor
In this penthouse prison, I'm alone

And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth (Hide the truth)
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah

Every time I hit the road, it takes a little piece of me
Kills me slowly (Slowly)
When I needed you the most, you always gave me sympathy
Now you're over me (Over me)
Now you're better on your own, it ain't a fucking mystery
You've been showing me
Now I've been burning up my home, baby
I've been burning up my home

And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you

You say my money no good in here, even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreamin' for this moment, so you have to
Baby, it's okay
I got show money, baby
I wanna show you how I blow money, baby
I wanna show you how I throw money, baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby, ooh-ah

Don't get it twisted, got some trappers in my car
What kind of caps? I got the brownest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all
Before we pop 'em all

Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached, but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good (It feels so good)

And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes, I've been good since Thursday
So you can watch my love vanish in a girl with no talent
But to make mula vanish call her friend for my friend
And her friend's name's Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent and best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B.C, my cup full of Texas
Flown on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask, "Who's next? Who's next?"

This ain't nothing (No), but it's all I need (It's all I need)
And the peak ain't reached (Ooh-ah), but the peak is all I feel (Ooh)

They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain, hmm)

When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
'Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch

They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame, ooh
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain)
So now that she's gone (Oh, no)
Embrace all that comes (Embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (Alone you've become)
They all feel the same

I should've let you leave
But I let you watch me slip away
I could've set you free
But I'm selfish
I watched you stay, oh, yeah

She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away

They all feel the same (Ooh)
Adjust to the fame (Adjust to the fame, baby)
'Cause no one will love you like her (No one could love me)
It's pointless (No one's gonna love me)
Like tears in the rain (No one can love no more)
So now that she's gone (Oh, now that she's gone, baby)
Embrace all that comes (Oh, embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (I'm not gonna show the world, oh, how alone I've become, oh)

I know your every move, so won't you please let me be?
I've been here times before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me

She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby, do what you please
I am the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes, she touchin' me so to start
She say, "There's no turnin' back," she trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no (No)

She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtains come down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star"

But I hate sleepin' alone, why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright"
Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that I ran to the phone sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
I said, "Unlock the door 'cause I forgot the key"
She said, "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me"

Dirty Diana, no (Ooh-ooh)

Macallan shots 'til it burn throats

A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruisin' on a yacht, we clear, yeah
Said you wanted your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didn't expect to fall for me once you got this dick
The city dark, city dangerous
Your girlfriend's tryna pair you with somebody more famous
But instead you ended up with someone so basic, faceless
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
My new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, swear it cures my depressin' thoughts
'Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that I'd never fall
But here we go again

Ooh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again

Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We don't know how it's gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We don't need the government involved because we like to touch
We don't need no damn religion tellin' us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, spendin' lawyer fees up
Pen and pad gon' save my ass if these feelings freeze up
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup

Ooh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again

Cooped up in that hotel room?

You still got that adrenaline from the concert
Ain't no way you're asleep
My girl told me she saw you in Dallas, said you didn't look good
That you barely finished the show
I just hope you're not back to the old you
How much longer you in Texas for?
I'm just worried, you worked so hard to be better
And now you're back, drowning in that shit
Don't let this industry break you, baby
Don't let them take you from me

Wait
I been up tourin' state
45 off a safe
At the top is my place
You and I, different wave
Always know when you're late
I could never tell you wait
Made me talk at the lake
Lavish life type of estate
Losin' time when you pace
What we can do if you'd waste
I know the sky's been in haze
You never been through this phase
Been in fire, livin' fake
Know you try, but it's late
I run the lobby, every summer
Buy her body, two-stepper stutter
Platinum 'round my wrist, bird chirp like I'm Stunna
Look around this bitch while the DJ set cut up
Flashes from the pics in my sections while I'm fucked up
Bad bitch I been waitin' to get with, hope I don't nut up
Yeah, nut up, man, this shit is trouble
I been hittin' licks, seein' splits, doin' double
No, it's no events, check my temp, watch it bubble

Don't you let me down
If you let me drown
Die in your arms again
I won't make a sound
Blood on the ground
When they take my crown
If they take my crown

What does that shit feel like anyway?

I got a confession to make
I don't rush a date
Commitment is an enemy to me
But ever since her lips touched my face
It's like a kiss was laced
I'm feein', I'm feenin', I'm feenin'
I usually like to slow down the pace
Love to tease and play
But girl I need to be direct with you
Cause in my mind your voice just replays
Like a broken tape
What you do, what you do, what you do

Gon' make a nigga buy a ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
Material girl, anything you need
And I'mma give it to you, to you
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all

Super star undercover
You're my number one fan
Give it to me right
Watch the diamond glow your hand
Get you wetter than reverb, right after the dessert
Baby you're my Dairy Queen
Watch you make my baby cream
Lady, you're the one that I want to spend my cash on
Spend my cash on my baby like
Baby, just make sure that you'll always put your man on

You gon' make a nigga buy a ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
Material girl, anything you need
And I'mma give it to you, to you
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all

Tripping over you like a crack on the floor
Can't settle with a taste

Tripping over you like a crack on the floor
Can't settle with a taste

I only want what's right in front of me

Beggin' for it desperately

And all the things you tolerated
Made you cold inside
But I can light you up again

My foot hit the faucet, water started flowing in
Couldn't scream for help, I just slowly felt the pressure hit
Moving one toe was the only form of motion left
Can't breathe for air, can't breathe
Trying to remember everything that my preacher said
Tryna right my wrongs, my rеgrets filling up my head
All the timеs I dodged death, this can't be the way it ends, no

Figure in the corner I can't quite see (Quite see)
I just know the shadow's staring at me
It gets closer, it gets closer, it gets closer now
Figure in the corner laughing at me (At me)
Water fill my lungs, vision blurry
Heartbeat slower, heartbeat slower, heartbeat slower

Voices'll tell me that I should carry on
Voices'll tell me that I should carry on
Voices'll tell me that I should carry on

I've been baptized in fear, my dear

Washing my soul within, oh

You're tuned to Dawn FM
The middle of nowhere on your dial
So sit back and unpack
You may be here a while
Now that all future plans have been postponed
And it's time to look back on the things you thought you owned
Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?
And how many grudges did you take to your grave?
When you weren't liked or followed, how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune with the song life was humming?
If pain's living on when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't let it go yet
You may not have died in the way that you must
All specters are haunted by their own lack of trust
When you're all out of time, there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering, no nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those tears on your face
When the purple rain falls, we're all bathed in its grace
Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here when you're not all there yet
But you could be there by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken heart's heavy when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air when they pull back the veil
Consider the flowers, they don't try to look right
They just open their petals and turn to the light
Are you listening real close? Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment, we don't reach for bliss
God knows life is chaos, but He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind, train your soul to align
And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo

In other words
You gotta be Heaven to see Heaven
May peace be with you

Love me (Me)
'Cause, baby, I need you (Ooh)
Say you'll love me
'Cause, baby, I need you
Woo (Ooh)

Feels like you're a part of me, yeah
And I can't lie, you still get to me
Oh no, I'm in my feelings, fuck their logic
They can never tear us 'part, we symbiotic
No matter what I tell the world, we always locked in
So I gently tilt my head like my mama always said
And drink it slow, take it slow
I don't got the tolerance like before
You pick me up when I'm low
I'm not violent to my body anymore
But I'm not scared, fuck it, overdose
No onе thought I'd make it past twenty-four
And when thе curtains call, I hope you mourn
And if you don't, I hope you enjoy the fuckin' show
Let me know, let me know, baby

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah)

Let me be
Let me be
Yeah, ski, woo (Woo)

I can't feel my face anymore
I don't wanna give you any space anymore
I don't wanna feel like I'm alone anymore
I can't live without you, I've been goin' through withdrawals

You're my favorite drug, you're my favorite drug (Ah)
Got me in my feelings, back drinkin' mud
Got me in my feelings, back drinkin' mud
Don't want the drugs, don't want the drugs anymore

Got out my feelings, inside my duffel
Come hit the dust with the devil (Oh no)
I'm sayin' a prayer for the rebels
I'm in her mouth like a real one
Ain't doin' no cappin', ain't with all that cappin', ain't nothin' like these rap niggas
I done been 'round the globe, fuckin' these hoes, still actin' like a trap nigga
Plus, a bitch brain can't be unchained, I'm like a shootin' star
Take a bump of caviar, surfin' at the baddest broad
Real diamonds shine in dark
Bad bitches, knockin' 'em off
Bad bitches, knockin' 'em off
Bad bitches, knockin' 'em off

I'm in my feelings
Hendrix
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ski
Woo

Let me be
Let me be

Like a middle-aged child star, way I'm fuckin' tweakin'
3 a.m. sunset, fryin' like a phoenix
Got a nigga nose sniffin', need a box of Kleenex
Bloated in my face 'cause the chemicals releasin'
Guess I could be healthy, but I'm tryna find a reason
Traumas in my life, I've been hesitant to heal 'em
Take another hit, or my music, they won't feel it
I just wanna die when I'm at my fuckin' peak
And drink it slow, won't drink it slow
I don't want the tolerance anymore
Wanna stay up, fuck the floor
Feel the violence creepin' up, that's for sure
And I'm ready, fuck it, overdose
I don't wanna make it past thirty-four
And when the curtains call, I hope you mourn
But if you don't, I hope you enjoy the fuckin' show
Let me know, let me know, baby

I bet he treats you like Virgin Mary
You like it dirty and I'm Dirty Harry
I thought we were some love birds, canaries, word to Larry
But I can't fuck with you
You put my love on the line and then hang up on you
That's a long kiss goodbye, I gotta tongue kiss you
And when doves cry, we ain't got enough tissue
I'm still in love with you
Where the love at?
You walk down the aisle, I can make you run back
Like, fuck that, where the love at?
And tell hubby I'll kill him, no hub cap

Hope you'll love me 'til my final day
Even if it was in vain

Especially when I always chase the high
I don't suppose tomorrow's coming (How will I know, baby?)
How do I know tomorrow's coming? (How will I know it's coming?)

Death is nothing at all, it does not count
I have only slipped away into the next room

And the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged
Whatever we were to each other, that we are still
Call me by the old, familiar name

Looking back now, I didn't know what it was supposed to be
And it's like raising kids, man
If you weren't raised, you don't know how to raise, you know?
I just did the best that I could with them because
They know fuckin' well I love them
But I didn't do the best I could
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing
I didn't
I will never forget watching my mother get put in a straightjacket
And taken out of my home when I was only seven years old
She was diagnosed with Dementia praecox and put in a mental institution
Leaving my daddy alone with me and my little brother Lloyd
I latеr had an evil stepmother who furthеr cemented the idea that I didn't need a mother
Growing up without one had long lasting influence I didn't fully understand until much later in life
It bled into my relationships with family and those I had become romantically involved with
Whenever I got too close to a woman, I would cut her off
Part of that was vindictive and partially based on fear
But it was also totally subconscious
Looking back is a bitch, isn't it?

[Song 139: Open Letter to Fans]

I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy.
Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to "spoon feed" my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who tell stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The Rolling Stone video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you. As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest (hence the pieces of her clothes coming off at every shot). The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground. Even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist.
This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. I'll never make you wait again. With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to Trilogy. Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint.
Sincerely
Abel Tesfaye XO

Well, you used up your borrowed life
And you wasted your borrowed time
Big sleep, big sleep
Well, you barely put up a fight
Ready for the forever night
Big sleep, big sleep, oh

Pray the Lord my soul to keep

Conversations with the sky
Mercy on my soul, things I should've known (Yeah)
Master of deceptive lies
Made me vulnerable, left me all alone

Every time I lost my way, I lost my faith in you
Fightin' my temptations, put my body through abuse
Devil tricks with paradise
None of it is true, fighting for your light

Hoping that it's worth all the bleeding
When I'm defeated
Give me mercy like you do and forgive me like you do
Hope that you see me, when I'm depletеd
Give me mercy likе you do and forgive me like you do

Ghost of my sins passing by
Eyes without a face, with nothing to say
Placing judgement on my crimes
Give it all away just to feel your grace

Every time I lost my way, I lost my faith in you
Fightin' my temptations, put my body through abuse
You're my only paradise, now I know it's true
Fighting for my light

Hoping that it's worth all the bleeding
When I'm defeated
Give me mercy like you do and forgive me like you do
Hope that you see me (Hope that you see me), when I'm depleted
Give me mercy like you do and forgive me like you do

Ooh, when I'm in the darkness
My heart lost its way
Sinner in the night
Seeking refuge in the day

But now I know it's worth all the bleeding
When I'm defeated (Ooh, babe)
Give me mercy (Mercy) like you do and forgive me like you do (Yeah)
Hope that you see me (Hope that you see me), when I'm depleted (Oh-oh)
Give me mercy (Mercy) like you do and forgive me like you do (Yeah)
Worth all the bleeding (Worth all the bleeding)
When I'm defeated
Give me mercy like you do (Mercy) and forgive me like you do (Yeah)
Hope that you see me, when I'm depleted
Give me mercy like you do (Mercy) and forgive me like you do (Yeah)

You tell me things you wanna try (Uh)

You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah

You said you do this all the time
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light

Shе loves to be on the еdge
Her fantasy is okay with me

Take my breath away

Had a lot of girls in my day
Wanted more from me
But there's only really one way
To start a family

I'm a virgin (Uh)
Never got close enough
Cell phone blowin' up, but I'm waiting
For the right person (Uh)
Tryna act super tough
But inside I'm a twelve-year-old boy

I see you lookin' in a strong way
But I won't give it up
Supermodels, they were all fake
'Cause I never humped

And I know you, I know you want to
But I'm man enough to say to you (Oh)

Underneath the lies and the big talk
I've been waiting for a wife
I never watched porn, never did drugs
'Cause I'm terrified

And I know you, you can't believe it's true
But I'm man enough to say to you

I'm a virgin (Uh)
Never got close enough
Cell phone blowin' up, but I'm waiting
For the right person (Uh)
You wanna hold hands then sign me up
But just know you're not gonna score

I'm a virgin (Uh)
Never got close enough
Pure as a dove, and I'm waiting
For the right person
Never once been touched
The power of God in my loins

The title, "M A N I A", appears in bold, red capital letters.

Murphy the leopard is in the center of an arena-like area. A white light is flashing to the beat of the song. Murphy glares up as saliva dribbles from his mouth.

Abel is seen riding in his McLaren P1, singing along to the song. There is a slow motion clip of Murphy running. Abel continues singing along to "Sidewalks" in his expensive vehicle. Cut to a view of a mountain in the distance.

There is ambience in the background. Abel, wearing a blue baseball cap, gets out of his P1. He walks into the nightclub. "Secrets" begins to play and Abel sings along. Everybody in the club is dancing. There is a young woman dancing seductively in the middle and Abel has his eye on her.

Under a fading blue light, Abel and the woman from the previous scene are becoming extremely close and dancing slowly and romantically with one another. A man is watching them from a distance with jealousy. The music fades and Abel is seen in the bathroom using water to make sure his hair looks perfect for his newly found woman of interest. The jealous man walks up to him from behind as he washes his face in the sink. He then lunges for Abel with his knife and blood spurts everywhere. The music stops and Murphy roars.

Abel is covered in blood. The man lays dead on the floor, still bleeding. The woman from earlier is stood above his body in an all-black outfit. She presumably saved Abel from being knifed. The scene cuts to the nightclub and Abel, who still has a trail of blood on the side of his face, is dancing with his woman and mouthing along the lyrics to the song  as it plays in the background. Cut to flashing blue lights.

Abel is singing to the track. Him and his girl are seen stood where Murphy the leopard was sat in the area from the first scene.Songs Appearing In The Visuals1. "All I Know" ft. Future (0:00-0:42)
