As around the sun, the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing, will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Could make me the past, but that, I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Did you know you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truth and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now ain't that loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Ain't that loving you?)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Always)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Always)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you

Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious?
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love, we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us, He's given life to one
But isn't she lovely? Made from love


Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely, made from love

Ladder's 'bout to fall
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
The good things in your past

When you believe in things

Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeah

Ooh, very superstitious
Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong
You don't want to save me
Sad is my song

When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeah

Very superstitious
Nothing more to say
Very superstitious
The devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
Good things in your past

That you don't understand

No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, here's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, it's something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you, yeah
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

Of my heart, of my heart
Baby, of my heart

[Song 5: I Wish]
33 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschI Wish Lyrics“I Wish” tells the story of a young boy and all the tales of his childhood and the mischief he got into throughout his childhood and up into his teenage years.
Looking back on when I was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, "Boy, thought I told you not to go outside"
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do

Brother said he's telling 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing ain't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?

[Song 6: Sir Duke]
52 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschSir Duke LyricsSide 1 of Stevie Wonder’s iconic 1976 double LP, “Songs in the Key of Life,” ends with a tribute to Duke Ellington, who passed away in 1974.
Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget, no
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all, all, all-all-all over the people
Can't you feel it all over?
Come on, let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody, all over people, go

They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places

When you get fooled by smiling faces

A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through

But don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama
'Cause I'll be standing in the wings
When you check it out
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Why has there never been a holiday
Where peace is celebrated
All throughout the world

The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out, don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can

Happy birthday to you

Ooh yeah
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday...

We know the key to unity of all people
Is in the dream that you had so long ago
That lives in all of the hearts of people
That believe in unity
We'll make the dream become a reality
I know we will
Because our hearts tell us so

Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday

Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You, too, might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I've sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You, too, might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds say improbable
What do they know?
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You, too, like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over you
Over you

Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind, felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

There's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more

We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers' tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
And I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
That knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it

Marley's hot on the box
Tonight, there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

Didn't know that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on

You ask me, am I happy?
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no, no, no, baby, baby
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Na, no, na na, na na na
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
No, no, no, baby, nobody told you, oh, oh, oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn

I bet you if someone approached you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin'
You would not believe it
Because you never thought that you'd be jammin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, oh
You may as well believe what you are feeling
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Because you feel your body jammin'
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Oh, oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, oh, whoo, whoo
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Baby, baby, baby, baby

My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the Milky Way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

La-la, la, la, la, la
La-la, la, la, la, la
La-la, la, la, la, la

Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for

Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me, I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek, it's really you, my part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

We are undercover passion on the run, yeah
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers

Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say, no special place to go
But when I ask, "Will you be coming back soon?"
You don't know, never know

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye

Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time that you are near to me, baby?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to make a dream come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes
So true, ooh, ooh
And that is why

Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, oh
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go

Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go

All the bleeding hearts
With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
And they won't go when I go

And I'll go
Where I've longed to go
So long
Away from tears

Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes
Along with him I'll bide
And they won't go when I go

Big men feeling small
Weak ones standing tall
I will watch them fall
'Cause they won't go when I go

And I'll go
Where I've longed to go
So long
Away from tears

Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
For them there is a resting place
People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He will give, he will give
He ain't hardly gonna give, oh yeah

The greed of man will be
Far away from me
And my soul will be free
And they won't go when I go

Since my soul conceived
All that I believe
The kingdom I will see
'Cause they won't go when I go

And I'll go
Where I'll go
No one can keep me from
My destiny, yeah

With pride and strength no one would test
But yet have feminine finesse
And so much more

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

A female Shakespeare of your time
With looks to blow Picasso's mind
You were the best
Your body moved with grace and song
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms
Nevertheless, oh oh

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world

Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do
Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do

The passion burning in your heart
Would make hell's fire seem like a spark
Where did it go
Just why that you would overnight
Turn love to stone as cold as ice
I'll never know

But you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Baby, you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world (Cold, too cold)

You took me riding in a rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped my Black ass
Down to this cold, cold world
...me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down into this cold, cold world
(I would not do that to a dog, baby)

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
(Rocket love)

That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart
She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescue of love that you'll leave torn apart
That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
'Cause she can please her man
She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long

Before I tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

I've been hurting for a long time
And you've been playing for a long time
You know it's true
I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do

(I’m talkin’ ‘bout that girl, that girl)
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)

That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize is that I've listened to every word

That's why I know I'll tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love now

I love her
And I want her
And my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To begin her love
I love her
I want her
My mind and soul and body needs her
Oh, tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that, oh-ohh-ohhh....
Say I love her, that I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her – that girl!

That girl, that girl!
Oh, that girl, that girl, that girl, that girl, ohhh

But through my eyes, the light of you is all I see
For you, there might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody

So long ago, my heart, without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not, though understanding
Fell in love with one who would break my heart in two

For you, love might bring a toast of wine
But with each sparkle, know the best for you, I pray
Woah, for you, love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday

So long ago, my heart, without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not, though understanding
I fell in love with one who would break my heart in two, woah, woah

I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky
I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky

She's a girl in a dream
She sees a four-eyed cartoon monster on the T.V. screen
She takes another puff, and says, "It's a crazy scene"
That red is green
And she's a tangerine

I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't left the ground
I'm too high, I'm too high
I hope I never ever come down

She's the girl in her life
But her world's a superficial paradise
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice
But, no dice
She wasn't very nice
Ow!

I'm too high, I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to die

She's a girl of the past
I guess that all got to her at last
Ah, did you hear the news about the girl today?
She passed away
What did her friends say?


They said she's too high, too high
Can't hang around her anyway...

[Song 33: Visions]
21 ContributorsVisions LyricsThis the second track off of his critically acclaimed album, “Innervisions”.

Stevie Wonder talks about an ideal society where we are not only at peace with others but also with ourselves.
People hand in hand
Have I lived to see the milk and honey land?
Where hate's a dream and love forever stands
Or is this a vision in my mind?

The law was never passed
But somehow all men feel they are truly free at last
Have we really gone this far through space and time
Or is this a vision in my mind?

I'm not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only turn to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending

But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful?
Or do we have to find our wings and fly away
To the vision in our mind?

I'm not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only change to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending

But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful?
Or do we have to take our wings and fly away
To the visions in our minds?

Here we are on earth together, it's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you

Will it stay, the love you feel for me?
Will it say that you will be by my side to see me through
Until my life is through?

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I

I am glad, at least in my life, I found someone
That may not be here forever to see me through
But I found strength in you

I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

'Cause in my mind, you will stay here always
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
In my mind we can conquer the world
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I
Oh, you and I

If it's magic
Then why can't it be everlasting?
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poet's endless rhyme
Like the galaxies in time

If it's pleasing
Then why can't it be never leaving?
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells

It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

So if it's special
Then with it, why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style?
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child

It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

So if it's magic
Why can't we make it everlasting?
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone

Oh
Oh

That is when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone

You said then you'd be the life in autumn
Said you'd be the one to see the way
No, I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find my love has gone away
Why didn't you stay?

Hey, hey, hey

I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore high top shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boo-hooed it
But I told them time and time again
"Don't you know I was made to love her
Build my world all around her"
Yeah, hey, hey, hey

She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

I was knee-high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah, hey hey, hey
Ah, I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey

Ooh baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey, ooh-wee, baby

Summer Soft
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus
She brings gifts through her breeze
Morning Rain
Gently plays her rhythms on your windowpane
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change
To bring rain or sunshine

And so you wait to see what she'll do
Is it sun or rain for you?
But it breaks your heart in two
When you find it's October

And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
Taking with her summer's play

Winter Wind
Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend
But not waiting for your answer, he begins
Forcing danger's way with his breeze
Morning snow
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
But just where or when, he never lets you know
If it's snow or clear days you'll find

And so you wait to see what he'll do
Is it sun or snow for you?
But it breaks your heart in two
'Cause you've been fooled by April

And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone
You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

All is fair in love
Love's a crazy game
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say
But all is changed with time
The future none can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery

But all is fair in love
I had to go away
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away
The losing side I'll play
But all is fair in love
I should never have left your side
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December, our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday, all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas, we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning, people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today

Someday, all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas, man will not fail
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

(Someday all our dreams will come to be)
(Someday in a world where men are free)
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmastime

Got a counterfeit dollar in his hand

Knowing all the time that his lie's a mile
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Must be seen, there's no doubt
He's the coolest one with the biggest mouth

He will say, "What do you know?
If you had my kind of cash
You'd have more than one place to go"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Any place, he will play
His only concern is how much you'll pay
He's Misstra Know-It-All
If he shakes on a bet
He's the kind of dude that won't pay his debt
Oh, He's Misstra Know-It-All

When you say that he's living wrong
He'll tell you he knows he's living right
And you'd be a stronger man
If you took Misstra Know-It-All's advice, oh oh
Ooh-ooh, mmm-mmm-mmm

He's the man with a plan
Got a counterfeit dollar in his hand
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Take my word, please beware
Of a man that just don't give a care, no

Can his mind take the pain?
Take your hat off to the man
Who's got the plan, yeah, yeah
He's Misstra Know-It-All

Everybody tip your hat, now
To the man who's got the plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Give a hand to the man
Let you know he's got the plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Give a hand to the man
That you know darn well has got the super plan

Don't you know we'd have a better land?

Although you've given out as much as you can
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Hey, you talk too much
You worry me to death, hey

Thinking of only himself

Looking in your eyes
Kind of heaven eyes
Closing both my eyes
Waiting for surprise

To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far
'Cause I'm not afraid to try and go it
To know the love and the beauty never known before
I'll leave it up to you to show it

And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away

Looking at your hands
Hands can understand
Waiting for the chance
Just to hold your hand

A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that here's a dream come true
There's no way that I'll be losing

And golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Golden lady, golden lady
I'd like to go there
Take me right away


A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that you're my dream come true
There is no way that I'll be losing

And golden lady, golden lady

Mary wants to be a superwoman
But is that really in her head?
But I just want to live each day
To love her for what she is, mmm
Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind?
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind

But, very well, I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, and I think I can be very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can cope with everything going through your head

Mary wants to be a superwoman
And try to boss the bull around
But does she really think that
She will get by with a dream?
My woman wants to be a superwoman
And I just had to say goodbye
Because I can't spend all my hours
Starting to cry

But, very well, I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well (Very well)
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, think that I know you, too, very well
Wish you knew me like I know you, very well (Very well)
But I think I can deal with everything going through your head

When the summer came, you were not around
Now the summer's gone, and love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you–last winter, my love?

When the winter came, you went further south
Parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt
Where are you when I need you–like right now?

Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past

When the winter came, you were not around
Through the bitter winds, love could not be found
Where were you when I needed you–last winter, my love?

Oh, I need you, baby, I need you, baby

Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past, oh

Spring will fill the air, you will come around
Is it summer love that will let me down?
Where were you when I needed you–last winter, my love?

We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you

But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"You haven't done nothin'!'"

It's not too cool to be ridiculed
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else, yeah

And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"You haven't done nothin'!"

Doo doo wop—hey hey hey

We would not care to wake up to the nightmare
That's becoming real life, mmm
But when misled who knows a person's mind
Can turn as cold as ice, mmm hmm

Why do you keep on making us hear your song
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong?
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"You haven't done nothin'!!!!"
Yeah, now

Would you like to go with me
Down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me
To Village Ghetto Land?
See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals from garbage cans

Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink, drunk to all demands

Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the street
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me, would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land?

[Song 46: Ordinary Pain]
22 ContributorsOrdinary Pain Lyrics
When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart
When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away, you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart
Tell her you're glad
It's over, in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back?
Takin' that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart
Your heart
In your heart
In your heart

You're just a masochistic fool
Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head
But like a playboy, you said no (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
This little girl mind, you will blow (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But then it blew you out the box (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
When I put my stuff on key and lock (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
It makes me feel kind of sick (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
To know love put you in a trick (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
I knew our love would have to end (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
The day I made it with your friend (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Giving your love to one unreal (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Like a big fool, I know you feel (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But in this lovie-dovie game (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
With all its joy, there must be pain (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But now the time has surely come (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
This game don't seem like so much fun (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You're crying big crocodile tears (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Don't match the ones I've cried for years (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
When I was home waiting for you (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You were out somewhere doing the do (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You know I'd really like to stay (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But like you did, I've got to play (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You're dumb to think I'd let you be (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Scott-free without some pain from me (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
I heard your song and took a chance (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But to your music, I can't dance (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Go tell your story, sob-sad (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
About you blowing what you had (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Since one ain't good enough for you (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Then do yourself, see how you do (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)

(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)

I've always come to the conclusion that "but" is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on one's head
So I have tried to not be the one who'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside, I think you should know

And baby, that's you, you, you
Made life's history
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start living for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming far and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring

Baby, baby, it's you, you, you
Made life's history (Oh, baby)
You've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears (Yeah)
You brought some joy inside my tears

Baby, baby, you have done what no one thought could be
Hey, you brought some joy inside my tears
Got to tell you

You brought some joy inside my tears (You brought some joy inside my tears)
Baby, baby, baby, you have done what no one thought could be (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You brought some joy inside my tears (Yeah, yeah, yeah, you made it, baby)
You, you, you made life's history (Made life's history)
You brought some joy inside my tears (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You have done what no one thought could be (Nobody ever thought it would be)
You brought some joy inside my tears

You brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears

Packing my bags, going away
To a place where the air is clean
On Saturn
There's no sense to sit and watch people die
We don't fight our wars the way you do
We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes

There's no principles in what you say
No direction in the things you do
For your world is soon to come to a close
Through the ages, all great men have taught
Truth and happiness just can't be bought or sold
Tell me, why are you people so cold?

I'm going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars, 'cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high

We have come here many times before
To find your strategy to peace is war
Killing helpless men, women, and children
That don't even know what they're dying for
We can't trust you when you take a stand
With a gun and bible in your hand
And the cold expression on your face
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy

I'm going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars, 'cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high

I'ma stop on J
Don't do that (Let her go first)
Let her go first, please let her go first (Let me go first, go 'head)
Alright, let Alwatta go by herself
Okay, then we gon' take turns
Alright
Strawberry shortcake, cream on top
Tell me the name of your sweetheart
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

19 ContributorsI Believe (When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever) Lyrics
Shattered dreams, worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well

The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever

Without despair we will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been must never end
And with the strength we have won't be erased

When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind

Mmm, I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever
Ever, ever, ever, ever
Ow!
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love (I'm so glad that I found someone)
With you it will be forever (To believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love (I'm so glad that I found someone)
With you it will be forever (To believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love (I'm so glad that I found someone)
With you it will be forever (To believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love (I'm so glad that I found someone)
With you it will be forever (To believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love (I'm so glad that I found someone)
With you it will be forever (To believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love (I'm so glad that I found someone)
With you it will be forever (To believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love (I'm so glad that I found someone)
With you it will be forever (To believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love (I'm so glad that I found someone)
With you it will be forever (To believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love (I'm so glad that I found someone)
With you it will be forever (To believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love (I'm so glad that I found someone)
With you it will be forever (To believe in again)

Come on, let's fall in love
You're the woman I've been waiting for
Come on, let's fall in love
You're the girl that I really adore
Come on, let's fall in love
(Don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna fall in love with me?)
Come on, baby, let's fall in love
Come on, let's fall in love

There are people who have let the problems of today
Lead them to conclude that for them, life is not the way
But every problem has an answer and if yours, you cannot find
You should talk it over to Him, He'll give you peace of mind

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend
Never communicating with the One who lives within
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down
And you can talk to Him anytime, He's always around

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Well, He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world
For solving the problems of all men, women, little boys and girls

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When your load's too much to bear
Just go talk to God, He cares (I know he does)
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Thank you

When was the last time
That they heard you say
Mother or father, I love you
And when was the last time
That they heard you say
Daughter or son, I love you
Ones you say you cherish every day
Can instantly be taken away
Then you'd say I know this can't be true
When you never took the time
To simply tell them "I love you"

When was the last time
That they heard you say
Sister or brother, I love you
And when was the last time
That they heard you say
Darling or best friend, I love you
The one for whom you'd give your very life
Could be taken in the twinkling of an eye
Through your tears you'd ask why did you go
Knowing you didn't always show
Just how much you loved them so

These three words
Sweet and simple
These three words
Short and kind
These three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside

I know a family
Who hasn't a cent to their name
And yet the joy and love they have between them
They always claim
And when one's called from life
The survived mourn the lost
And will never be the same
Yet they rejoice
In knowing they gave them their all

These three words
Sweet and simple
These three words
Short and kind
These three words, these three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside
These three words
Sweet and simple, oh sweet simple
These three words
These three words, these three words, these three words
Short and kind
Short and kind
These three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside

I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone Black boy crazy, I've gone white girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
I've gone white girl crazy, she's gone Black boy hazy
We're each others baby, we're in love

I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone Black boy crazy, I've gone white girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love
She can't love me, I can't love her
'Cause they say we're the wrong color
Staring, gloating, laughing, looking
Like we've done something wrong
Because we show love strong, get real, come on
Calling us names too bad to mention
But we pay them no attention
For color blind are inner feelings
If we feel happiness
And know our love's the best, forget their mess

I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone Black boy crazy, I've gone white girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever

Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight

I'm a poor man's son from across the railroad tracks
Only should I own this hair on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight, because my heart is true

She says, baby, everything is alright
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, and clean out of sight (Woo!)

She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I
I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see, I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight, because my heart is true

She says baby, everything is alright
Uptight, clean out of sight (Woo!)
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight (Woo!)

Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, hahahahaha, yeah (Woo!)
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, way out of sight (Woo!)

Moving on (Moving on), moving on (Moving on)

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor, restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Moving on (Moving on), moving on (Moving on)
Like this tired, troubled earth
I've been rolling since my birth
Moving on (Moving on), moving on (Moving on)

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor, restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

You know, when times are bad and you're feeling sad (I will find me a place in the sun)
I want you to always remember

Yes, there's a place in the sun (Place in the sun, place in the sun)
Where there's hope for everyone (Hope for everyone, hope for everyone)
Where my poor, restless heart's gotta run (Poor, restless heart, poor, restless heart, run)
I know there's a place in the sun (Place in the sun, place in the sun)
And before my life is done (Before my life is done, before my life is done)
Gotta find me a place in the sun (Find me a place, find me a place, place in the sun, place in the sun)
Woah, mmm (Place in the sun, place in the sun)
Mmm, mmm, yeah (Place in the sun, place in the sun)

[Song 59: If You Really Love Me]
14 ContributorsIf You Really Love Me Lyrics
And if you really love me
Won't you tell me, yeah?
And if you really need me
Won't you tell me, yeah?
Then I won't have to be
Playing around

You call my name, ooh, so sweet
To make your kiss incomplete
When your mood is clear
You quickly change your ways
Then you say I'm untrue
What am I supposed to do?
Be a fool who sits alone waiting for you?

But if you really love me
Won't you tell me, yeah?
And if you really need me
Won't you tell me, yeah?
Then I won't have to be
Playing around

I see the light of your smile
Calling me all the while
You are saying, "Baby, it's time to go"
First the feeling's alright
Then it's gone from sight
So I'm taking out this time to say, whoa

Oh, if you really love me
Won't you tell me, yeah?
And if you really need me
Won't you tell me, baby? Tell me
Then I won't have to be
Playing around, no
Playing around, no

Hey, yeah
Goofing around, no
Oh baby
Playing around, no
Let me know how you feel, baby
Hey, oh baby
Playing around no, oh
Hey, goofin' around, baby...

12 ContributorsToo Shy To Say Lyrics
You make me smile
You make me sing
You make me feel good's everything
You bring me up
When I've been down
This only happens when you're around

And I can't go on this way
With it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you

I wanna fly
Away with you
Until there's nothing more for us to do
I wanna be
More than a friend
Until the end of an endless end

And I can't go on this way
With it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you
And I can't go on this way
Feelin' it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you
Ooh, ooh, I do

Evil, why have you destroyed so many minds?
Leaving room for darkness, where lost dreams can hide
Evil, why do you infest our purest thoughts, with hatred?
Evil, why have you stolen so much love?
Leaving everyone's emotions lost and wandering free, hey-yeah
Evil, why have you taken over God's children's eyes? Evil
Evil, before they could really grow to see
That your way, is not the way, to make, life what it should be
Evil, why have you destroyed, you've destroyed so much of this doggone world?

Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love’s passion

Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love’s glory

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

Itchin' to come outside
Messin' with your conscience
In a way your face can't hide
Oh things are gettin' real funky
Down at the old corral
And it's not the skunks that are stinkin'
It's the stinkin' lies you tell
What did your mama tell you about lies
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one
What did your daddy tell you about lies
He said one white one turns into a black one
So, it's gettin' ready to blow
It's gettin' ready to show
Somebody shot off at the mouth and
We're gettin' ready to know
It's gettin' ready to drop
It's gettin' ready to shock
Somebody done turned up the heater
An'a it's gettin' ready to pop
Crevices in your pantry
Now what do we have in here
Havin' a daytime nightmare
Has always been your biggest fear

Oh things are gettin' real crucial
Up the old wazoo
Yet you cry, why am I the victim?
When the culprit's Y-O-U, oo oh
What did your mama tell you about lies
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one
What did your daddy tell you about lies

We're gettin' ready to speak
It's gettin' ready to jive
It's gettin' ready to gel
Somebody done gone let the lid off
We're gettin' ready to smell

They're gettin' ready to deal
You're gettin' ready to ill
Somebody done just dropped the big dime
And they're gettin' ready to squeal
It's gettin' ready to turn
We're gettin' ready to learn
Somebody done fired up the brimstone
And you're gettin' ready to burn
It's gettin' ready to shake
You're gettin' ready to ache
Somebody done snitched to the news crew
And it's gettin' ready to break
You're gettin' ready to lie
They're gettin' ready to spy
Somebody's been put on the hot seat
And you're gettin' ready to fry

She's a miss beautiful supreme
A girl that others wish that they could be
If there's seven wonders of the world
Then I know she's got to be number one

She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes

She's the sunflower from nature's seed
A girl that some men only find in their dreams
When she smiles, it seems the stars all know
'Cause one by one, they start to light up the sky

She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
I love ya, baby

Saxophone, right here
Girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
Devastating beauty
Pretty girl with ebony eyes

When she starts talking soft and sweet
Like birds of spring, her words all seem to sing
With a rhythm that is made of love
And the happiness that she only brings

She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
I love you, baby

Saxophone, one more time
Girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
Devastating beauty
Pretty girl with ebony eyes

Lonely one of young, so brokenhearted, 
Traveling down the rigid road of life
Using pharmaceutical extractions to find
Your paradise
Finds the high, but comes down feeling lower, 
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray
Looking up to Heaven for the answer, 
They hear a voice that says –

"You will know"
"Troubled heart, you'll know –
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show"
"Oh, you will know
Troubled heart, you'll know
Every life has reason
For I made it so"

Single parent, trying to raise their children
But they would much rather not alone
Reaches out to find that special someone to make
Their house a home
Finds someone, but no one is the right one
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray

They hear a voice that says –

All the gold in all the world
Is nothing to possess
If all the things that it can bring
Can't add up to one ounce of your happiness

And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there

A diamond that shines
Like a star in the sky
Is nothing to behold
For minuscule is any light
If it can't like you brighten up my soul

For your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
Oh yeah

I could have never fathomed this
Such joy, love, and tenderness
That you give to me, yeah
For the love I feel inside
It's so wonderful I can't hide
And I glow, I glow
With just the thought of you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
One more time
For your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll, I'll be right there, yeah
Come on, one more time
And for your love

What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?

I'm thinkin' how will we survive
When the freedom that we have's a façade? Yeah

You say you're sick and tired of us protesting
I say, "Not tired enough to make a change"
You say, "Just you hold on"
I say "No way, 'cause we can't put it in the hands of fate"
Can't put it in the hands of fate, now, baby, uh
You say that you believe that all lives matter
I say, I don't believe the fuck you do
You say, "All things in time"
I say, "That's why I'm not gonna put it in the hands of fate"

Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Not gon' put it in the hands of fate now, baby
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
No, no, no, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait

In the not so distant tomorrow
Robins will sing your lullaby
But I've seen too many of our generations
Live and die for that pie in the sky

You say, "Those innocent lives should've not been taken"
And I say, "For them is why we take a knee"
You say, "Is that the right play?"
I say, "First Amendment everyday 'cause we can't put it in the hands of fate"

Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
No, no, no, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
We can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Come on

In the not so distant tomorrow (Yeah)
Robins will sing your lullaby (Woah)
But I've seen too many of our generations
Live and die for that pie in the sky

Yeah, we went from fields into a field
Bodies hittin' the ground, and so we gotta take a kneel
Mothers missin', kid's attorneys say they oughta take a deal
They determine that the price of life is just a couple mill'
And bricks are meant to build, and fire's meant to light
And souls are meant to rest and living soldiers gotta fight
We don't need no politics to try to justify the plight
It's a problem of the people, it's no longer black and white (Yeah)

Look, said we ain't talkin' no more, we gettin' to it (Ha)
Can't put it in the hands of fate, this how we do it (Ha)
Now let me go and get with all of my people, you know I have to get
That'll show me sacrifice just like my brother Colin Kaepernick
Opportunities that I get to talk, you know I have to spit
Breonna Taylor turn in her grave, you know we have to get justice
And stay in your place, we still focused on the outcome of George Floyd case (Floyd case)
While you out here doin' the minimal (Ha)
Everything about us still live by the principle (Ha)
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait

You say now you really truly get it
I say, "How much you do will let me know"
You say, "I'm so ready"
I say, "Let's do this, and not just put it in the hands of fate"

Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
No, no, no, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
We can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby

[Song 74: You’ve Got It Bad Girl]
13 ContributorsYou’ve Got It Bad Girl Lyrics
When you believe in a feeling
That's holding you back from my love
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl
When you insist on excluding
The tenderness that's in my kiss
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

If you try to display an emotion that will contradict itself
You will find your heart just sitting
Like a statue on a shelf, on a shelf, on a shelf

Should you depend on an outlet
Through which an escape can be found
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl
If you don't see there's no way out
Just no way of getting 'round me
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

Yes, you know the plans I am making are intended to capture you
So you practice false reaction
To delay the things I do, the things I do, things I do
Oh foolish you

You've got it bad girl (You've got it bad)
You've got it bad girl (You've got it bad girl)
Mmm hmm, yeah yeah
You've got it bad girl (You've got it bad)
You've got it bad girl (You've got it bad)

There's no reward in detouring, my deep sincerity
Especially since what you're feeling
Is perfectly clear to me, clear to me, clear to me

Before you discover the feeling
You've tried very hard to hide
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl
But when you can find just a small space
To let my love live in your mind
Then you'll have it good girl, you'll have it good girl

You'll have it good girl (You'll have it good girl)
You'll have it good girl (You'll have it good)
You'll have it good girl
(You'll have it good, you'll have it good, you'll have it good girl)
You'll have it good girl
You'll have it good girl (You'll have it good, you'll have it good)
You'll have it good girl
(You'll have it good, you'll have it good, you'll have it good)
You'll have it good girl (Baby baby)
You'll have it good girl

11 ContributorsHeaven Is 10 Zillion Light Years Away Lyrics
They say that heaven is ten zillion light years away
And just the pure at heart will walk her righteous streets someday
They say that heaven is ten zillion light years away
But if there is a God, we need Him now
"Where is your God?"
That's what my friends ask me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come

Tell me, people
Why can't they say that hate is ten zillion light years away?
Why can't the light of good shine God's love in every soul?
Why must my color black make me a lesser man?
I thought this world was made for every man
He loves us all, that's what my God tells me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come

But in my heart I can feel it, yeah
Feel His spirit, whoa whoa, whoa
Feel it, yeah
Feel His spirit

I can't say that heaven is ten zillion light years away
But if so let all be pure at heart
Just to walk her righteous streets I pray
Let God's love shine within to save our evil souls
For those who don't believe will never see the light
"Where is my God?"
He lives inside of me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come
People, "Where is your God?"
Inside, please let Him be
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come

But if you open your heart you can feel it, yeah yeah
Feel His spirit, whoa whoa, whoa
Feel it, yeah
You can feel His spirit
I opened my heart one morning and
I sho nuff could feel it, yeah yeah
Feel His spirit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can feel it, yeah
Feel His spirit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I met her at lover's park
One rainy April Monday
Smiling soft and warm as on
A clear December Sunday
Wearing taffeta and lace
That matched her braided hair
With their coraled beads that sang to me
She said "hi" and asked me why
Was I looking with sorrow
When there were much brighter days
In store for me tomorrow
I looked up at her and smiled
And said, why I don't know
But would she agree, to stay with me
And she said

Never in your sun, she said
Never in your sun, then she said
I will only come
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain


So if you are at lover's park
And someone looks with sorrow
Ask them why are they so sad
When sunshine's theirs tomorrow
They'll reply they don't know why
And ask you please to stay
Until the end of time, and when they're fine

Be kind and say
Never in your sun, just tell them
Never in your sun, then say
I will only come
In your pouring rain, to relieve the pain, never, ever
Never in your sun, never in your sun, believe that
I will only come
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain

Can we fix our nation's broken heart?
Are we brave enough to try? Mm-mm
Can we fix our nation's broken heart
And leave a better world behind?

'Cause if we listen to different thoughts and points of views
All my brothers and sisters, we don't have to lose humanity
We're family, so can we please
Fix our nation's broken heart?

Children marching down the boulevard
Tears are streaming down their face, oh-oh
Tension in the air is so bizarre
Love has gone without a trace

People pushing and shouting and fighting through the haze
And all this sadness, madness, help me take away the pain, it's gotta change
This can't stay the same, so tell me please
Can we fix our nation's broken heart?

Poverty and homelessness
Can we do away with this?
All we need to is to be giving
For our daughters and our sons
There's a light in everyone
They deserve a new beginning, yeah

Will the light we share survive the dark
Or will it slowly fade away? Ah-ah
Will the light of good be torn apart
And swept away by crushing waves?

We've been floating alone in a dark and bitter cold
'Cause there's a growing ocean of lies that we've been told to tear us down
But what I've found is with our truth, compassion, and love
We can fix our nation's broken heart


Can we fix our nation's broken heart?
Are we brave enough to try? Hey-ey
We must fix our nation's broken heart
To leave a better world behind

We've come together with purpose far bigger than you and me
Don't have no time for hatred and negativity, it's you and me
We hold the key, so tell me please
Can we fix our nation's broken heart?


Can we fix our nation's broken heart?
I know and you know
We must fix our nation's broken heart

Leaving a problem in your life

'Cause now I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life
And now I'm looking for another love
And now I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life
I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life

[Song 88: So What the Fuss?]
9 ContributorsSo What the Fuss? Lyrics
If I'm caught at a dance party without my dancing shoes
And everybody dances on my bare feet
Shame on me
If I'm minding my business just doing the right thing
And you try to front me off in the street
Shame on you
If a family's waiting for that special blessing to
Come their way
But they ain't trying to get on their knees and pray
Shame on them
And if we live in a time where every nation's fighting
Around the world
Yet we can't all agree that peace is the way
Shame on us

Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

If i gotta get up early in the morning for a job Interview
And I forget to set the stupid alarm
Shame on me
If my children are playing outside like little children do
And you come around there trying to bring them some harm
Shame on you
Should i be driving thru a klantown, find a restaurant
To get me some food
And someone says "Hey boy, we don't serve your kind"
Shame on them
And if we live in a democracy and you don't use your power to vote
Knowing some would like to turn back the hands of time
Shame on us

Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

If I'm hooked on a habit knowing damn well it could
Cost me my life
Yet I keep doing what I should do without
Shame on me
If you're locked in a marriage and your other half
Just gives you abuse
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out
Shame on you
If we're jamming the music and somebody's got the
Audacity
To say that they can jam it better than us
Shame on them
And should there be just a handful that believe that
We are totally free
And there's no need to fight for equality
Shame on us

Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

What the fuss 

[Song 89: Stay Gold]
5 ContributorsStay Gold Lyrics
Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time
So gold

Steal away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever
And be in time
Stay gold

But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory?
And yes you say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold

Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold
Gold, gold, gold, gold

I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

All my life, I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
But now, I see there's joy inside your heart
Every day, I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now, I see this star is on Earth

And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
(That's what you told me, yeah)
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be
(That's the way it will always be)
Ever since the day you came inside my life

Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, I love you

And that's the way you said that it would be

If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said it would be

If I should ever bring you inside my life

Happier than the morning sun
That's the way you said that it would be

If I should ever bring you inside my life, yeah

If I should ever bring you inside my life

I believe that everyone should be
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun

Moon blue, moon blue
Your hearts just caught up in the moon blue

Moon blue, rivers of love you shine, bathe me in light sublime
Flood me with all your glowing heart can give
Moon blue, memories bind like chains
When will you come again
I wait in darkness just for your bright to beam

Because I'm not afraid of the consequence
Of being in love with you
And I'd rather be alone some nights
Awaiting your full hue
For though the sun makes bright the day
My world is dark when there's no you
You light my skies and make dark night bright day, moon blue

Moon blue, your beauty's seen by all, the yearning of your call
Travels the world and then makes home my soul
Moon blue, lift me to starry heights, i long to live within your light
Solace of mind, my heart is yours for always

[Song 93: The Secret Life Of Plants]
4 ContributorsThe Secret Life Of Plants Lyrics
I can't conceive the nucleus of all
Begins inside a tiny seed
And what we see as insignificant
Provides the purest air we breathe

But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being
For these are but a few discoveries
We find inside the Secret Life of Plants

A species smaller than the eye can see
Or larger than most living things
And yet we take from it without consent
Our shelter, food, habiliment

But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being
For these are but a few discoveries
We find inside the Secret Life of Plants

But far too many give them in return
A stomp, cut, drown, or burn
As if they're nothing
But if you ask yourself where would you be
Without them you will find you would not
And some believe antennas are their leaves
That spans beyond our galaxy
They've been, they are and probably will be
Who are the mediocrity

But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being
For these are but a few discoveries
We find inside the Secret Life of Plants

There ain't no reason for us sitting down
To try to talk our problem out
'Cause we know the truth, it ain't no use
Each other we must do without
There ain't no reason trying to force a smile
When pain is really in its place
'Cause we know the truth, it ain't no use
Let's part before we lose love's trace

(we've got to say)
Whoa oh oh
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Whoa oh oh
(bye bye, bye bye bye)
Whoa oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh

As I look back I'm really trying to see
Just what it was that made us spark
'Cause the fire's out, it leaves no doubt
The flame's not burning in our hearts
We still are young and both of us have time
To find our winter love in spring
Yes, we know the truth, it ain't no use
We're not each other's everything

(So we might say bye)
Whoa oh oh

1 ContributorMy Love LyricsMy love is warmer than a smile
My love gives to every needing child
If anyone should ask you who's my true love
Tell them my love true
Is ever letting all their love come through
My love sees love with not a face
And lives to love through time and space
If all of everything about my love
Fits to the tune of you
Then you can say that you are my love too
(1st chorus)
Let my love shine through out the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Let it reach out to every heart
To every disenfranchised people
'Til it is present and no more
Is pain all over
Our love sees love's the key to peace
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased
Should you or anyone you know enough
To say they feel as we
Then let our universal song be free

(2nd chorus)
Let our love shine through out the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Say words of love to all we see
To rich and poor for love is equal
Let us lift up humanity
Spread love all over
Let all its forces join as one
So to rebuke all signs of evil
Through every valley, land and sea
Our love's all people

[Song 96: Free]
9 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisFree Lyrics
Free like the river
Flowing freely through infinity
Free to be sure of
What I am and who I need not be
Free from all worries
Worries prey on oneself's troubled mind
Freer than the clock's hands
Tickin' way the times
Freer than the meaning of free that man defines
Life running through me
'Til I feel my father God has called

Me having nothin'
But possessing riches more than all
And I'm free
To be nowhere
But in every place I need to be
Freer than a sunbeam
Shining through my soul
Free from feelin' heat or knowing bitter cold
Free from conceiving the beginning
For that's the infinite start
I'm gone - gone but still living
Life goes on without a beating heart
Free like a vision
That the mind of only you can see
Freer than a raindrop
Falling from the sky
Freer than a smile in a baby's sleepin' eyes

I'm free like a river
Flowin' freely through infinity
I'm free to be sure of what
I am and who I need not to be
I'm much freer, than the meaning of the word free that man, oh, man defines
Free, free like the vision that
The mind of only you are ever gonna see
Free like the river
My life goes on and on through infinity

7 ContributorsGirl Blue Lyrics
Hello, morning
Good, good morning to the one I love
Crystal ringlets paint a picture of a gold sunrise above

Little girl, you're sad
Though all you have is visible to you
Within your heart, there stays a part
That, like the sky, is blue

Shifting breezes grace the inner spectrum of your glance
Leaves on branches, for your pleasure, perform a soothing dance

Little girl, it seems
In all my dreams
Your happiness is due
But still they last
They're in your past
Events that make you blue

Thoughts of love are in your mind
Yet, splintered hopes push them aside
A look at life is what you need to try

In an instant, there'll be sunshine
Sprinkled every place
Drops of rain will kiss the softness of your lovely face

Little girl, be fair
Show yourself you care
Let others care for you
Before it's too late
'Cause time won't wait
'Til your heart's no longer blue


Little girl, be smart
Don't break your own heart
There is love waiting for you
Before it's too late
'Cause time won't wait
'Til your heart's no longer blue

Points only to yourself to blame
For the negative karma you will be receiving
Because when people are oppressed
With atrocities that test
The future of all mankind we, the world won't stand seeing


The rules I need not recite
For you know what's wrong and what's right
So strike down your barbaric rules and cruel restrictions
The clock of now says it's time
For you to make up your mind
Before it's too late for you to earn your redemption

You just could not know how long we tried
To see how this building looks inside
This must be a lucky day for me
Because the sign says there's a vacancy

Look I know you came a long way
But you made it just too late
So we had to give it to somebody else

Well I talked to you on the phone less than fifteen minutes ago
And you told me that it was cool
I graduated from Howard U
My job is paying good money too
And if you check on my resume
You'll find they all wanted me to stay

Well I can't take the time out
To check your credit card
‘Cause the computer just broke down today

Well I'll stop by here tomorrow to complete our interview
But I know what you're gonna say
I know what your bottom line is

You might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here
Too bad, too sad

Our first child is due here any day
That's why we're desperate for a place to stay
The location is so perfect too
So please try to do what you can do

Well in this apartment complex no children are allowed
And if you told me that I could have saved you a lot of time

Well I thought the bill was passed that said you could not discriminate
But I know some excuse you'll find
Because your bottom line is

You might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here
Too bad, too sad

Aye, you might be a great doctor
You might be a great lawyer
You might possess the key to the city
Or may be a politician

You might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash
But you can not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here
Too bad, too sad

Where is the missing one, the missing one
Where is the missing one, the missing one

There is a missing person that I've just got to find
Now just how long they have been gone
I can't say at this time
I glanced outside my window surprisingly to see
The reflection of a broken man who looked somewhat like me

I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do?
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait, I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you
Where is the missing one, the missing one

I looked inside an album of happy photographs
To try to match the feeling
In the joy I used to have
I traveled through the moments that held a special place
But every time what came to mind is that smile upon your face

I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do?
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait, I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you
Where is the missing one, the missing one
I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do?
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait, I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere lost in yesterday with you
I am trying to find my whereabouts, what can I do?
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait, I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere lost in yesterday with you
Where is the missing one, the missing one
Where is the missing one, the missing one
Where is the missing one, the missing one, yeah
Where is the missing one, the missing one

[Song 106: Front Line]
4 ContributorsFront Line Lyrics
I am a veteran of the war
I up and joined the army back in 1964
At sixteen I just had to be a man at any cost
I volunteered for Vietnam where I got my leg shot off

I recall a quote from a movie that said "Who's more a man
Than a man with a reason that's worth dying for"

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead

They gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill
To stop the big urge I might have for the wrong kind of thrill
They put a gun in my hand and said, "Shoot until he's dead
But it's hard to kill when 'please, I'm your friend' echoes through your head

Brought up in church taught no man should take another's life
But then put in a jungle where life has no price

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead

Back in the world the paper reads today
Another war is in the brewing
But what about the lives of yesterday
And the many happy families that have been ruined

My niece is a hooker and my nephew's a junkie too
But they say I have no right to tell them how they should do
They laugh and say "Quit bragging" 'bout the war you should never have been in
But my mind is so brain-washed I'd probably go back and do it again

I walk the neighborhood parading my purple heart
With a fear of agent orange that no one will stop, no

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead, yeah
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
Now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead
Could you believe I do?
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead

Pan is my name

I have to keep the score of things around you
Fire and air
Earth, water I prepare
I am the piper at the gates of dawning

It's not magic it's not madness
Just the elements I style
And I guarantee faithfully I will never go
Until all is said and done
In a twinkling, I'll be gone
Well excuse me I have so much more to do

Fancy I fell
A childlike tap I'll steal
Look twice my friend it's not the wind at all
You'll never see
What you refuse to be
The power in the seeing is believing

It's not magic it's not madness
Just the elements I style

Well excuse me I have so much more to do

Purple rain drops, spotted flowers
I've daydreamed for hours
Since I met you, I can't forget you
Oh, what am I gonna do?
I see funny things, many strange things
I think that you've changed things
Since i met you, I can't live without you
What am i gonna do?

I just can't tell you how I feel
I just can't find the words
To share a love like ours
Takes more than nouns and verbs

I hear bells ring, I hear angels sing
I know just what that means
Since I met you (Met you), I just can't forget you (Can't forget you)
Oh, what am I gonna do?
Ooh, what am I gonna do?

On the beach where young lovers meet
You can see them there as they sit and build
Castles in the sand

Heavenly, she's so heavenly
When she smiles at you and she helps you build
Castles in the sand

The time comes when you stop pretending
For all dreams must come to an ending
Remember what happens to castles of sand
The sea will wash them away, oh

On the beach where they used to meet
By the sand and sea, waves have washed away
Castles in the sand

Castles in the sand
Where did they go?
Castles in the sand
Tell me, where did they go?
Castles in the sand
I wanna know where did they go
Castles in the sand
Please tell me where did they go

Me and my heart took a
Vow from the start and a
Vow to my heart i never break
Seasons may come and the
Seasons may go but know
Through every time and space
My love will always stay forever and always

From the bottom of my heart, i love you
I can say these words to you without delay
If you're wondering just how long i'll love you
Try forever that's how long i'll feel this way

Me and my heart got a
Promise from the stars that they'd
Keep this love burning endlessly
People will come just as
People will go but know
Whatever life has in store
Through all eternity you will have my love for always


Yes, forever is how long my love will stay
Forever is a long, long time
But so what?

[Song 111: Go Home]
7 ContributorsGo Home Lyrics
Her parents said, "Girl, don't leave home"
But her heart kept cheering her on
She had a real good man, a steady job
But the two of them just weren't in her heart

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, "Girl, you're wrong, go home"

Long days, short nights when you're on the road
For a pretty girl, it's a heavy load
And even so, who'll pay your fare?
She said, "I'll make it on a wing and a prayer"

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, "Girl, you're wrong, go home"

She said I've no right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, "Girl, you're wrong, go home"

She said I've no right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word
My final word, yeah, yeah

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, "Girl, you're wrong, go home"

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying, "Girl, you're wrong, go home"

Go home, baby
You better go home right now
Go home, little girl, you better go home
Go home, girl
Go home, little girl, you better go home
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah

I look inside my crystal ball of desire
And know why rapid beats my heart
I see the spark, I feel the flame of the fire
Letting me know love wants to start
No more playing around
No more waiting around for the special one to come
No more wearing a frown
No more tears coming down 'cause I know what I want
And I want what I know

It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, it's you, you're that angel sent from Heaven above
It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, you're that angel sent from Heaven above, for me
(For you and you, for me)
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited, my life would be undone
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited for you

I looked behind and what I sight is the mire
So very lonely was my heart
I look ahead, I hear the sound of the choir
Singing that love will never part
No more hearing the sound of the rain coming down
No more I can't see the sun
No more hurting for fun 'cause the moment has come
When I know what I want
And I want what I know

It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you
You're that angel sent from Heaven above
It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, it's you, you're that angel sent from Heaven above, for me
(For you and you, for me)
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited, my life would be undone
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited for you
Oh baby
It's you (Oh)
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you (You)
You're that angel sent from Heaven above
It's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, it's you, it's you and you're that angel sent from Heaven above, for me
(For you and you, for me)
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited, my life would be undone
If only I had not waited, I would have picked the wrong one (Wrong one)
If only I had not waited for you
'Cause baby, it's you

Yester-me yester-you yesterday

What happened to the world we knew?
When we would dream and scheme
And while the time away
Yester-me yester-you yesterday

Where did it go that yester glow?
When we could feel
The wheel of life turn our way
Yester-me yester-you yesterday

I had a dream, so did you
Life was warm and love was true
Two kids who followed all the rules
Yester fools
And now now it seems those yester dreams
Were just a cruel and foolish game we used to play
Yester-me yester-you yesterday

When I recall what we had
I feel lost I feel sad with nothing but
The memory of yester love and now
Now it seems those yester dreams
Were just a cruel and foolish game we had to play
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
Sing with me
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
One more time

Am I seeing what I think I see
Or are my eyes playing tricks on me?
'Cause what I see don't make no sense
Looking so good standing over that vent
Earth Venus in broad daylight
The Goddess of Love is in my sight
I gotta catch a hold of myself
'Cause if I don't I'll have nothing left

Imagine you're sitting at ring side
And I'm standing on the inside
And approaching is Miss Matador
I'm on the charge for

The woman in red
The woman in red
Like fine wine she's going straight to my head
The woman in red (The woman in red)
The woman in red (See the woman in red)
I'll settle for nothing less than her instead

M-M-Miss, please pardon me
Now listen to me, I can hardly speak
I haven't been this much confused
Since Daddy caught me trying on his shoes
Now, I'm too old to be acting like this
But there's something about her I just can't resist
My heart is beating like a big bass drum
And my mind is saying that girl's the one

Imagine you're sitting at ring side
And I'm standing on the inside
And approaching is Miss Matador
I'm on the charge for

The woman in red (The woman in red)

Then I wished that I could come back

How I wished that I could come back
As a flower, as a flower
To spread the sweetness of love
To spread the sweetness of love

The dew had finished making love to many
A rainbow smelling sweet was in the air
I envied all the silence I saw growing
So unmoved by things outside of themselves

And how I wished that I could come back
As a flower, as a flower, as a flower
How I wished that I could come back
As a flower, as a flower

Until she was too pleased

Now I believe you're just like me
In that you understand

7 ContributorsIf Your Love Cannot Be Moved Lyrics
You can't say we shall and not fight through hell
You can't say we will and not dare to deal
You can't shout out peace and then vanish in the crowd
You can't ride the storm without some effect
You can't steal the spoil and not pay the debt
You can't wave a sign that spells "evil" and feel really proud
You can't sing a song with no melody
You can't say we're one without unity
You can't form a line if you're sacred to stand alone
You can't pray for grace and then smack her face
You can't speak of hope and then crack a joke
You can say you're there but time knows how much you've grown
Put a face to your somebody

Can you say your name?
Or would you rather stay unknown?
Can you show your face?
Or are you fearful of it shown?
Can you feel your heart?
Or does it beat for you alone?
Lift your glass up high
Say that your truth will never lie
If your love cannot be moved

You can't look at me and not see yourself
You can't say "for them" and not for who else
You can't truly bless and not bless the good of all
You can't serve the rich and desert the poor
You can't hear their cries and just close the door
You can't say you're down and not take it to the wall
You can't benefit from one's detriment
You can't find the serum and not cure the sick
You can't free the slave to enslave them differently
You can't see the right only from your sight
You can't see the wrong and just go along
Or is that the way you would want your fate to read
Put a face to your somebody


You can't make a pledge and then slip the script
You can't say the words and not move your lips
You can't be confused and still say you understand
You can't be a friend but not through thin and thick
You can't be a click but in danger split
You can't evenly share and then grab the biggest hand
You can't say you do but then show you don't
You can't say you will and make sure you won't
You can't want for change and not do what you need to do

You can't give up all and then take back all you give
You can't live to die but you can die to live
Or is that too much to ask of the you in you?
Put a face to your somebody

Since age one Keita knew he had the answer
And it was that someday he'd be a dancer
And with help from his sis
Surely that boy would not miss
From being the baddest dancer in the whole neighborhood
Late at night when he was supposed to be sleeping
You could hear the pitter patter of feet creeping
To where music would play
To his sister he would say
Before his father said, "Hey boy, get right back in that bed"

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it, oh oh
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it

Once at school they put on a talent contest
To find out who could really boogie the best
But his mama said, no
"Keita's much too young to go"
But his sister said, "Please let him go so the world can see"
When they saw him they said, "He must be crazy
Look at him, he ain't nothing but a baby"
But soon as he began
You knew the contest he would win
Because everyone in the audience began to cheer

Show me how to do like you

'Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else
She's taken her heart
And put it away under lock and key
But it's high time
And miss lady girl sets her heart free and gives her love to me, yeah

But some think that diamond rings, fancy cars
Will make a big impression, yeah, ha!
But I know that all she needs is my tender
Love and affection
'Cause she still says

That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh, no
But someone's gotta get it
I know that I will (Hee-hee! Hee-hee! Aaow!)
No one's gonna get it (Da-da-da) (Ooh!)
No one's gonna get it, oh, no (Da-da-da)
But someone's gotta get it (Da-da-da)
And I know that I will be the one who will (Hee-hee! Hee-hee! Aaow!)
Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it, get it

Miss lady girl, ha!
Has buried her feelings deep inside
'Cause she don't want, ah
To be taken for another ride
She's sick and tired, ha!
Of being on that lonely merry-go-round
She just don't know
That the ultimate love
Of her life is about to be found, hoo!

They think that ready cash, flashy clothes
Will fill her life with laughter
But I've got the very thing that she needs
True love forever after
Then no more will she say

That no one's gonna get it

[Song 125: Peace Wanted Just to Be Free]
2 ContributorsPeace Wanted Just to Be Free LyricsSweet woman child needn't cry anymore
Now we all know what you've long known before
Sad that it took all one's lifetime to see
Peace wanted just to be free
Strong man shall open your armor of fear
Your dreams of love is what brought this day here
Evil is lost and hate has decease, joy is of what we feast
For life can now live in world peace
Dormi piccino la guerra e finita
L'acqua ed il vento saranno con te
E poi cresci piccino nell'Africa unita
Dormi che noi siamo qui
Dormi noi siamo con te
Rritorneranno le danze e i colori
Contiueranno per sempre con te
Ritroveremo profumi e i sapori
Piccolo amore
Per ogni stella che cade nel cielo
Un nuovo amore fiorisce laggiù
Bimbi che corrono e giocano i pace
E che non piangono più
E che non piangono...

Sweet woman child needn't cry anymore
Now we all know what you've long known before
Sad that it took a world's lifetime to see
Peace wanted just to be free, peace wanted just to be free
Soldiers have put down their weapons of war
Never to touch them again
All through the love you can hear people say
Where fighting has come to an end
Dormi piccino nell'Africa nuova
Armi e i soldati non urlano più
Sogna la notte di luci stellata
Dormi noi siamo con te
Dormi che noi siamo qui
Dormi noi siamo con te

What happened to the world we knew?
When we would dream and scheme
And while the time away?
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday
Mm, yeah

Where did it go (Where did it go?), that yester-glow?
When we could feel
The wheel of life turn our way
Yester-me. yester-you, yesterday

I had a dream. so did you
Life was warm and love was true
Two kids who followed all the rules
Yester-fools, and now

Now it seems (Now it seems) those yester-dreams
Were just a cruel
And foolish game we used to play
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday

When I recall what we had
I feel lost, I feel sad
With nothing but the memory of
Oh, yester-love, and now

Now it seems (Now it seems) those yester-dreams
Were just a cruel
And foolish game we had to play

Mmhmm, yester-me, yester-you, yesterday
Sing it with me

7 ContributorsDid I Hear You Say You Love Me Lyrics
Did I hear you say you love me?
Well baby, I've got to know
‘Cause if you really really love me
You've got to do things to show
Don't give me the wrong impression
By showing me warm expression
Put me in the right direction
With tender love and affection
I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside

Did I hear you say you need me?
Well baby, tell me the truth
‘Cause if you really really need me
My sweetness, here's what I'll do
Cut out all my crazy playing
‘Cause for your love I have been laying
Just tell me that is what you're saying
And I'll be yours without delaying
I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside

Well, if you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)
Sounds so good
Well, if you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)

Did I hear you say you want me?
Now please don't give me no mess
‘Cause if you really really want me
You've got to give me your best
Put my love life right in the pocket
And dare someone to try to top it
And when you think I want to drop it
Just love me ‘til I beg, don't stop it
‘Cause I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside

Well, if you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)
Well, if you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you love me, let me hear you say (I love you)

If you love me, let me hear you say (I love you)
And if you need me, let me hear you say (I love you)
And if you want me, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you need me, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you want me, let me hear you say (I love you)

[Song 129: Used to Be]
9 ContributorsUsed to Be Lyrics“Used to Be” peaked at #46 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #31 on Billboard’s Adult Contemporary chart in the fall of 1982.
Superman was killed in Dallas
There's no love left in the palace
Someone took the Beatles' lead guitar

Have another Chivas Regal
You're twelve years old
And sex is legal
Your parents don't know where or who you are

Used to be the hero of the ball game
Took the time to shake the loser's hand
Used to be that failure
Only meant you didn't try
In a world where people gave a damn

Great big wars in little places
Look at all those frightened faces
But don't come here
We just don't have the room

Love thy neighbor's wife and daughter
Cleanse your life with holy water
We don't need to bathe
We've got perfume

Used to be a knight in shining armor
Didn't have to own a shiny car

Dignity and courage were the measure of a man
Not the drugs he needs to hide the scar
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Can your teacher read?
Does your preacher pray?
Does your president have soul?
Have you heard a real good ethnic joke today?
Mama took her speed
Daddy ran away
But you musn't lose control

Let's cut a class
I got some grass
The kids are wild
We just can't tame 'em
Do we have the right to blame 'em

We fed 'em all our indecision
We raped their minds with television
But what the hell
They're too young to feel pain

I believe that love can save tomorrow
I believe the truth can make us free
Someone tried to say it
And we nailed him to a cross
I guess it's still the way it used to be

Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do

I never, never had a dream come true
In my every dream, I'm loved by you
And we're free as the wind
And true love is no sin
Therefore, men are men, not machines

I never, never had a dream come true
Without you, the world out there is painted shades of blue
Since our roads never cross
I work just to please the boss
Think I might as well get lost in my dreams

Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do

I never, never had a dream come true
Guess I'm going to dream about you, babe, my whole life through
Seems my folks are ashamed
Said I ain't worth a thing
But I'm glad I'm chained to my dreams

Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do
Keep on dreaming
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do
Sing along with me
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do
Keep on dreaming
Do do do do do do do do do

[Song 131: Misrepresented People]
4 ContributorsMisrepresented People Lyrics
In 1492, you came upon these shores
Seven hundred years, educated by the Moors
17th Century: genocide and the gun
Middle Passage blessed to market the Africans

In the so-called "Lands of God"
My kind were treated hard
From back then until now
I see, and you agree
We have been a misrepresented people
From back then until now
Just see my family tree
We have been a misrepresented people
We have been a misrepresented people

19th century: slavery destroyed
Soldiers who fought and won
What's known as "nigga boys"
20th century: with freedom in my hand
We invent ideas
Which helped us save a land

But while I prayed to God
My moms and pops got whored
From back then until now
You'll see our history
We have been a misrepresented people
From back then until now
Just see my family tree
We have been a misrepresented people
Yes, we have been a misrepresented people

1969: Black power's at the door
1982: Hip-Hop was on the floor
1992: Gangsta crack prevailed
1999: Our colors filled the jails
It's through the grace of God
That we all were not scarred

From back then until now
We see no comedy
We have been a misrepresented people
From back then until now
Were we still a mystery
We have been a misrepresented people
Yes, we have been a misrepresented people
Though we march across time
A sea of victories
We have been a misrepresented people
From back then until now
You know we made you grow
We have been a misrepresented people
We have been a misrepresented people
From back then until now
We see our destiny
To never be a misrepresented people
Yes, we march across to time to free
A melody
To never be a misrepresented people
No, you must never be a misrepresented people

Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain

My Sunny one shines so sincere
Oh, Sunny one so true

Oh Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, oh thank you for the love you brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Sunny one so true
I love you


Oh, yeah yeah
Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see
My sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z
My life was torn like wind-blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true
I love you

Whoa
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sunny, oh thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true
I love you

I love you, yeah

Well, the night is young
And the stars are out
And your eyes are all aglow
And you say you feel
Ways you've never felt
But are you sure? Make sure you're sure

Well, the wine is sweet
And the music sways
And your lips are so divine
And you say you know
That you're falling in love
Now, let's be mature, make sure you're sure

I'm not accustomed to wearing my feelings
In a place that's so obvious to see
But if eyes don't lie
There's a chance that you are not fooling yourself and me

Well, the night is through
And the sun's come out
And so too has your lovely smile
And you vow to stay
In these arms always
Can you endure? Now are you sure?

Love can be so insecure
So please be sure

[Song 136: Sunshine In Their Eyes]
8 ContributorsSunshine In Their Eyes Lyrics
A lonesome tear
A hungry face
A barren pain
A dream unchased

Oh, I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes

A prayer is heard
By one so small
Let love be in the
Hearts of all

Oh, I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes

You and I may never see them cry
Or wonder why the world's so cold
(You feel that they're too young
To take a look around)
But in their faces I can see the trouble all around
Today we must turn into lies
The truth already in their minds

Oh, I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes
(We can't wait to see the day there's sunshine in our eyes)
Oh no, no
(Sunshine in our eyes)

Oh my mother's worried cause she feels the world is ending
She believes that everything is coming to an end
Papa's staying real careful, 'cause his brother Sam was robbed
Trying to buy just a loaf of bread for baby John

(See how the world escaped)
All the streets turning bare
(Most of the news is bad)
Crime just feeds in the air

Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening
Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

Cost of livings up, but the pay is low down
Hate to see the babies starve cause mamma can't be found
Sister lives alone, bolts and chains the door at night
Never ever walks an alley or a shorter way

(See how the world escaped)
All the streets turning bare
(Most of the news is bad)
Crime just feeds in the air

Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening
Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

Father Bills gone fighting in a place where he's a stranger
But could men die a stranger in every war
We all hide in shame, boldly pointing to another
When the blame we know for sure is right in ourselves
In ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves

Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening
Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

I'd sing you a song, without a word
Still you would hear my tune
I'd give you a day, without a time
So it won't end too soon

Anything, I would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling, in my life
I ever had a chance to love you

I'd build you a world, made of the dreams
That dances in your head
Take a rainbow, with colors bright
To hang over your bed

Anything, I would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling, in my life
I ever had a chance to love you

Fate's been waiting for the right time
To put us in each other's arms
But why should we sit and waste time
To start right now would do no harm

Give me a sign and I will show you
The magic of which I speak
Open your heart, let me come in
My love is yours to keep

Anything, I would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling, in my life
I ever had a chance to love you
Ooh, oh, if ever I had a chance to love you

Seems the wisdom of man hasn't got much wiser
Than the very beginning of our time
Agree or war has been our way of compromising
"Let live and love" has become our biggest lie
Seems to me that fools are even more foolish
Thinking of themselves and nobody else
But then if asked for poor will riches be replenished
They say bootstraps must be pulled up by themselves

Feeding off the love of the land
Leaving much to be desired
Living off the love of the Lord
While the price for life is higher
Isn't love to be admired?
Has the good in man expired?
Stealing all the love and the beauty from the land

I awake each morning to the birds a-singing
Singing out to God to come and save his own
But when throughout the world the cry of love is ringing
Is then when He'll stop to hear our song
Did you know that when you feel the earth a-shaking
It's only Mother Nature with a crying heart
You see, we have taken from her for so many ages
Will there be a time when taking stops and giving starts?

'Cause we're feeding off the love of the land
Leaving much to be desired
Living off the love of the Lord
While the price for life is higher
Isn't love to be admired?
Has the good in man expired?
Stealing all the love and the beauty from the land

Yes, we're feeding off the love of the land
Never hearing what He's saying
Living off the love of the Lord
Never feeling what you're praying
Never praising Him for beauty
Only praying God please give me
Stealing all the love and the beauty from the land
Stealing all the love and the beauty from His land

[Song 140: My Love Is With You]
4 ContributorsMy Love Is With You Lyrics
I was just walking down the street
Looking forward to seeing the friends I was to meet
Yet what happened so tragically
Really makes for no sense at all
Suddenly two guys confronted me
Saying I was in the wrong turf, angrily
They said their colors were black but I was wearing gray
I started to turn to go back
They up and blew me away

My love is with you where ever you are
My love is with, where ever you are

Though my life they've taken
They can't take what we've shared
Spread the love I've given
And I'll be there

I was out playing with my friends
You know, doing silly things that kids do at ten
But the crossfire I was caught in
Should not have been in the first place
A dropped Monte Carlo came to a screech
Someone yelled "nobody gets away with dissent me"
Across the street a man pulled his nine
Everybody started to run
A shower of bullets rang out
Mistakenly my life was done, oh

My love is with you where ever you are
My love is with, where ever you are

Though my life they've taken
They can't take what we've shared
Spread the love I've given
I'll be there

My love is with you where ever you are
My love is with, where ever you are

When you're joyful
When you're lonely
When you're happy
When tears are streaming right down your face
In the morning
In the noon time
In the evening
In the wee wee hours of the night time hour
In the summer
In the springtime
In the autumn
In the cold long winter, winter nights
My love is with you
My love is with you my best friend
My love is with you my brother
My love is with you my sister
My love is with you my mother
My love is with you my father

I'm with you
Ban the hand gun - chant

[Song 141: Land of La La]
4 ContributorsLand of La La Lyrics
You were brought up in a small town
Where everyone greeted with a morning smile
I mean the place was so free from crime
You could leave your front door open
And if your eyes were drawn from a lack of food
Or your pockets were short on cash
There was always someone close at hand
That you could always run to
You could have been a doctor
And you could have been a nurse
But these things weren't good enough for you
So you decided to pack up all you own
And get a one-way ticket there
To a place where all the successful people went
In order for them to do

I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey
Land of la la
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey
The land of la la

You get off the bus, pick up a paper
And look through the classified
So that you might find a place
Suitable for you to move into
Then you turn around to pick up the duffle bag
That you brought along
But much to your surprise you find
Your bag has taken off walking
You dig in your wallet
To get your last dime
But then recall you just spent your last dime on the newspaper
You're much too prideful
But pride has no defense
When all you've got in your possession
Is the wallet in your hands

I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey
Land of la la
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey
Living in the land of la la

L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey, living in the land of la la

You might get everything you want
But not want everything you get
Being in la la land is like nowhere else
Living in the land, one hell of a land, a land full of lost angels
Movie stars and great big cars and Perrier and fun all day
And that's enough to make anybody go wild
In the land of la la
He's a big boy now, she's a strong girl
But only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la

[Song 142: Black Orchid]
4 ContributorsBlack Orchid Lyrics
A flake of snow within a storm
A new way waiting to be born
In a world with need of change
A touch of love in fear of hate
A rushing wind that's asked to wait
For the promises of rain
A pearl of wisdom entrapped by poverty
She gives love with purity
Filling minds with hopeful schemes
To build worlds enhanced by peace
Draped in sparkling morning dew
She expresses life anew
From the earth beneath her feet
She is a flower that grows
In love ability
She's femininity

Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why did they make you begin
When they know in time you'll find your truth
Before your cycle ends
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why are you crying their fears
When the true reflection of you that they see
Is love besieged by years

She has touched the farthest star
Her beauty speaks of what we are
And her freedom makes us free
Her now is in eternity
Infinite to all that see
And her dreams have been achieved
Now there is a sound of laughter
Nature signs out her name
For the world to know her fame

Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why did they criticize
When they knew your love could cast its spell and
Consecrate their eyes
Black Orchid, Black Orchid
Why do you linger in space
When you know in every heart that beats
You hold a special place
When you know in every heart that beats
You hold a special place

4 ContributorsWith Each Beat Of My Heart Lyrics
Honey, sweet
I've got something to say to you in privacy
Something I'd like for you to hear
And only your ears alone
Secretly, I've been admiring you intensely
So much so I'd like to settle down with you
And make a home

You are my first breath
My first smile
And my morning cup of tea
Yours is the love
That I pray for
Before I go to sleep
From the time I saw your face
I knew no other could erase
My loving you with each beat of my heart
Until the day I heard you speak
I didn't know that sound was sweet
Me hearing you in each beat of my heart
There's a time when playing ends
And the serious begins
Like the love that I felt from the start
With each beat of my heart

Honey, sweet
I soared into a heaven's galaxy
So hypnotized was I
From seeing all the magic in your eyes
So I bring
To you what's been a lifetime fantasy
Of being with the only one who can
Create my paradise

You are my first breath
My first smile
And my morning cup of tea
Yours is the love
That I pray for
Before I go to sleep
From the time I saw your face
I knew no other could erase
My loving you with each beat of my heart
Until the day I heard you speak
I didn't know that sound was sweet
Me hearing you in each beat of my heart
There's a time when playing ends
And the serious begins
Like the love that I felt from the start
With each beat of my heart
There's a time when playing ends
And the serious begins
Like the love that I felt from the start
With each beat of my heart

[Song 144: Dancing to the Rhythm]
1 ContributorDancing to the Rhythm Lyrics
Lonely, my life used to be lonely
Lonely like the single lonely number one
Lonely like a lonely sun
Without a single iota to shine upon, yeah
Crying, deep inside I was crying
Like the muddy Mississippi, my tears flowed
Carrying with it my lonely soul
Leaving no clue of who, where or what I would become

Oh, oh, oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life
But oh, was I lifted when I let your light inside my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you
In my, my, my, my li-li-life

I'm dancing to the rhythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever grateful for your love

Money, oh, how did I have money
Enough to last me from start 'til the end of time
With some more to leave behind
And yet I was a cent-less pauper in distress, hey hey
I can, feel the very presence of your love here
Though I've never seen the pleasure of your smile
No, I've never touched your hand
And yet you've given me eternal happiness

Oh, oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life
Oh, was I lifted when I let your light inside my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you in my
My, my, my li-li-life

I'm dancing to the rhythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever grateful for your sweet, sweet love
I'm dancing to the rhythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever grateful for your sweet, sweet love
I'm dancing to the rhythm of your love
Forever grateful for your love


Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life
Oh, was I lifted when I let God's light inside my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you
In my, my, my, my li-li-life

I'm dancing to the rhythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Giving all praises for your sweet, sweet love

Forever grateful for your love

[Song 145: Do Yourself a Favor]
6 ContributorsDo Yourself a Favor Lyrics
Isolated junk yard
Letting out the garbage
Eating through the core of life
Sweet fragrance irritates
In a stale room, death awaits
Persecute your own self pride

Suffocate the new high
Ride a thorny mule that cries
Dig your grave and step right in
Like a Judas, pay the price
Thirty pieces for a ride
Here's the fire, take a chew

Do yourself a favor
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey, there ain't much time
Ah, do yourself a favor
Educate your mind
Ah, get yourself together
Hey, there ain't much time

Shredded know-how give away
Species of the human race
Those funky winds of ups and downs
Hall of grit is known too well
Heaven still is your hell
Poison slowly, slowly drowns

Let the devil step right in
Lucifer's your only friend
Ain't a soul gonna pity you
Hurdle over time to death
With open arms, it waits, I bet
Don't you wish you could reach ground?

Do yourself a favor
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey, there ain't much time
Do yourself a favor
Educate your mind
Ah, get yourself together
Hey, there ain't much
Hey, there ain't much time
There ain't much time

Hey, don't you feel yourself goin' down?
You're goin' down
Hey, don't you feel yourself goin' down?
You're goin' down
Hey, don't you feel your brains, baby?
You're goin' down

Do yourself a favor
Educate your mind, dummy
Ah, get yourself together
Hey, there ain't much time
Ah, do yourself a favor
Educate your mind
Ah, get yourself funky together
Hey, there ain't
There ain't much time

One, two
Three, four
Five, six, seven
Eight, nine, ten
Uh, what's that letter
Comes after ten?

Ah, don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't worry
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
Don't you know I don't believe
I'll ever go to hell?

Do yourself a favor
Do yourself a favor
Yeah, yeah, educate your mind
Do yourself a favor
Do yourself a favor, do yourself a favor
Educate your mind, dummy

One little Christmas tree was standing alone
Waiting for someone to come by
One little Christmas tree that never had grown
Cried as he looked up to the sky
Oh, please Mr. Father tree, the tallest of all
I'm so afraid and so alone
Could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small
Light up someone's home? 'Cause

One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little child can find a toy
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little heart can find some joy

One little angel who was riding a star
Cried as she looked down at the tree
Oh, please Mr. Father tree wherever you are
May I give him the star you gave to me?
Then in the heavens came a voice from afar
A voice that was heard throughout the world
Go down, little angel girl, and give him your star
Tonight he'll light the world 'cause

One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see on Christmas day
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see on Christmas day
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those...

5 ContributorsHold On To Your Dream Lyrics
In life we have our pains and sorrows
Face mountains we think we can't climb
Not thinking there's always tomorrow
You feel like giving up
You say you're out of luck
But then you hear a voice in your mind
Telling you to

Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
'Til the day that life is said and done

This world is filled with peaks and valleys
With rivers we think we can't cross
Too busy keeping sorrows telling
You say you're at you're end
You say you never win
But then a light comes on in your mind telling you to

Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
Until the day that life is said and done

If you wanna hold on to something
You better hold on to your dreams
If you want to hold on to something
You better hold to your love
To your love

So if they try to burst your bubble
It's 'cause they have none of their own
And when you feel you are in trouble
Hold your head up high
And feel your heart inside
And know that you are never alone
Just as long as you

Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
Until the day that life is said and done
Hold on to your dream
'Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a mother to her child
Don't let anyone ever steal your dreams from you
Hold on to your dream
And do your best to always wear a smile

(I love you, papa)
Hold on to your dream

I was a lonely no one
Living in a vacuum as life's debris
Victimized as one whose self deprivation
Had made for my outer insecurity
I was a he ain't nothin'
Living in the slums of love's misery
Starving from the lack of sweet affection
Until you came to rescue me

My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Since you walk through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Now that love's touched my soul
All my lonely nights alone are through

I was a Mr. Lonely
Seeing only darkness in the bright of day
Blind even though my eyes were wide opened
But then your love sunshined my way

My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Since you walk through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Now that love's touched my soul
All my lonely nights alone are through
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry 

My life was without reason
Sinking in a hell that had no space or time
Falling to the burning pit of pain and sorrow
Until you saved this life of mine

My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Since you walk through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Now that love's touched my soul
All my lonely nights alone are through
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry 
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
My nights are not lonely no more
My tears don't flow no more
My eyes don't cry, my eyes don't cry, my eyes don't cry no more
