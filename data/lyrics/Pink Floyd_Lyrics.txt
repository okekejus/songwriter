"And disciplinary remains mercifully"
"Yes and um, I’m with you, Derek, this star nonsense"
"Yes, yes"
"Now which is it?"
"I am sure of it"

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?


How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb
Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb

*ticking clocks*
*clocks ringing*


Ticking away
The moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours
In an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground
In your hometown
Waiting for someone
Or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun


And you run, and you run
To catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
And racing around
To come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way
But you're older
Shorter of breath
And one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation
Is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody-good bullshit

I'm in the hi-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Learjet


Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie

Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun

Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

And every day the paperboy brings more

And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

The lunatic is in my head (*laughter*)
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You rearrange me 'till I'm sane
You lock the door and throw away the key
And there's someone in my head, but it's not me

And if the cloudbursts thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear (Oh, woah)
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes (Hey, hey, hey)

[Song 8: Hey You]
112 ContributorsTranslationsNederlandsEspañolHey You LyricsImmediately after finishing his wall, Pink begins to wonder (too little, too late) whether he’s made the right decision in completely isolating himself from the world.
Hey, you
Out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me?
Hey, you
Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me?
Hey, you, don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

Hey, you
Out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me?
Hey, you
With your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain


Hey, you
Out there on the road, always doing what you're told, can you help me?
Hey, you
Out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me?
Hey, you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

(We fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall...)

And after all, we're only ordinary men
Me, and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do

"Forward!" he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
The general sat, and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which, and who is who?
Up and down
And in the end, it's only round and round, and round

"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried
"Listen, son," said the man with the gun
"There's room for you inside"

"I mean, they're gonna kill ya
So like, if you give 'em a quick sh… short, sharp, shock
They don't do it again
Dig it? I mean, he got off light
'Cause I could've given him a thrashin'
I only hit him once!
It's only a difference in right and wrong, innit?
I mean good manners don't cost nothin', do they, eh?"

Down and out
It can't be helped, but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?

Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died

You shone like the Sun

Shine on, you crazy diamond

Like black holes in the sky

Shine on, you crazy diamond

You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon

Shine on, you crazy diamond

Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

Shine on (Shine on), you crazy diamond (You crazy diamond)

Well, you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine

Overhead, the albatross
Hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light
Strangers passing in the street
By chance, two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the Sun


Cloudless, every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
Call to you across the sky

You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
Gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
Got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
Then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in


Wah! *laughter*

You gotta keep one eye
Looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder, harder and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer


*dogs barking and howling*

And when you lose control
You'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight
You used to need to throw around
So have a good drown as you go down
All alone, dragged down by the stone

*dogs barking and howling*


Got to admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off
This creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground
How can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do
Would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer


Who was born in a house full of pain?
Who was trained not to spit in the fan?
Who was told what to do by the man?
Who was broken by trained personnel?
Who was fitted with collar and chain?
Who was given a pat on the back?
Who was breaking away from the pack? (Breaking away from the pack)
Who was only a stranger at home? (Only a stranger at home)
Who was ground down in the end? (Ground down in the end)
Who was found dead on the phone? (Found dead on the phone)
Who was dragged down by the stone?
Who was dragged down by the stone?

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude the flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world


Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

"Yeah?"
"Is that Charlie?"
"Yeah"

Let him get away with murder, let me hammer him today

Crazy, toys in the attic, I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away!
(Crazy, toys in the attic, he is crazy)
You little shit, you're in it now, I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often than you did, but no!
You had to go your own way
Have you broken any homes up lately?
Just five minutes, Worm your honour, him and me, alone

Babe!
Come to mother baby, let me hold you in my arms
M'lud I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honour, let me take him home

Crazy, over the rainbow, I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in
(Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy)

The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for the jury to retire
In all my years of judging, I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate
(Go on, Judge, shit on him!)
Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers
Tear down the wall!

Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!

Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!

*sheep bleating*

Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air

You better watch out
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen
Things are not what they seem

What do you get for pretending the danger's not real?
Meek and obedient, you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel

What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

(Stone, stone, stone…)


*sheep bleating*
The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives, He releaseth my soul
He madeth me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, He hath great power and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection and great dedication
Master the art of judo
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

Bleating and babbling, we fell on his neck with a scream
(Ahh! *laughter*)
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead
You better stay home and do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old


*sheep bleating*

[Song 25: Is There Anybody Out There?]
49 ContributorsTranslationsNederlandsPink Floyd - Is There Anybody Out There? (Traducción al Español)Is There Anybody Out There? LyricsIn questioning whether anybody is out there, Pink begins to realize the expansiveness of his wall and the consequences of his self-imposed reclusion.
The track would later name a live album of The Wall tour.
”Well, only got an hour of daylight left, better get started. Isn't it unsafe to travel at night? It'll be a lot less safe to stay here. Your father's gonna pick up our trail before long. Can Lorca ride? He'll have to ride. Lorca, time to go! Chengra, thank you for everything. Let's go. Goodbye, Chengra, Goodbye, Missy! I'll be back one day”

Pink Floyd! Pink Floyd!

Pink Floyd! Pink Floyd!
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
You better make your face up with your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door
You better run!
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run!

I've got electric light, and I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation

And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There will be nobody home

I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to

Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone
(“Surprise, surprise, surprise…”)
There's still nobody home

I've got a pair of Gohil's boots

Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone, as my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earthbound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought, I'd thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded, but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earthbound misfit, I
"Friction lock, set
Mixtures, rich
Propellers, fully forward
Flaps, set, ten degrees
Engine gauges and suction, check
Mixture set to maximum percent, recheck
Flight instruments
Altimeters, check both
Lights, on
Pitot heater, on
Strobes, on
Confirm 3-8 echo ready for departure
Hello again, this is now 129.4
129.4, it’s a go
3-8 echo cleared takeoff, the wind’s normal at ten knots
3-8 echo
Easy on the brakes, take it easy, it’s gonna roll this time
Just handle the power gradually, and it"

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds, I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earthbound misfit, I

Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock-and-roll refugee
Ooh, baby, set me free

"Eins, zwei, drei, alle!"
Ooh-ooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooh-ooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come (Worms to come)
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
Testing. One. Two. One. Two. The worms will convene at 1:15 outside Brixton Town Hall where we will be going in force!

(Waiting) To cut out the deadwood
(Waiting) To clean up the city
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To put on a black shirt
(Waiting) To weed out the weaklings
(Waiting) To smash in their windows and kick in their doors
(Waiting) For the final solution to strengthen the strain
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To turn on the showers and fire the ovens
(Waiting) For the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews
(Waiting) To follow the worms

Would you like to see Britannia rule again
(Would you like to see us rule again)
My friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again
(Would you like to send them home again)
My friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms
The Worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station, where we'll be moving along at about 12 o'clock down Stockwell Road
At that point, we'll be heading towards Lambeth Road, where we will walk calmly with resistance, leaving twelve minutes to three as we move along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge
Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge, we're in Westminister Borough area. It's quite possible that we may encounter some Jew boys all the way from 4, 5, and 6 on the way as we go
Now is the time to clean up the city, for this is the beginning! We need to secure our people! We can't stand around and let ourselves be robbed, maimed, and killed!
And when we make it to the Highclock Corner, I want you to spread out and find them!
Storm the halls, and then tear the walls and the doors! Break down the doors and hunt them where they are!
(Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer!)
Stop!

And nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade, tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened, this is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV? Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat? Would you like to learn to fly?
Would you? Would you like to see me try?
Ah, no!

Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon

Shine on, you crazy diamond

Threatenеd by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

Well, you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine

Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun

Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
Outside, the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime

I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life


I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight into the shining sun

Through the fish-eyed lens of tear-stained eyes
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide
If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall
Dial the combination, open the priest hole
And if I'm in I'll tell you (what's behind the wall)
*Shot* (Yahoo!)

There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream?

And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side,  what would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away and leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance as you whisper down the phone?
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?


Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down

Around the icy waters underground

I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like
It's got a basket, a bell that rings
And things to make it look good
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want thing

I've got a cloak, it's a bit of a joke
There’s a tear up the front
It's red and black, I've had it for months
If you think it could look good then I guess it should

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want thing

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house
I don't know why I call him Gerald
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want thing

I've got a clan of gingerbread men
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish, they're on the dish

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want thing

Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork
Let’s go into the other room and make them work

And brought me here instead dressed in red

Where do we go from here (What are you feeling?)

I was spending my time in the doldrums
I was caught in a cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralysed
I thought that everything else would just wait
While you are wasting your time on your enemies
Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
Like shadows into the night
To martyr yourself to caution
Is not gonna help at all
‘Cause there’ll be no safety in numbers
When the right one walks out of the door

"Ladies and gentlemen, the winner by a knockout!"

Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While the ivy grows over the door
So I open my door to my enemies
And I ask "Could we wipe the slate clean?"
But they tell me to please go fuck myself
You know you just can’t win

Hey you
Did you ever realize what you'd become?
And did you see
That it wasn't only me you were running from?
Did you know all the time but it
Never bothered you anyway?
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes


The rain fell slow
Down on all the roofs of uncertainty
I thought of you
And the years and all the sadness fell away from me
And did you know?

Play these strings 'til my fingers are raw?

You're so hard to please
What do you want from me?

Do you think that I know something you don’t know?
(What do you want from me?)
If I don’t promise you the answers, would you go?

Should I stand out in the rain?
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you?

I’m not the one you need
What do you want from me?

You can have anything you want
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water
Anything you want
You can own everything you see
Sell your soul for complete control
Is that really what you need?
You can lose yourself this night
See inside, there is nothing to hide
Turn and face the light

What do you want from me?

From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
“Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of others’ suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away”

It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all, we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night


No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It’s not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there’ll be
No more turning away?

If I go insane
Please don't put your wires in my brain

If I were a rule, I would bend
If I were a good man

If I were alone, I would cry
And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry
And if I go insane
Will you still let me join in with the game?

Or stay home by the fire, felled by desire
Stoking the flame
But we’re here for the ride

This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts

As the hours glide by

Gonna tap out the rhythm

Memories come rushing up to meet me now
But in the space between the heavens
And the corner of some foreign field

Goodbye, Max, Goodbye, Ma
After the service, when you’re walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air
You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream!

(“Oi!”) A place to stay, Enough to eat (“Over here, Morris! Get back! Get back, John!”)
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And what’s more, no-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don’t blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no one kills the children anymore
No one kills the children anymore
Night after night
Going round and round, my brain
His dream is driving me insane

In the corner of some foreign field
The gunner sleeps tonight
What’s done is done
We cannot just write off his final scene
Take heed of the dream
Take heed

Gives way and suddenly it's day again
The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset, hmph
Could be the human race is run

Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck ("Oh no!")
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear (*scream*)
And you'll never hear their voices ("Daddy, Daddy!")
And you'll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore

And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally, I understand
The feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds,  foe and friend
We were all equal in the end

Extinguished by light, I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile

I’m creeping back to life, my nervous system all awry
I’m wearing the inside out


Look at him now, he’s paler somehow
But he’s coming around
He’s starting to choke, it’s been so long since he spoke
Well, he can have the words right from my mouth

And with these words, I can see
Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name
Now we can hear ourselves again

I’m holding out (He’s standing on the threshold)
For the day (Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he’ll)

Was it you? Was it me?
Did I watch too much T.V.?
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?
If it wasn't for the Nips
Being so good at building ships
The yards would still be open on the Clyde
And it can't be much fun for them
Beneath the rising sun
With all their kids committing suicide
What have we done?
Maggie, what have we done?
What have we done to England?

Should we shout? Should we scream?
“What happened to the post war dream?”
Oh, Maggie, Maggie, what did we do?

Heaven sent the promised land
Looks alright from where I stand
'Cause I’m the man on the outside looking in
Waiting on the first step
Show me where the key is kept
Point me down the right line because it’s time

To let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there’s a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I’m growing old

Flash the readies
Wot’s the deal?
Got to make it to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turnin' of the wheel
Mile after mile (Mile after mile)
Stone after stone (Stone after stone)
Turn to speak but you’re alone
Million miles from home, you’re on your own

So let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there’s a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I’m growing old


Fire bright by candlelight
And her by my side
And if she prefers we never stir again
Someone sent the promised land
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now, I'm the man on the inside looking out

Hear me shout, “Come on in!"
"What’s the news and where ya been?”
'Cause there’s no wind left in my soul
And I’ve grown old

It was just before dawn one miserable morning in black Forty-Four
When the forward commander was told to sit tight, when he asked that his men be withdrawn
And the Generals gave thanks as the other ranks held back the enemy tanks for a while
And the Anzio bridgehead was held for the price of a few hundred ordinary lives

And kind old King George sent Mother a note when he heard that Father was gone
It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll with gold leaf and all
And I found it one day in a drawer of old photographs hidden away
And my eyes still grow damp to remember his Majesty signed with his own rubber stamp

It was dark all around, there was frost in the ground when the Tigers broke free
And no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers Company C
They were all left behind, most of them dead, the rest of them dying
And that's how the High Command took my daddy from me

People heard him say, say
"I will find a way, way
There will come a day, day

Then at last, the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall

Now, now, now
Is the time, time, time
To be, be, be aware

Carter’s father saw him there
And knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake

Oh, my
Something in my eye, eye
Something in the sky, sky
Waiting there for me

The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes was Lucy in the sky

Summoning his cosmic powers

As darkness falls and waves roll by
The seasons change, the wind is warm

Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields, a cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn


And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds
And I go down

Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And she’s breathing low

And I rise, like a bird
In the haze, when the first rays
Touch the sky
And the night winds die

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

Mrs. Thatcher, and Paisley (Hello Maggie!)
Mr. Brezhnev and party

The ghost of McCarthy,
And the memories of Nixon
And now, adding colour (Da questa parte)
A group of anonymous Latin-American meat packing glitterati
Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?

They can polish their medals and sharpen their smiles,
And abuse themselves playing games for a while
Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead


Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye
Their favourite toy
They’ll be good girls and boys
In the Fletcher Memorial
Home for Colonial
Wasters of Life and Limb
Is everyone in?
Are you having a nice time?

The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough


His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

(It's not enough, it's not enough)

And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

On the day the Wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high, we raised a cry
For freedom had arrived
And on the day the Wall came down
The ship of fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night
Like paper doves in flight

I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there’s a change that even with regret
Cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history
In shades of grey

I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitter residues slipped away
Slipped away

As I reach for a peach, slide a rind down behind
The sofa in San Tropez
Breakin' a stick with a brick on the sand
Ridin' a wave in the wake of an old sedan

Sleepin' alone in the drone of the darkness
Scratched by the sand that fell from my love
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her callin'
"If you're alone, I'll come ho-ho-home"

Backward and homebound, the pigeon, the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain, on an airplane
Born in a home with no silver spoon
I’m drinking champagne like a good tycoon

Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
I'll gather my far-flung thoughts together
Speeding away on the wind to a new day
If you're alone, I'll come ho-ho-home


And I pause for a while by a country stile
And listen to the things they say
Diggin' for gold in a hole in my hand
Open a book, take a look at the way things stand

And you're leading me down to the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice calling to me
Making a date for later by phone
And if you're alone, I'll come ho-ho-home

Her love rains down on me
It's easy as the breeze
I listen to her breathing
It sounds like the waves on the sea
I was thinkin' all about her
Burning wth rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness
And the earth was on fire

She could take it back
She might take it back someday

So I spy on her, I lie to her
I make promises I cannot keep
Then I hear her laughter rising
Rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me
I take all that I can take
And I push her to the limit
To see if she will break

She might take it back
She could take it back someday


Ring-a-ring o’ roses
A pocket full of posies
A-tishoo, a-tishoo
We all fall down

Now I have seen the warnings
Screaming from all sides
It’s easy to ignore them
God knows I’ve tried
All of this temptation
You know it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn’t see the danger
Or hear the risin' tide

She can take it back
She will take it back someday
She can take it back
She will take it back someday
She will take it back
She will take it back someday

You only have to read the lines
They’re scribbly black and everything shines

Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time

Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes, they did


For all the time spent in that room
The doll’s house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year

Have you time before you leave to greet another man?

You shout in your sleep
Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscience at rest
If once put to the test?
You awake with a start
To just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky
Just two ears, just two eyes

You set sail across the sea
Of long past thoughts and memories
Childhood’s end, your fantasies
Merge with harsh realities
And then as the sail is hoist
You find your eyes are growing moist
And all the fears never voiced
Say you have to make your final choice


Who are you and who am I
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die
Beneath one infinite sky
There’ll be war, there’ll be peace
But everything one day will cease
All the iron turned to rust
All the proud men turned to dust
And so all things, time will mend
So this song will end

But I can you

Lazing in the foggy dew (Ooh, hoo)
Sitting on a unicorn
No fair, you can't hear me
But I can you

Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion
Too much, I won't touch you
But then I might

Streaming through the starlit sky
Traveling by telephone
Hey, ho, here we go

Some bright-eyed and crazy, some frightened and lost

In derelict sidings the poppies entwine
With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?
(Closer, closer, closer, closer, closer, closer, closer)

She stood in the doorway, the ghost of a smile
Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign
Her cold eyes imploring the men in their Macs
For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs
Stepping up boldly one put out his hand
He said, “I was just a child then, now I’m only a man.”

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?
(Closer, closer, closer, closer, closer)


By the cold and religious we were taken in hand
Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad
(Tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray
Now our feelings run deep and cold as the clay)
Strung out behind us the banners and flags
Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags

You were caught on the cross fire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers, and I'll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph, and sail on the steel breeze
Come on, you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on, you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!

Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset

The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come
Thunder in the other course of heaven
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all

Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise

All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
For seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one

Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise, sunrise
Sunset, sunrise

In orange, red, and blue, he found it in the zoo
Dear, oh dear oh were they really sad for me?
Dear, oh dear oh will they really laugh at me?

Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?

He’s never been the same, no one is to blame

Store up leisure

[Song 106: One Slip]
35 ContributorsTranslationsNederlandsOne Slip Lyrics
A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look, and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend
“I will, I will” she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test

Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won’t forget
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight

Was it love or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life to a life
One regret, you will never forget
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight

One slip… one slip…

It’s high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

A butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side

Selling coloured photographs to magazines back home

And it’s high time, Cymbaline

Please, wake me

The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
Suddenly it strikes you that they’re moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don’t discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather round and haggle
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive
Even our Masters don’t know the webs we weave

One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world… One world

Invisible transfers and long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can’t stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have our dark side to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and they're gonna smash it down
One world… One world


One world… One world


The dogs of war don’t negotiate
The dogs of war won’t capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, you know they’ve been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain

One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we're gonna smash it down
One world… One world

One world… One world
One world… One world

And mice ran around on the ground

Though they’ll never fathom it, behind my sarcasm
Desperate memories lie

Sweetheart, sweetheart, are you fast asleep? Good
'Cause that’s the only time that I can really speak to you
And there is something that I’ve locked away
A memory that is too painful to withstand the light of day
And when we came back from the war

The memory smolders on
Of the gunner's dying words

Take a fresh grip on your bulletproof mask
And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions
(Hello Kenna, how are you tonight?)
You can hide, hide, hide
Behind paranoid eyes
You put on your brave face and slip over the road for a jar
Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world
With the boys in the crowd
You can hide, hide, hide
(I'll tell you what, I'll give you three blacks, and play you for five)
Behind petrified eyes
(Ta! You was unlucky there, son)
You believed in their stories of fame, fortune, and glory
Now you're lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high
And you hide, hide, hide
(Time gentleman!)
Behind brown and mild eyes
(Oi!)

They disembarked in '45 and no-one spoke and no one smiled
There were too many spaces in the line
Gathered at the cenotaph
All agreed with hand on heart to sheathe the sacrificial knives
But now she stands upon Southampton dock
With her handkerchief, and her summer frock
Clings to her wet body in the rain
In quiet desperation
Knuckles white upon the slippery rails
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again

And still the dark stain spreads between their shoulder blades
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves
And when the fight was over
We spent what they had made, but
In the bottom of our hearts, we felt the final cut

[Song 118: Questions for Assorted Lunatics]
8 ContributorsQuestions for Assorted Lunatics LyricsOn the 2011 Immersion Edition of Dark Side of the Moon, one of the bonuses is this handwritten note by Roger Waters, where he explains about the spoken tidbits featured on the album.“People often ask me about the voices on Dark Side. I was trying to gather audio snippets to mix into segues on Dark Side. Rather than interviewing people, I came up with the idea of writing a series of questions on cards. The cards would be in a stack on a conductors stand in front of a mike. We would scour Abbey Road Studios for willing guinea pigs, bring them to the studio, sit them down, roll tape and then ask them to respond to each card in order.
As I recall, the first card was something irrelevant and innocuous, like “What’s your favourite colour?” and the last was the more enigmatic “What do you think of The Dark Side Of The Moon?”
I can’t remember the ones in between, except for:
Are you afraid of dying?
When were you last violent?
Were you in the right?
Do you ever think you’re going mad?
If so why?
End of Story.”

One, two, free, four!

The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die

Life is a short, warm moment
And death is a long, cold rest
You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye
Eighty years, with luck, or even less

So all aboard for the American tour
And maybe you’ll make it to the top
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, ’cause I know
You may find it hard to get off


But you are the angel of death
And I am the dead man’s son
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole
And everyone is still on the run

And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?

The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die

Flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen
Beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room

One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?
A man who ran: a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

The use of force, he was so tough
She’ll soon submit, she’s had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He’s just the same as all the rest
He’s not the worst, and he’s not the best


And still, this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

19 ContributorsTranslationsNederlandsA New Machine (Part 1) Lyrics
I have always been here
I have always looked out from behind these eyes
It feels like more than a lifetime
Feels like more than a lifetime

Sometimes I get tired of the waiting
Sometimes I get tired of being in here
Is this the way that it's always been?
Could it ever have been different?

Do you ever get tired of the waiting?
Do you ever get tired of being in there?
Don't worry, nobody lives forever
Nobody lives forever

Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket
Feeling good at the top, shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town
Feeling very cool
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores

Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

Cornering neatly, she trips up sweetly
To meet the people, she's on time again, and then
I catch her by the eye, then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do cause I'm feeling very pink

Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

I love she
She loves me
See you
See you
See you

Oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

Thought you might like to know
I'm her lorry driver man, she's on the run
Down by the riverside, feeding ducks in the afternoon tide
(Quack, quack, quack, quack)

Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

[Song 136: Paintbox]
22 ContributorsTranslationsNederlandsPaintbox Lyrics
Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules, trying to impress
But feeling rather empty
I had another drink (A drink, a drink, a drink, a drink, a drink, ah)

What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game, they're in the scene
Oh, I should have been
Far away (Away, away, away, away, away)

Getting up, I feel so bad
Remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go
Out to a show, so what can I do?
I can’t think what to say
She sees through anyway (Away, away, away, away, away)

Out of the front door I go
Traffic’s moving rather slow
Arriving late, there she waits
Looking very angry
As cross as she can be (A-be, a-be, a-be, a-be, a-be)

Getting up, I feel so bad
Remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget it

Speech has allowed the communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible
Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking
Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future, with the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

[Song 139: Point Me at the Sky]
27 ContributorsTranslationsNederlandsPoint Me at the Sky Lyrics
Hey Eugene, this is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm thinking to say that I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me and hide with me, baby

Isn't it strange how little we change?
Isn't it sad, we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands and thousands…
Jumped into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand well back
He cried, "This is my last goodbye"

Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

And if you survive till 2005
I hope you're exceedingly fine
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe in…

People pressing on my sides
Is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate

Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

And all we've got to say to you is goodbye
Time gone by in the city when you whine, it's goodbye
You’re bringin’ Eugene, nobody scream, a goodbye
We can hang the pilot away, it’s goodbye
Time has long gone, goodbye
It’s your last chance, c’mon, say goodbye
Clang, clang, clang, clang, it’s a goodbye
The time, it’s flying by, it’s a goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, a goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, a goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Goodbye, it’s a goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
(Goodbye)

Help me roll away the stone

Come on you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!

Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy a candy and a currant bun
I like to see you running fast

Ooh, don't talk to me
Please, just fuck with me
Please, you know I'm feeling frail

It's you I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream tastes good in the afternoon
Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soon

Ooh, don't touch me child
Please, you know you drive me wild (Drive me wild)
Please, you know I'm feeling frail

Don't try another cat
I wouldn't go all odds on that
You must know I'm very, very, very frail

Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy a candy and a currant bun
I like to see you running fast

All is love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small

Waiting here seems like years
Never seen the light of day

All around I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear
Red the light and dark the night
I feel my dawn is near

Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Whisper low, here I go
I will see the sunshine show

I'm so afraid
Of all the mistakes that I've made
Shaking every time that I awake
I feel like a cardboard cut-out man

So build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the story line is kind

I've aged and aged since the first page
I've lived every line that you wrote
Take me down, take me down
From the shelf above your head

And build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the story line is kind


I live where I'm left
On the shelf like the rest
And the epilogue reads like a sad song
Please pick up your camera
And use me again

And build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the storyline is kind
Yeaaaah!
