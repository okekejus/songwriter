Come on

You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

A vision rolling round in my head, but I don’t really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don’t wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes

You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

Forty-eight hours of love, it's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
'Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
'Cause every second you’re away feels like forever

You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

Don’t have time to sleep, but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you were missing me
I’ll read between the lines and I sure hope it rains

Cole world (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Turn the overall volume up a lil bit, up a lil bit)
How's that? (Yeah, that’s nice)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (Need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (Need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep

I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this ends
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep

Can't stop, yeah (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
Can't stop (Just a lil more, now, just a lil more now) we ain’t gonna get no sleep (No sleep)

Sittin' over here, starin' in your face
With lust in my eyes, sure don't give a damn
And ya don't know that I've been dreamin'
Of ya in my fantasy
Never once you looked at me
Don't even realize that I'm wantin' you to fulfill my needs
Think what you want, let your mind free
Run free to a place no one dares to

How many nights I've laid in bed excited over you?
I've closed my eyes and thought of us a hundred different ways
I've gotten there so many times, I wonder how 'bout you
Day and night, night and day, all I've got to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl

Allow me some time to play with your mind
And you'll get there again and again
Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
Take your time 'cause we've got all night, ooh
You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs
And let me know what you like, if you like, I'll go
Down, da-down, down, down, da-down, down
I'll hold you in my hand and maybe

Your smooth and shiny feels so good against my lips, sugar
I want you so bad I can taste your love right now, baby
Day and night, night and day, all I've got to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl
If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl

I've laid in bed excited over you
One hundred different ways
I've thought of many, many
All I want to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl

I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to

But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl

I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but...

Sittin' here with my tears
All alone with my fears, I'm wondering
If I have to do without you
But there's no reason why
I fell asleep late last night
Cryin' like a newborn child
Holdin' myself close
Pretendin' my arms are yours
I want no one but you

I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but...

I still remember to the day
In fact it was a third Monday
You came along to be the one for me
And now I'm alone
I'm sittin' here by the phone
Call and say that you're okay
So that I have
The chance to beg you to stay
I want no one but you

I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but...

Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
You know that I know that I get so lonely thinking of you

I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me

All the lonely nights, I spend alone
Never 'round to love me, you're always gone
'Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules
Oh, the man has come lookin' for you
(You're a rebel now) Don't give a damn
(Always carrying on) With the gang
(I'm tryin' to tell you, boy) It's a mistake
(You won't realize) Till it's too late

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Livin' on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

You're so together, boy, but just at a glance
You'll do anything if given a chance
Scheming, planning lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep
(Don't you tell yourself) That it's okay
(Sick and tired of) All of your games
(And you want me to stay) Ah, better change
(Makes no sense to me) Your crazy ways

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Not afraid to die-ie-ie, guitar
Black cat
Black cat
Man, I don't understand your ways
Livin' on the edge

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Livin' on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die
Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Livin' on the edge, not afraid to die

Better watch your step or you're gonna die

I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me in my
Mind

"How can I be strong?" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions, you had many
I know you did
I've come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you
Ooh, it felt so good and
Ooh, so right

"How can I be strong?" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss
I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
I don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love me then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you
Again

[Song 22: What About]
21 ContributorsWhat About Lyrics
We walked along the beach, what a moonlit night
He held my hands in his, he kissed me, and he said
"I wanna spend my life with you, I want you for my wife"
Just then, I thought

What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me?
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you yelled at me?
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?

I took a pause, then a deep sigh
He looked right into my eyes, as he said
"I know I didn't say somethin' wrong"
I didn't have the courage to say, but then, I thought

What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me?
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you yelled at me?
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you hit my face?
What about the times you kept on when I said: "No more, please"
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you were ashamed me?
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her?
She only gave you head, uh
What about that, what about that?

Don't wanna live my life in misery
Don't tell me you did it 'cause you love me
I don't believe, I'm sick and tired of your deceptive games
Wonder where you have been, I can't live life wonderin'

My heart was poundin', but the time had come
To stop lettin' my whisperin' heart control me
Yeah, and tellin' my screamin' mind what to do (Yeah)
I looked him straight in the eyes and then I said

What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me?
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you yelled at me?
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you hit my face?
What about the times you kept on when I said
"No more, please"
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you were ashamed me?
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her?
She only gave you head (Oh)
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me? (I remember)
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that? (Oh)
What about the times you yelled at me? (I remember)
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me (You wouldn't even hold me)

Thought you'd get the money too
Greedy motherfuckers
Try to have their cake and eat it too
Son of a gun
Son of a gun
You're such a romantic hero
The way you dress and look yourself over
It's no wonder you would ponder that image
Of your preening self in the mirror
Go on

Sharpshooter into breakin' hearts
A baby gigolo, a sex pistol
Hollerin' at everything that walks
No substance, just small talk
Know why you're feelin' on that girl's behind
You got a sleazy, one track mind
Workin' your work until you think you find
Who's goin' home with you tonight?

Oh, who you gonna give it to?
Who you gonna steal it from?
Who's your next victim?
Oh, who you gonna lie to?
Who you gonna cheat on?
Who you gonna leave alone?
Oh, what you gonna tell her after she discovers
You don't really love her?
Oh, it's gonna be a showdown, knock down, drag out
Gun-slingin', shoot 'em up

I betcha think this song is about you

I betcha think this song is about you
Don't you, don't you, don't you?

Ha, ha, who, who
Thought you'd get the money too
Greedy motherfuckers
Try to have their cake and eat it too
Son of a gun
Son of a gun

You tell 'em, Carly
Clouds in my coffee
Go on
Clouds in my coffee

Ha, ha, who, who
Thought you'd get the money too
Greedy motherfuckers
Try to have their cake and eat it too

Sweatin' me but I'm not your type
You think you irkin' me and you're so right
I'd rather keep the trash and throw you out
Stupid bitch in my beach house
No, I ain't gonna go and act a fool
And be the lead story on the nigga news
Never me, sucker, I'd never be your lover
I'd rather make you suffer, you stupid motherfucker

Oh, who you gonna give it to?
Who you gonna steal it from?
Who's your next victim?

Thought you'd get the money too
Greedy motherfuckers
Try to have their cake and eat it too (Let's dance)

You tell 'em, Carly
Clouds of various shapes and sizes
Most guys like to evaluate their prizes
Alright now
We come with so many different tricks
The apricot scarf was worn by Nick
Nothing in the words refer to Mick

Got a chip upon your shoulder, I just knocked it off
Show me what you're gonna do, I ain't 'bout to run
You have just run out of ammunition
I'm storm cloud, baby
Shootin' blanks now, you son of a gun
You can roll like thunder all over me

Oh, who you gonna give it to?
Who you gonna steal it from?
Who's your next victim?
No, no, no, no, no
Oh, who you gonna lie to?
It's not what you say, its what you do
Who you gonna cheat on?
Who you gonna leave alone?
You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you
Oh, what you gonna tell her after she discovers
You don't really love her?
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you?
Oh, it's gonna be a showdown, knockdown, drag down
Gun slugger, shoot 'em up

I'm gone
Son of a gun
Go on
Janet and me, thick as thieves
Never met jet but I'll venture a bet
There's a common threat to our common dream
Tell 'em, Carly
And if it wasn't for that damned cream
There'd be no clouds in my coffee, clouds in my coffee
Ha ha ha ha ha
Who do you think you are, Rambo?
Or a cumulonimbus capillatus or a cirrus or an altostratus?
Somebody to make somebody like me proud
You tell 'em, Carly
In the encyclopedia of clouds?
Alright now
No no no no
It's not what you say, it's what you do
You're so vain
Go on
You probably think this song is about you
You tell 'em, Carly
You probably think this song is about you
Don't hurt him now
Yeah, you probably think this song is about you
That's my girl
Is about you
Go on
Is about you

You son of a gun

To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
We have a special need
To feel that we belong

This special need that's within us
Brings out the best, yet worst in us
Follow the passion that's within you
Living the truth will set you free

We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside (Come with me, come with me)
Inside my velvet rope
We have a special need (Have a special need)
To feel that we belong (To feel we, to feel we)
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope

Put others down to fill us up
Oppressing me will oppress you
Outside, leave judgment, outside, leave hate
One love's the answer you'll find in you

We have a special need (Have a special need)
To feel that we belong (Belong, belong)
Come with me inside (Come with me, come with me)
Inside my velvet rope


We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside

It’s just a part of growing
And never for a single moment
Did I ever go without your love
You made me feel wanted

Truth is, truth is that I wouldn’t be here
Without the love I stand on
Anytime I get lost in the world
You’ll always be there
To care and share
In the joy and the pain, oh
Our love won’t change

And what I share with you
Ever sacred, everlasting
The greatest love for me
I love you
And it’s pure
And it will endure
The world can’t break down
The connection
Cause our love is divine
And it’s unbreakable

Faithful love that I will always keep first
My heart will never be hurt
Family that walks through fire for me
So I don’t get burnt

To a love that’s true blue
I dedicate myself to you

You might think I'm crazy, but I'm serious
It's better you know now
What I thought was happiness was only part time bliss
You can take a bow
It was all just one big night out on the town
Riding in your limousine
We turned right and I said wrong which brings us to a stop
As the light is changing

Oh, my meters running, so I've got to go now
It's the pleasure principle, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
It's the principle of pleasure, oh-oh
It's the pleasure principle, oh-oh, oh-oh

It's true you want to build your life on guarantees
Hey, take a ride in a big yellow taxi
I'm not here to feed your insecurities
I wanted you to love me
This has become an all too familiar scene
It's not the first time I paid the fare
Where'd you get the idea of material possession?
Thank you for the ride, nowhere

And oh, my meters running, so I've really got to go
It's the pleasure principle, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-hoo
It's the principle of pleasure, oh-oh, ah
It's the pleasure principle oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, ah-ah

I know, what you mean to me

You know, what became between you and me
Human differential
Di-da, di, da-da

Here I am in your face
Tellin' truths and not your old lies
Seems to me that you care
And I know that you're runnin' out of time
See, you can't get away
I'll be here forever and again
Whisperin' in your ear
Do believe 'cause you know you cannot win

Spent most your life pretending not to be
The one you are but who you choose to see
Learned to survive in your fictitious world
Does what they think of you determine your worth?
If special's what you feel when you're with them
Taken away, you feel "less than" again
(That's right)

You gotta mean what you say
You gotta say what you mean
Tryin' to please everyone
Sacrifice your own needs
Check in the mirror, my friend
No lies will be told then
Pointin' the finger again
You can't blame nobody but you
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta say what you mean
Tryin' to please everyone
Sacrifice your own needs
Check in the mirror, my friend
No lies will be told then
Pointin' the finger again
You can't blame nobody but you

There's a feeling inside
No, you cannot change it right away
Gotta make a try
And with time, it'll start to go away
I'll be here when you need
That one to sit and cry to
'Cause I'm the you you forgot
The only one you know you cannot lie to

Bitter you'll be if you don't change your ways
When you hate you, you hate everyone that day
Unleash this scared child that you've grown into
You cannot run for you can't hide from you
Can't hide from you (That's right)

You gotta mean what you say
You gotta say what you mean
Tryin' to please everyone

And squeeze me
And you leave me making me blue

Do you really like him that much?"
"Yes honey, I love him, he is fun
He does a lot of nice things for me"
I know he used to do nice stuff for you
But what has he done for you lately?

Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to brag about it all the time
Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen
But my friends say neglect is on your mind
Who's right?

What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death
Ain't that a shame?

What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

I never ask for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this Earth
I'm telling you, no way
You ought to be thankful for the little things
But little things are all you seem to give
You're always putting off what we can do today
Soap opera says, you've got one life to live

Yeah, c'mon

You're missing me, I'm missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain't gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It's fait accompli, we ain't gonna get no sleep

A vision rolling round in my head
But I don't really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don't wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes

You're missing me, I'm missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain't gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It's fait accompli, we ain't gonna get no sleep

Forty-eight hours of love, it's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
'Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
'Cause every second you’re away feels like forever

You're missing me, I'm missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain't gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It's fait accompli, we ain't gonna get no sleep
You're missing me, I'm missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain't gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It's fait accompli, we ain't gonna get no sleep

Don't have time to sleep but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you are missing me
I'll read between the lines
And I sure hope it rains
Yeah…

Looking through my old drawer
Came across the letter you wrote
Said you needed time away
That was so long ago

All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go

Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me

Lord knows that I have tried
To live my life as one
Friends tell me to hold on
Tough times don't last for long

My abandoned heart
Just doesn't understand
My undying love for you
Won't let me wait

Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me
I want you to

There we go

I've seen the world, been to many places
Made lots of friends, many different races
I've had such fun around the world it's true
African skies with a Nairobi mood
I fell asleep in Tuscany and dreamed
The one thing missing was you

Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

I woke up with an Australian breeze
And danced the dance with Aborigines
Oh, under the moon glow, down in Mexico
I dreamed, one thing was missing that's you

Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

We'll sail the waters of many colors
Won't need no compass, love will guide our way
Don't need nobody, long as we got each other
No need to hurry, we've got everyday
I want to share the world with you, you see
Springtime in Paris feels so good to me
Oh, this is for me reality, so please
Make all my wishes come true

Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

And I just know we'll have a good time, yeah

Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

Remember that special night?
When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor
To stay together

We made our very first promise
To love, to share
And be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love can be greater

You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing too
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because I'll never give up on you

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
You know you can't rush love

Let's wait awhile (Ooh, ooh)
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile (Wait awhile)
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far (Far, far, oh)
Let's wait awhile (Let's just take our time)
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile (Love's so good)
Sure our love will be there
Let's wait awhile (Slow it down)
Before we go too far

I promise
I'll be worth the wait

(One, two, one, two, three, four)

How could it be that you knew me?
My deepest fears, my fantasies?
Confide in you what no one knows
But it feels so real
(One, two, three, four)

(When I close my eyes) I can see your face
(When I lick my lips) I can taste your smile
(When I see your name) My heart starts to race
(If I can't read your thoughts) Then I feel empty

(When I close my eyes) I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) Woah, I feel empty
(When I close my eyes)

Is this a new way to love?
Never face-to-face, is it enough?
Does it really count or am I a fool?
So tell me, please, am I wasting my time?
Your phrases, descriptive
And through the textured words
With beauty, you post it
And use such colored verbs
We've never met, ooh (One, two, three, four)

(When I close my eyes) I can see your face
(When I lick my lips) I can taste your smile
(When I see your name) My heart starts to race
(If I can't read your thoughts) Then I feel empty

(When I close my eyes) I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) Woah, I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) Empty
(When I close my eyes)

Rushin' home to turn you on
Sometimes you're there, sometimes you're gone (One, two, three, four)
Wait for hours for your return
So tell me, please, am I wasting my time?
Your phrases, descriptive
And through the textured words
With beauty, you post it
And use such colored verbs (One, two, three, four)
So tell me, you think that maybe we've gone insane?
To find a, a lover and through the words of pain (One, two, three, four)
We've never met, ooh (One, two, one, two, three, four)

(When I close my eyes) I can see your face
(When I lick my lips) I can taste your smile
(When I see your name) My heart starts to race
(If I can't read your thoughts) Then I feel empty

I feel empty
Woah, I feel empty
So empty
(One, two, three, four)
When I lick my lips (When I close my eyes)
I can taste your smile (When I close my eyes)
My heart starts to race (When I close my eyes)
I can taste your smile (When I close my eyes)

(One, two, three, four)
(One, two, three, four)

(When I close my eyes) I can see your face
(When I lick my lips) I can taste your smile
(When I see your name) My heart starts to race
(If I can't read your thoughts) Then I feel empty

(When I close my eyes) I feel empty
(When I close my eyes) I feel empty

They've all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together

There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love would never do without you

Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy, it's you I can't do without

I feel better when I have you near me
'Cause no other love around
Has quite the same, ooh-ooh
Like you do, do, do, do, babe

They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love would never do without you
Do without you
Love would never do without you
Woo!
Do without you

Ah
Ooh, ooh, go on
Love would never do (Fine)
Never do without you (Oh, yeah)
Love would never do (Fine)
Never do without you (Ooh, for me)
Love would never do (Fine)

Love will never do (Never do)
Love will never do without you (Ooh)
Love will never do
Love will never do without you (Ooh)
Love will never do (Ooh-ooh)
Love will never do without you
Baby, yeah

What?
They said it, they said it wouldn't last
They said it, they said it wouldn't last (Woo!)
They said it, they said it wouldn't (Hey, what do you want?)
They said it wouldn't last (If you believe in love, say)
Love will never do
Love will never do without you
Love will never do
Love will never do without you

They said it wouldn't last (Last)
We had to prove them wrong (Wrong)
'Cause I've learned in the past (Won't do, won't do)
That love would never do without you (Just won't do without you)
We had to prove them wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past (Ooh, won't do, won't do)
That love would never do without you (Just won't do without you)
We had to prove them wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love would never do without, do without, you
They said it
They said it

You could have gone from door to door
But you knew just where to go to
Come into my velvet rope and tell me fantasies

The passion in your voice I wanna hear as you start to tell me
While you're at it, take the blindfold, tie it gently on me
Don't wanna see but feel the things you're gonna do to me

I'm afraid, I'm starting to feel
What I said I would not do
The last time really hurt me

I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last

But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
My heart does begin to race every time

One half wants me to go
Other half wants me to stay
I just get so all confused

I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last

But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time
My heart does begin to race every time

I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last

But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
My heart does begin to race every time
It's every time
It's every time
'Cause every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear

The fear does start to erase every time
Oh could it be that this will be the one that lasts

Not too pleased with what you're diggin'
I'm just busy livin' my life
"Sources say," but where ya gettin' it?
Don't create the truth you like

It might sound strange to you
But what you think it don't mean nothing at all
Doesn't change who I am
Doesn't change who I love

Living my life
The way that I hope
Is leading me to
The great forever
Forever I will choose
Watch what I'm doing
Watch where I'm going
Tryin' to get to
The great forever
Forever is the truth

If you wrong, would you admit it
And take the heat up under the lights? Yeah
Use your expert criticism
Then maybe you could get a life
Don't like seeing people happy
Is it jealousy or personal? Yeah
'Cause I don't see why loving someone
Or what I do seem so radical to you

Still it might sound strange to you
But what you think, it don't mean nothing at all
(Doesn't change) Doesn't change who I am
(Doesn't change) Doesn't change who I love

Living my life
The way that I hope
Is leading me to
The great forever
Forever I will choose
Watch what I'm doing
Watch where I'm going
Tryin' to get to
The great forever
Forever is the truth

Once you know why you're here
It becomes crystal clear
To love someone is divine
That empty hole in your heart
It will tear you apart
Because hate will only divide (Ah-choo)
(Bless you)

Hey hey hey hey
Nah nah nah nah nah
Hey
Nah nah
It's sad when you take such a beautiful thing
Blow it up and call it the news
It's not ok still I hope that one day
You'll find the great forever too
(L.U.T.F.A.)

Living my life
The way that I hope
Is leading me to
The great forever
Forever I will choose
Watch what I'm doing
Watch where I'm going
Tryin' to get to
The great forever
Forever is the truth
Living my life
The way that I hope
Is leading me to
The great forever
The great forever
The great forever
Watch what I'm doing
Watch where I'm going
Tryin' to get to
The great forever
Forever is the truth
Forever is the truth
Forever

Tryin' to get to

Todos necesitamos
Un amigo en la soledad

Feeling so alone and deserted
With people standing all around you
Should I trust someone?
Should I stay off to myself?
Alone with no one to talk to
It's such a helpless feeling

So any time you feel the need, call me when you're lonely
'Cause everybody needs a friend to be there when you're lonely

So don't isolate yourself every time that I come around, yeah
A person all alone is an unhappy one
We need somebody near to love us
Someone who cares

Living life all by yourselve's impossible to do
And I'll be there for you

'Cause everybody needs a friend, and I'll be yours, if you're lonely
If you're lonely

If you're all alone and a friend you need
Like a river flows you hurt, I'll bleed
If you trust in me, we can find a way
Take away the pain, time heals all things
Even a lonely state of mind 'cause happiness is, oh, so hard to find
If you're lonely, I will be there
When you call for me, be there for you

So anytime you feel the need, call me when you're lonely
I will be there for you, be there with you, baby, any time you need me, call me
Call me, call me, call me
'Cause everybody needs a friend to be there when they're lonely

You can call on me, yeah, never let you down
Never let you down
Never let you down, yeah, yeah

So anytime you feel the need, call me when you're lonely
Hold you tight, be there always through the night
Mhmm, if you're all alone and a friend in need, I'll
Be there for you, be there for you, aw, baby, aw, baby
If you're all alone and a friend, you need, like a river flows you hurt, I'll bleed
If you trust in me, we can find a way
Take away the pain, time heals all things
Even a lonely state of mind, 'cause happiness is, oh, so hard to find

Te quiero tanto

Insight to what's going on
Information keeps us strong
What you don't know can hurt you bad
Take it from me, you'll be walkin' around sad
Cryin' for a better day
Until you educate for a better way
So if you wanna be in control
You gotta get yourself in the know

Get the knowledge
That you really want
The knowledge
Do you really want?
It's the knowledge
What you really want
The knowledge
That you really want

Spreading vice, don't believe the hype
You don't find the knowledge in a pipe
Too many lives go up in smoke
It's nice to laugh but don't be the joke
To get over, get better
I try to be the possessor
Of the one thing we all need in life
To succeed take my advice

And get the knowledge (Knowledge)
That you really want

If we're gonna change the way the world is run
The way to start is to rid the children of
Prejudice and ignorance (One, two)
We've gotta teach our kids to read and write
That's the only way to win the fight for life
Education is the goal so
If you wanna be in the know

[Song 55: Trust a Try]
17 ContributorsTrust a Try Lyrics
Trust: not an easy thing, you say
Never thought the game of love
This way you'd play
By the things you do
Never thought these things
I would go through with you
Pain, trickery, and deceit
All the wrongs that you put me through
If you don't wanna say
Still love you anyway
Never do believe my words
When I try telling you my story
Have no reason, still don't trust me
No, I'm not a cheat or liar

She brought love
She brought joy
She brought what she brought
You thought you'd never see again
She cheats and lied
Made you cry, said goodbye
Bodies numb, think you're never gonna feel again
Then what you do know? You take it slow
Here comes Jo, things go smooth
But dreams just around the bend
Don't blame me for jealousies or insecurities
Please see, 'cause I wouldn't do that to you

Don't smother me with misery (This place is just killing me!)
(Don't smother me with your pain and misery, baby, please quit)
Accusing me of polygamy (I feel I'm suffocating!)
(Accusing me of all this polygamy, oh, can't you see if-)
If not the trust, then we have what? (It's too for me!)
(Not the trust, baby, then we have what? Oh, nothin'. 'Gotta-)
Gotta be strong, oh keep holding on
(Be strong for me, please and keep holdin' on, oh, baby)

Wanna second chance with this love
This romance
Wanna make it last
Forget your past
She hurt you bad
Let's start anew
Yes, that means me and you
Gonna make it through
But you must give trust a try
Gotta be strong
With this love, hold on
Gotta trust in me
And we will see true victory
We'll love with ease
Baby, please trust in me
It'll be heavenly
But you must give trust a try

You got burned
You got bruised
You got
So you got a kick outta that
Unhealthy shit
You said to she
You'd please her needs
Whatever it'd be
Still, she'd cheat
On her back again for the money
Now leave from it
You grow from it
Get over it
I won't take the blame
So don't
'Cause I ain't having it
'Stead of givin' me
The third degree
That's so mean
Don't push me out the door
I wouldn't do that to you

Don't smother me with misery
(Don't smother me with your pain and misery, baby, please quit)
Accusing me of polygamy
(Accusing me of all this polygamy, oh, can't you see if-)
If not the trust, then we have what?
(Not the trust, baby, then we have what? Oh, nothin', 'gotta-)
Gotta be strong, oh, keep holding on

Wanna second chance with this love
This romance
Wanna make it last
Forget your past
She hurt you bad
Let's start anew
Yes, that means me and you
Gonna make it through
But you must give trust a try
Gotta be strong (Strong)
With this love, hold on
Gotta trust in me
And we will see true victory
We'll love with ease
Baby, please trust in me
It'll be heavenly
But you must give trust a try

Trust - ain't an easy thing, you say
Never thought the game of love
This way you'd play
By the things you do
Never thought these things
I would go through with you
Pain, trickery and deceit
All the wrongs that you put me through
Even though I must say
Still love you anyway
Never do believe my words
When I try telling you my story
Have no reason, still don't trust me
No, I'm not a cheat or liar

....with misery
Accusing me
Of polygamy
If not the trust
Then we have what?
Gotta be strong
Oh, keep holding on

Wanna second chance with this love
This romance
Wanna make it last
Forget your past
She hurt you bad
Let's start anew
Yes, that means me and you
Gonna make it through
But you must give trust a try

Feels like I'm goin' in circles
You're like a maze I can't get through
Should I go left? Should I go right?
Should I let you stay for the night?
It's like a seesaw when it comes to your love
Boy, when you're up, this girl is down
And I just can't figure it out

'Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
These tears - can you wipe 'em?
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me

I'm goin' out with guys I don't wanna go
To places that I've been before
They pitchin' the same game
Boy, it's a damn shame
How I wish it was you callin' me
I want it to be you holdin' me
Boy, it needs to be you kissin' me
'Cause it's like a seesaw, when it comes to your love
Boy, when you're up, this girl is down
And I just can't figure it out

'Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
These tears - can you wipe 'em?
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me

Listen
Have your way with me anytime, anywhere
Have your way however, I don't care
Have your way with me
And you can have it tonight
Tonight, tonight, boy, tonight

'Cause you know that I want you
And you know that I need you
Is that any way to be?
Just have your way with me
My body is cryin'
These tears - can you wipe 'em?

A baby girl without a home
Tragedy's reign left her alone
I guess I shoulda known better
But she's a citizen of the world
A right to life, her cry's unheard
I guess I shoulda known better
Why, why, why, why?

Part of the revolution
Ready for real solutions
We won't accept excuses
We tolerate no abuses
'Cause I don't want my face to be
That poster child for being naive
Why, why, why, why?
I guess I shoulda known better

Headlines are real or just the news
Between the lines there's human truth
I guess I shoulda known better
Each day I'm faced with irony but
Just can't feel casual about casualties no
I guess I shoulda known better
I guess I shoulda known better
Why, why, why, why?

Part of the revolution
Ready for real solutions
We won't accept excuses
We tolerate no abuses
'Cause I don't want my face to be
That poster child for being naive
Why, why, why, why?
I guess I shoulda known better

It's never the critic that counts
Cause critics only wanna talk
While enlightened minds and open hearts
Together make this world a better place

Awakening a better choice
It only starts if you lift your voice
And say I shoulda known better
And so next time I'll know better
Why, why, why, why?

Part of the revolution
Ready for real solutions
We won't accept excuses
We tolerate no abuses
Cause I don't want my face to be
That poster child for being naive
Why, why, why, why?
I guess I shoulda known better
Why, why, why, why?
I guess I shoulda known better

I had this great epiphany
And rhythm nation was the dream
I guess next time I'll know better

[Song 59: New Agenda]
10 ContributorsNew Agenda Lyrics
It ain't nothin' but an us thang
And it's time for us to step it up and respect
That level of sisterhood
That's been holding up our neighborhood
And if it wasn't for our mothers, there would be no brothers
And if it wasn't for our sisters, there would be no misters
So it ain't nothin' but a us thang
She's strong and that's a fact
Now it's time for us to take up the slack
Step it up, step it up, time to go to work

History hidden from me
To hide my identity
So I'd never feel
I am somebody
You've gouged my eyes
I see more clearly
You've tried to rob
My humanity
My spirit you tried to break
My soul you tried to take
There's no need to be afraid
'Cause I won't do unto you now

Amen
All that we've been through
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due
Amen
It's time to know the truth
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due

Time to step it up, step it up, better check yourself
I get vexed to protect what we got left

(No, no) Because of my gender
(No) I've heard no too many times
Because of my race
I've heard no too many times
(No, no) But with every no
I grow in strength, that is why
African-American woman
I stand tall with pride
You want to know what it takes
To rid yourself of me now
There's nothing you can do
Accept me for who I am now

Amen
All that we've been through
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due

Check it out, check it out, gotta check it out
It's a new thang, check it out, come on with it now
Time to step it up, come on (Hey), step it up

Amen
All that we've been through
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due
Amen
It's time to know the truth
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due

Step it up, step it up, it's time to step it up
Step it up, check it out, come on

Time to step it up, step it up, better check yourself
I get vexed to protect what we got left
Alone, lookin' for your own, here it is
I know what they're sayin', but the plan ain't playin' at the rank
Gotta step with us, us to discuss, a must
It ain't nothin' but an us thang
Rewind back to the time
Where the color of a mother had 'em call it a crime, brother
What in the world and the world says where is
The Black man's support of the woman and children?
Time to step it up, step it up, it's playoff time
And the rhyme go to check, so check yourself

Amen (Time to step it up, step it up)
A new agenda's due (Here we go)

Amen
All that we've been through
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due

It's time to know the truth
Our time has come to rejoice

Can't get enough of you
When we ooh

Hello my love
Wish you were here
So many things in my heart
That I'd like to share
A few warm thoughts
A subtle smile
Our conversation through silence
Could last all night

At ease my mind
To see your face
Those sexy eyes could calm
My heart of rage
You speak my name
I touch your-
The chemistry only true love could understand

You've opened my soul to happiness
And shown me new ways of love
Smooth is life's travels with you beside me
I'll never walk alone

Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
Can't get enough of you

You can give you
All you can give
You've taught me love, life
You taught me to live
At rainbow's end
That pot of gold
Can't hold a light to you
'Cause you're my heart and soul

Such passionate love, the love we make
In tune, our bodies are one
When loving's done, the passion's still strong
'Cause spiritually we are one

Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
Can't get enough of you
When I ooh
Can't get enough of you
When we ooh
Can't get enough of you

In tune, our bodies are one

Hey, J
It's been a long time since I've seen you last
A half and twenty-six years (My, time is fast)
I'm well
Though I've gone through some deep changes in my life
It hasn't been easy
Oh, no, not for me
It's been difficult at times
Sometimes, I sit down and cry
And ask God, "Oh, why?"
(Fair, what is?)

I know how you're feelin'
Same thing I did deal with
You're not as alone as you may feel
You see, but, oh
It catches up to us fast
We have to deal with the past
I know it's painful, but
There, you'll find specialness
'Cause everybody needs to feel real special

We need to remember
That love lies deep within ourselves
We have to want it so
It starts with us and no one else
We must learn we're all born
With specialness inside of us
I have the need to feel real special, too

(You see, you can't run away from your pain)
(Because, wherever you run, there you will be)
(You have to learn to water your spiritual garden)
(Then you will be free)

I know how you're feelin'
Same thing I did deal with
You're not as alone as you may feel
You see, but, oh
It catches up to us fast
We have to deal with the past
I know it's painful, but
There, you'll find specialness
'Cause everybody needs to feel real special

We need to remember

It starts with us and no one else
We must learn we're all born
With specialness inside of us
I have the need to feel real special, too

It was a long long time ago
But I remember it like yesterday
Amazing times while we were growing
Round all the brightest stars the world had seen
We made-up songs to do our chores to
And harmonized while we all did our part
Danced and sang our way through most anything
Always felt safe in each others' love

It was in summer that you left me
The fall and winter never felt so cold
And Lord knows words can never express it
Life feels so empty I miss you much
Painful tears like never before
We can't laugh together 'til we cry
But our love ain't no material thing
Inshaallah, see you in the next life

Broken hearts heal
Stronger
Broken hearts last
Longer
Broken hearts heal
Stronger
Ooh, ooh, ooh
La da da da la la
La da da da la la
La da da da la la
La da da da la la

But our love ain't no material thing
Inshaallah, see you in the next life
It was a long long time ago
But yet it seems like just yesterday
Such amazing times while growing up
Always felt safe in each others' love
It was a long long time ago
The fall and winter felt so cold
But our love ain't no material thing

Across the other side of bliss
Proof that Heaven does exist
I'm offering my gratitude
For what is meant to be
Is 'bout to break thru

Love is taking over
Like a tidal wave
Our universe is aligned
Feeling the love tonight
Love is taking over
Showing us the way
Darkness starts to fade
After the love tonight

I woke up in Heaven in the morning
With the biggest smile upon my face

Way beyond the highest high
Feel love pumping thru your body
Gonna redefine our attitudes
Like you better be good to me
And I better be good to you

Love is taking over
Like a tidal wave
Our universe is aligned
Feeling the love tonight
Love is taking over
Showing us the way
Darkness starts to fade
After the love tonight

Uh, I go by the name Kanye Omari
And I wrote this just to say I'm sorry
I have foreign cars and houses
I have porno stars and spouses
You tryin' to stab one like Jack the Ripper
I was tryin' to stab two like Jack the Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home, he from the street
He gon' want him some strippers
And I'm a big tipper, I don't need to be trippin'
This my first real Rolex, it don't even be tickin'
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without them clouding up in half an hour
So that basically mean my paper gettin' mean
(Uh) Basically mean I'm into better things
I was an addict of cheating, but I stopped for sure
You an addict, you go with Janet Jackson, you cured

(Baby) Don't matter what they say, baby (Baby)

Friday morning and all my work is done
I've packed my bags, I'm on the run
I got a feeling that I'm gonna have some
Fun in the sun with my friends
And he's got me going

Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Whoops now, sorry I can't go

Sorry I can't go, sorry I can't go now

Friday noon and my boss is on the phone
He's telling me that I can't leave home
An extra hand at work is what he called for
He said we need you here
Tell my friends I'm going

Whoops now, sorry I can't go

It makes no difference if you love work or not
If you dream of your weekend, hand on the doorknob
Out with your friends and fun in the sun
Now that's when the phone rings

Friday evening and I'm all alone at home
I bet my friends are having fun
I'll plan my weekend, dammit, leave the machine on
Next time he calls he'll hear my voice saying loud and clear

Whoops now, sorry I can't go

5 a.m. rise and shine
To feed the baby before he starts to cry
No rest and time to play
Fifteen, the mother is a runaway
No time for dreams or goals
Pressure is so strong
Her body she has sold
So her child can eat

What is happenin' to this world we live in
In our home and other lands?

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world
Ooh, baby

Lil' Johnny, all alone
His only friend, the doll he carries with him
Goes to school each and every day
To be teased because he has no place to stay
This young homeless boy, feels his life is worthless
Instead of suicide he cries himself to sleep

And it's happenin' to this world we live in
There's got to be a better way, ooh-ooh

I know that it's not been easy tryin' to make it in this crazy world
The people 'round you try to stop you
Stomp you, sayin' that you don't belong

And can't be stopped (Can't be stopped)
Stay strong, my sister, you can't be stopped

Beat you whenever you can't go on

You were born with blood of kings and queens
And can't be stopped (Can't be stopped)
Stand tall, my brother

And my body is in overdrive, dying to have you inside of me, baby

I'll go head to toe
And whenever you pursue it
You'll never hear the word "no"

Anytime you want me to

Get me so excited

For some girls it's 'bout mind control
They don't wanna give dude their props
But as for me, I'ma let you know that my body's smoking hot
(From when you) Throw me up against whatever's close
And get to bossin' me around
And every time I give you the assist
You know how to slam it down

If you like it, then I'll do it
I'll go head to toe
And whenever you pursue it
You'll never hear the word "no"
So, forget about them little girls, baby
'Cause now you're dealin' with a woman, baby, and

[Song 73: Livin’ in a World (They Didn’t Make)]
11 ContributorsLivin’ in a World (They Didn’t Make) Lyrics
Children are called the future
Of an adult world
They are born with spirits so innocent
Till we teach them how to hate
Add to the world's confusion
We teach our kids rules
That we don't adhere to ourselves
Right or wrong, what examples can they take?
The people we learn from, forge the ideas we become

Livin' in a world they didn't make
Livin' in a world that's filled with hate
Livin' in a world where grown-ups break the rules (And they're just)
Livin' in a world they didn't make
Payin' for a lot of adult mistakes
How much of this madness can they take, our children?

Children grow to become our young adults
Problems of the world
They must learn how to confront
Doin' drugs, joinin' gangs to rebel
Colors show they belong
To the social override
'Cause they're livin' in a space
They feel out of place

Livin' in a world they didn't make
Livin' in a world that's filled with hate
Livin' in a world where grown-ups break the rules (And they're just)
Livin' in a world they didn't make
Payin' for a lot of adult mistakes
How much of this madness can they take, our children? (How much can they take?)
Livin' in a world they didn't make (They did not make)
Livin' in a world that's filled with hate (That's filled with hate)
Livin' in a world where grown-ups break the rules (They're just)
Livin' in a world they didn't make (Livin' in a world)
Payin' for a lot of adult mistakes (Livin' in a world)
How much of this madness can they take, our children? (Livin' in a world)

How much can they take?
Children of the world
They are born so innocent
How much can they take?
Livin' in a world they didn't make (How much they can take) (Save the babies)
Payin' for a lot of adult mistakes (Save the babies)
How much of this madness can they take-

This just in
At least five people are dead, and thirty others wounded
After a gunman opened fire at a California school playground
And then killed himself
Apparently, the gunman, armed with an automatic rifle, shot the kids' door

How did I get here?
Think I know what I did
Always worked real hard
Maybe I missed something
I'm not into pointing fingers
Showing who's right or wrong
I just wanna keep it real
'Cause maybe I was doin' fine on my own

Listen, I had a career before, now didn't I?
I had lots of friends before, now didn't I?
And I had my fans before, now didn't I?
And I had my family before, now didn't I?
Guess without you
My little life was nothing
But don't sweat it

Arguing ain't necessary 'cause
We both have our whole lives left to live
We're both consumed with jealousy
But the truth can set you free

Ooh child, things will be bright 'cause
Truth will set you free

Conversation's deep
When you talk to yourself
There's no way to cheat
'Cause you know you can't be no one else
Won't trip out on disappointment
'Cause failure is just not me
Still I gotta do my job
'Cause you know my show can't go on without me

Listen, I had a career before, now didn't I?
Sold out around the world before, now didn't I?
I had a few hits before, now didn't I?
And danced until my feet were sore, now didn't I?
Guess without you
Oh, my little life was nothing
But don't sweat it
Let's say we disagree so
Arguing ain't necessary 'cause
We both have our whole lives left to live

It's sad to think we couldn't work it out but
How much is enough to pay for this mistake?
Hope your love was sincere

(Once you know
You can't not know)

Do you know about the black eagle?
Let me tell you about the black eagle
Strong and powerful king of the sky
Protecting all things with his watchful eyes
Faithful creature to the most high
What are the visions that he holds

You never know
Unless you've been there
You never know
Unless you've been there

Beautiful soul I haven't met
A spiritual connection I'll never forget
Your precious life
Incredible
Sharing his love that is meant for us all
Come outtta the shadows into the light
Free to imagine the future you like
Soaring above all of your boundaries
Yes the day will come
Just remember when you're overwhelmed
Dream and take some time to love yourself
Believe you're free to do whatever you want
No, no more room number four

You never know
Unless you've been there

I'm singing this love song to show my support
To the beautiful people who have been ignored
With blind eyes and cold shoulders attacking them
Invisible people they won't let fit in
Let's open our eyes to the true barriers
Stereotypical things are the worst
Stand face to face with the real ugly truth
How would you feel if that was you?
Because every life matters
(We all need to do better)
So we all should try
(We all need to do better)
A smile
A kind word
Or extending a hand
Helping someone to feel human again
If we never start
It could be you on the other end

You never know
(We all need to do better)
You never know
(We all need to do better)
You never know
No no
You never know

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I took myself on to the doctor, wasn't feelin' fine
I had a fever 104, oh, that blew my mind
Must be I had enough, 'bout to explode from the gossip, I said
Oh, my friend had my back just to stab, oh, yeah
Hurts so bad when I talk, wanna take something
Numb the pain, I know it ain't right
Come face to face with her
I gotta tell her how I feel inside

Ooh hoo, you ain't right
Ooh hoo, sick and tired
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The doctor said he'd give me something and I'd be alright
I still feel queasy, feel uneasy, no more drugs for me
Friendships I cherish, oh, let very few in the circle, I said
These walls I don't let down, not very easily

Some friends you grow old with
They'll be there till the very end
I do believe that
But not with her like I thought
Let her in and I'll get stabbed again

Dazed alone confused in thought
Feeling bad for whatever she's done
Got caught up fell in too deep
Played his part but she only blames she
She tells herself
Don't engage in all the wrong
He's not himself when that record comes on
He can't control the things he does
His well being in her prayers as her

Nights are long
The pain so strong
After all the lessons learned
Don't know which way she should turn
What makes her want to stay
So strong

She cries
I just want my baby back
I don't care I don't wanna think back
All the fights, the pain, the scars
Can't compare to the love in his heart
Now he's feeling bad for what he's done
He's himself cause that record is done
Apologies don't come in words
He puts a love song on says it for him their

Night is long
The love is bond
Forget what you've been through
Codependent lover that's her tune
For now his song plays on
Will you
After all the lessons learned
Codependent lover that's her tune
For now his song plays on
Will you
Play yours too
It goes on and on and on
Is it cool?

Like rain but love the sunshine

Feel I'm too deep to define
Simple inside
But I'm livin' the diva life

But might never show

A sista, a freak undercover
I do movies, I do dance, I do music

Sleep, my love
Don't you worry, you just sleep, my love
And I'll stroke your hair
Oh, the sunlight on your face
As the day begins to break

When you wake
And your smile meets mine, ah
My day begins
You're my inspiration
Seeing your face glow
Is the nicest of hellos

Five till noon, you sneak up from behind (Far from behind)
Kiss and caress me, make love to my mind
A whisper and a kiss from you warms my heart
Means so much
Making love our way begins early in the day

You walk in the room
In a sunset sort of mood
My emotions light up 'cause of you
Now that evening's come
We're dressed for us, my love
Wine and candles puts us in a sexy mood

That's when we get to it
Close our eyes, feel our way though it
I can't wait to groove ya, 'cause you sure know how to move it
You've made love to my mind
Now you gotta take me from behind
Just like in the movies when the action begins

Let's put on a show
(Can't you feel it?) And we'll take it nice and slow
(Can't you feel it?) Oh, here we go
(Can't you feel it?) Tell me, do you want the blindfold?
(Can't you feel it?) Tell me what you like
(Can't you feel it?) Baby, should I do it once or twice?
(Can't you feel it?) I know that we've getting' naughty
(Can't you feel it?) But I know you like it like that

Now that we felt this warm explosion
I know you're satisfied (I know you're satisfied)
I see it in your eyes (I see it in your eyes)
Relax, be still, my love (Still, my love)
Let your heart slow down (Heart slow down)
'Cause I'm not through my dear
Don't stop, remember twenty foreplay

Can you feel it? Twenty foreplay
I need it, twenty foreplay
You know I need, yes I need it
24 hours a day
Can you feel it? Twenty foreplay
Let me feel your twenty foreplay
Not yet
Twenty foreplay, I gotta have a twenty foreplay
I want a twenty foreplay
You know I need it, gotta have a foreplay
Twenty foreplay
I want it, I got to have foreplay
I want it, twenty foreplay
Twenty foreplay, yes I need it

It's not what you say
Before we start to play
It's what you say after
That makes me want to stay

Between the sheets, my mind was tellin' me
Now I see the single life's for me

This crazy for you, baby

It drives me, damn, baby
Now what I wanna see
If you shake that ass for me so

Come on, get up, baby
Before you make me change my mind

Because you're on my mind

Let me see it move it all night
Wanna see you shake it all night

Let me see you shake it all night
Let me see it move it all night

I don't know where this journey will end
'Cause the world keeps calling me
At home people embrace me as a friend
And I'm loving all the energy

I've come a long way
Got a long way to go
And I'm so well traveled
The only place in my life that I'll miss
It's on my bucket list
It's a place I don't know

In every race
Every place that I've ever been
There is so much beauty
Down every highway's the by-way to exit again
So much love I never wanna leave

I've come a long way
Got a long way to go
'Cause I'm so well traveled
Wherever life takes me I'm willing to go
Whatever it takes from me
I'ma let it all go

I think it's time to go
'Cause I'm so well traveled
Never stay too long
'Cause I'm so well traveled

Trippin' round the world
Destination unknown
Gotta keep movin'
Until I'm gone
To find the place
I never wanna arrive
'Cause if I ever reach there
There's no place left to go

Once upon a time was a dream that sounded crazy, baby
In fairytales of mine, you would be the one that saved me, oh baby
Any time I visualize you, I'm in paradise
It's you and me, though you don't even know it
So even with a million miles distance between us
I know you'll be there to help me escape

Take me away from here
To somewhere the air is clear
Take me away from here
Go somewhere where love has no fear
Go!

You'll always be that spy that was sent to save me
From intimate danger
The world's playin' my mind
When I'm 'bout to lose it
But you're the game changer
Oh this silly heart of mine lost to a cutie pie
He so turns me on, it keeps getting stronger
Ooh I get a natural high just looking in his eyes
So just hold me close, I'm waiting for you

Take me away from here
To somewhere the air is clear
Take me away from here
Go somewhere where love has no fear
Go!
Oh, uh oh
Oh, uh oh
Take me away
Oh, uh oh
Take me away oh just take me away
Go!

Take me away from here
Just somewhere the air is clear
Take me away from here
Go somewhere where love has no fear

And now all I see for me is better days

Afraid of my reflection
Tell me that's not me I see
That's who I wanna be
Stuck somewhere in the middle
On half full or half empty
Waitin' for somebody to come and rescue me

Can't let that petty attitude
Start to jade my point of view
Only thing it does is bring me down

Just let it go and life can feel so good
Stop livin' the blues

Start to jade my point of view
Only thing it does is bring me down

How you been breakin' me off?

9 ContributorsLuv Lyrics
I've been down this road before
I know it very well
And I just can't believe I've been struck
I didn't see it comin'
I was blindfolded
I'm caught up in collision
And now I'm so done
You crept up like a spider
I got caught in your web
And there was no way to escape

I tried to switch (My lanes)
But then I hit (My brakes)
Sparks turned into (Flames)
I shoulda stopped at the red light 'cause

Now, I'm like a deer caught in headlights, uh
He hit me with his luv, luv, luv, luv, luv, luv
He hit me with his luv
And now I'm in luv, luv, luv, luv
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his luv, luv, luv, luv, luv, luv

I was creepin' up the road
Just knew I had control
So how did I end up gettin' hit?
I had on my (Belt)
I checked it (Myself)
So how in the (World) did I get caught?
I had the right of way, huh, hey
I saw the sign you disobeyed (It's your fault)
I can't believe the way you would badger my heart
I think I should sue ya
I shoulda stopped at the red light 'cause

Now, I'm like a deer caught in headlights (Uh)
He hit me with his luv, luv, luv, luv, luv, luv
He hit me with his luv
And now I'm in luv, luv, luv, luv
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his luv, luv, luv, luv, luv, luv

You caught me by surprise
I can't believe that I'm
Falling for this guy
Somebody call the cops
'Cause I'm falling for that guy
You caught me by surprise
I can't believe that I'm
Falling for this guy
Somebody call the cops
'Cause I'm falling for that guy
I shoulda stopped at the red light 'cause

Now, I'm like a deer caught in headlights (Uh)
He hit me with his luv, luv, luv, luv, luv, luv
He hit me with his luv
And now I'm in luv, luv, luv, luv
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his luv

He crashed into my heart (Luv)
He crashed into my heart (Luv)
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his luv
He crashed into my heart (Luv)
He crashed into my heart (Luv)
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause

[Song 110: Island Life]
8 ContributorsIsland Life Lyrics
Come into this sacred and erotic dream
It's a world I know you wanna share
Baby, let's indulge in things that set our bodies free
Promise me that you will meet me there

What better way than to wind down
On streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds from the DJ
Damn, I think he's spinnin' this one for me

Island in the sun, just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song, I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo

Close my eyes and there you are in front of me
Takin' me to where I wanna go
Baby, from my little shop of curiosities
Boy, I'll show you all you need to know; come on, baby

What better way than to wind down
On streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds from the DJ
Damn, I think he's spinning this one for me

Island in the sun, just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song, I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo

What better way than to wind down
On streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds from the DJ
Damn, I think he's spinning this one for me

Island in the sun, just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song, I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo
Island in the sun, just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song, I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo

All night, I wanna give it to you

Every night, I'm gonna give it to you (Give me the high life)

All night I wanna give it to you (Give me the good life)

Every night I'm gonna give it to you
Give me the high life
Give me the good life
Give me the good life

Baby, I like it when it feels this good
You always seem to make me smile
And can't nobody do what you do
When you love me just a little while
I, I know you got somewhere to go
And I got somewhere to be right now
I'll make them wait all day long
If you wanna get a little wild

I don't want to be a distraction to you, no no no
So maybe I'll just lay around
Play by myself
While touching on my favorite fruit

Can't stop thinking 'bout the things we do
And how it feels makin' love to you
I'm ready to get it, baby, if you got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while
I wanna make it like a dream for you
Turn every fantasy into the truth
You know I'll take it anywhere that you wanna go right now
Just to love you for a little while

I, I like sleeping in your clothes
To smell you makes it all come down
When I think about me and you
Sometimes I get a little loud
Baby, I know we did it all night long
And I didn't want to burn you out
'Cause you know how much I like to do it
In the morning it's another round

I don't know if you have other things to do, no no no
So maybe I'll just lay around
Play by myself
While touching on my favorite fruit

Can't stop thinking 'bout the things we do
And how it feels making love to you
I'm ready to get it, baby, if you got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while
I'm gonna make it like a dream for you
And turn every fantasy into the truth
You know I'll take it anywhere that you wanna go right now
Just to love you for a little while

My passion flows like a river that has no end
I wanna know everything you'll let me do to you

Tell me what you like, baby
You wanna play with my strawberry?
Sometimes when I think about me and you
I can get real loud

Can't stop thinking 'bout the things we do
And how it feels making love to you
I'm ready to get it, baby, if you got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while
I wanna make it like a dream for you
And turn every fantasy into the truth
You know I'll take it anywhere that you wanna go right now
Just to love you for a little while

Just love me
Just love me for a little while (I'll take it anywhere for you)
Just love me for a little while (You make my juices flow)
Just love me for a little while (Tell me everything you'll let me do to you)
Just love me for a little while

Just remember everything I told you
Sorry for the pain that I have caused you
But you know it's true, I want to stay
I know you tried to make it what it should've been
But you were there to help me when I could've been
I don't know whatever came over me

Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we'd planned
Gimme that one more chance for me
Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we'd planned
Gimme that one more chance for me

I just want to do half of what you do
And I know it seems so strange for me to say this
If there is a hundred ways to say it
All in one and it means, "don't go away"
Everybody's going round tellin' you lies
But they don't know how hard that I've tried
You know it takes the pressure for me to see, hoo

Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we'd planned
Gimme that one more chance for me
Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we'd planned
Gimme that one more chance for me

If you could read my mind
How wonderful it'd be
Heaven's hard to find
And what it means to me is something I hate

Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we'd planned
Gimme that one more chance for me
Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we'd planned
Gimme that one more chance for me

I'm gonna prove it
I know we can do this
Love's not a playground
I think I let you down, ooh
Just give me one more chance
Say you love me
Say you love me
I want you to say it, say it
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Tell me, do you love me?
Now, do you love me?

Mmm, I close my eyes and fantasize
And I just imagine a tropical island
We're all alone, our pagers and cell phones cut off
Hot sunny heat, cool ocean breeze
The sand beneath our feet
The crashing waves are like music
Found a place to sleep
Passion fruit to eat
Use all our energy
Under the moonlight making love

I don't think nothing can compare
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than
Spending time with you
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than

So we don't have to do nothin' special
Don't wanna run
It's always fun to chill at home
Monday through Friday
Sexy Saturday, easy Sunday
'Cause every day's a special one, just like a holiday
Vacation getaway after the foreplay
Go room to room makin' sweet love

I don't think nothing can compare
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than

And you can flip on a trip but it's alright with me
If things were meant to be, to be they'd be meant
And what I'm here to represent is excellence
If you need any help, open your eyes and it's
Heavy D that you will see 'cause you're alright with me
Alright, woo...alright, woo...alright, woo...alright, woo
Baby, alright, woo...alright, woo...alright, woo...alright, woo

Never I'll doubt you
My heart belongs to you
That's alright with me
Worlds could end around me
So in love that I can't see
You and me were meant to be
That's alright with me

Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin
I'll love you 'til the end
You know it's true, my friend

It's alright, I tell you that it's alright with me
Worlds could end around me
So in love I can't see
You and me were meant to be
Sure 'nough, it's alright with me

Now be it thick as a milkshake
Or thin as a cornflake
I love you to death but I ain't pressed for the heartbreak
And anyway, who cares about what other people talk about?
I'd rather hear it from the horse's mouth
See, I believe in, being believed in
No love lives, no low tides, it's all paper thin
But watch for the trickery, some people are slippery
They appear making history, disappear like a mystery
It ain't your fault but you're a walking bank vault
Some people unliked make love as bitter as salt
They say what they want to say
Play how they want to play
But you got to live your life day by day
In order to survive you overlook and overcome
Selfish attitude or lack of gratitude for the dumb
It ain't easy being you and everything you wanna be
But whatever you do is alright with me
The bon-diddly-dee
The overweight lover MC, the cap
The rap, the hand clap, foot tap
Heavy D, dee, dee, dee

Alright, baby...alright, baby
Alright with me
Alright, baby...alright, baby
Alright, baby...alright, baby
Alright, baby...alright, baby
Alright, baby...alright, baby
Alright with me
Alright...alright

[Song 122: Promise of You]
6 ContributorsPromise of You Lyrics
Who can tell you
The promise of you
Will you
Live up to
The promise of you

Gotta stop
Say a prayer
I’m in shock
Can’t believe you just said
I’m nothing
Who are you
Judging me
‘Cause I don’t think like you
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Who can tell you
The promise of you
The beautiful flower
That just hasn’t bloomed
You’re judging the surface
But what’s growing inside
Just might amaze you

Bring it on
I’m prepared
Say I can’t
But I don’t even care
Doing things
You couldn’t dream
So just watch
While I keep doin’ me
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Say a prayer

Don’t recreate me as a clone
Won’t accept no as I go
Gotta vision all my own
I’ll control
The promise of you

Call me strange
I’m unique
No disrespect
I dance to my own beat
‘Cause I know
It’s up to me
Yeah to be
The promise I vow to keep

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Song 123: Take Care]
6 ContributorsTake Care Lyrics
Glass of wine, candlelight
Music made for quiet times
I'm feelin' mellow
I need my sweetie pie
Here to lay me out tonight
I want it, I want it but I can't get it

Take good care of me tonight
At home I'm so alone
I'm wishin' you were here
Baby, tonight my bed is cold
I'm wishin' you were near
'Cause I'm in a sexy mood
And only you can fill my needs
I'll lay here and take care of it 'til you come home to me

Always sound sensuous any time we pillow talk
Using such few words
I get sensitive when you work
It feels so good when it hurts
Always want more and more
And I know you can't be here
That usually don't faze me
I need you tonight
Boy, it's drivin' me crazy
Yearnin' inside with this burnin' desire
I want it, I want it but I just can't get it from you

Take good care of me tonight
At home I'm so alone
I'm wishin' you were here
Baby, tonight my bed is cold
I'm wishin' you were near
'Cause I'm in a sexy mood
And only you can fill my needs
I'll lay here and take care of it 'til you come home to me

Ah, ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, fulfill my needs
Ah ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, fulfill my needs
Ah, ah, whatever you can be
Ah, ah, I'll take good care of me

Take good care of me tonight
At home I'm so alone
I'm wishin' you were here
Baby, tonight my bed is cold
I'm wishin' you were near
'Cause I'm in a sexy mood
And only you can fill my needs
I'll lay here and take care of it 'til you come home to me

At home I'm so alone
I'm wishin' you were here
Baby, tonight my bed is cold
I'm wishin' you were near
'Cause I'm in a sexy mood
And only you can fill my needs
I'll lay here and take care of it 'til you come home to me

Ah, ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, fulfill my needs
Ah, ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, fulfill my needs
Ah, ah, whatever you can be
Ah, ah, I'll take care of me

[Song 124: With U]
7 ContributorsWith U Lyrics
Strangely I feel a connection with you, babe
Oddly enough I crave for it to remain purely
More authentic than I've been used to
Surely this can't be something that's taboo

'Cause you got it like I like it and I feel the need to say
Baby, it's forever and I really mean to
Make you feel as special as I see you, baby
Never have I ever been around someone
Who makes life so free and life so fun
And as crazy as it may sound, I ain't joking, baby

'Cause when I'm in those arms of yours, I'm so gone
The things I like, can't tell me it's not right
When I'm with you, I lose myself
And no one can make me do what I can't wait to do
When I'm with you

Really I get inspired off you, baby
Truly I feel alive from you
And you're the only, no one else can duplicate you
I'd leave the one I have, I know, it's sad but damn you

Got it like I like it and I feel the need
To say baby, it's forever and I really mean to
Make you feel as special as I see you, baby
Never have I ever been around someone
Who makes life so free and life so fun
And as crazy as it may sound, I ain't joking, baby

'Cause when I'm in those arms of yours, I'm so gone
The things I like, can't tell me it's not right
When I'm with you, I lose myself
And no one can make me do what I can't wait to do
When I'm with you

The times that we've shared together
Are some of the best times of my life
I wish you were the one I could be with forever
'Cause when I'm with you, I don't want tomorrow to come
And if I had my way, I'd spend every day and night in your arms
So let me lay here and feel what happiness feels like
And wish for it to last because tomorrow it's back to real life
Until then, I'll just keep dreaming

'Cause when I'm in those arms of yours, I'm so gone
The things I like, can't tell me it's not right
When I'm with you, I lose myself
And no one can make me do what I can't wait to do
When I'm with you

[Song 125: Nothing]
8 ContributorsNothing Lyrics
There's something I wanna say
Something I've been holding back
Can't let it go another day
Let me start by saying that
Nothing, nothing
Nothing means more than the truth

And the truth is that I realize
Love is fading from your eyes
Don't know how it came to this
But we gon' get it fixed tonight
'Cause nothing, nothing
Nothing is worth losing you

Tell me, what could the problem be
That's got you drinking way too much?
What could it be 'bout us?
Don't you tell me, "Not right now"
I can't let it go (I can't let it go, no, I can't let it go, oh no)
What can I do to help you see
That there's no need for jealousy or insecurities?
I'll do anything you want
You can even have the password to my phone

Because nothing (Nothing), nothing
Should come between us
Trust in me, trust in me
Cherish every moment
Like it's the last
Trust in me
Trust in me

If your issue is with trust
Hear me when I tell you this
No one else has shared my love
No one else has had your kiss
Nothing, nothing
Nothing can make me forget, no
Forget that you're a good man
And I know that you've had it hard
'Cause you're more than adequate
You're more than I wish for
Nothing, nothing
Nothing can make you any less

Tell me, what could the problem be?
The past is something I can't change, it's a brand new day
Don't you tell me, "Not right now"
I can't let it go (Can't let it go, no, I can't let it go, oh no)
We've got to fix this, fix this right this minute
Only pure love can calm the noise
'Cause baby, when we give pure love
Pure love will never come back to us void

Because nothing (Nothing), nothing
Should come between us
Trust in me, trust in me
Cherish every moment
Like it's the last
Trust in me, trust in me

You know you can't change me

[Song 130: Thinkin’ Bout My Ex]
9 ContributorsThinkin’ Bout My Ex Lyrics
When I first met you
I swear that I was straight with you
I wasn't lookin' for nobody new
I just needed someone to talk to
You said you were cool and understood
But now you caught feelings like I knew you would
And you sittin' there with a broken heart
'Cause I gave you my body (Body) and not my heart

When I'm holding you late at night
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When I'm kissing you and look at you
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart

Baby, I have to be unselfish and true to me
'Cause I'm not where I really wanna be
And it's nothin' with you, it's all me (It's all me)
I toss and turn all night when I sleep (Oh)
Wantin' and reachin' for someone who used to be (Oh)
I said it must be some kinda karma thing
'Cause I can't seem to let go (Let go), love again

And when I lay with you, I close my eyes
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When I'm touchin' you gently
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry (Sorry), I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
When I'm listenin' to music
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
In a bubble bath, with the candles lit
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry (Sorry), I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart

(You're beautiful) I don't wanna take the space from someone else
(So let me go) And do a little soul searchin' for myself
(I'm sorry that) I pulled you in and let it get this far
You know I never meant to break your heart

At the shopping mall (Shopping mall) or movies (Movies)
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
At the restaurant (Restaurant) while I'm eating (Eating)
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry (Sorry), I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
(I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
While you talk to me (Talk to me), I drift away (Drift away)
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When you ask me (Ask me) what I'm thinkin' (Thinkin')
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry (Sorry) I didn't mean (Didn't mean) to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
(I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
At the shopping mall (Shopping mall) or movies (Movies)
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
(I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
At the restaurant  (Restaurant) while I'm eating (Eating)

(I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)

You know, it's not what you think it is

[Song 131: God’s Stepchild]
7 ContributorsGod’s Stepchild Lyrics
Got a story for you
'Bout a little friend
Never felt good enough
Had a heart to mend
Never felt pretty
Learned to just pretend
Wished someone had listened
For her silent cries of pain

Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild

Didn't want to burden
Mother had enough distress
So often I'd talk to you
Through my four-legged friends
Always there to listen
Though I felt so all alone
And in my times of trouble
I know you saw my smiles of pain

Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild

Now that I'm much older
I've gone through so much pain
I learned that I should love me
No more feeling ashamed
I've seen the great illusions
I've sought the rough terrain
I'm walking my own journey
And my love for you remains

Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild
Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild

I know I'm the lucky one
I know I'm a special one
I know that God does
Not have a stepchild

As a child, I missed a lot of love I never had
And daddy, he was distant, never there to hold my hand
Never bought the things he'd always promise to give me
Mother made up for him always watching over me
Days would go by and we would never see his face
In my mind, I'd wonder "Does he have another place?"
If and when he'd come in, he would always be upset
All the kids were scared, his looks alone would be a threat

Now that you are older and you begin to see
Family's important to be there if you need

Tell me

Daddy daddy dearest, what is it you want from me? (Tell me)
I won't turn my back on you the way you did with me
Now you try to give, I'm always reaching out to grab
I'll give you what I can, but I can't give what I don't have

Mother lends a shoulder, to cry on if you need (Mother lends a shoulder)
But are you there for mother when she needs your company? (When she needs your company)

[Song 136: Alone]
6 ContributorsAlone LyricsALONE
Lying, thinking
Last night
How to find my soul a home
Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone
I came up with one thing
And I don't believe I'm wrong
That nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.
There are some millionaires
With money
they can't use
Their wives run round like banshees
Their children sing the blues
They've got expensive doctors
To cure their hearts of stone.
But nobody
No, nobody
Can make it out here alone.

Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Now if you listen closely
I'll tell you what I know
Storm clouds are gathering
The wind is gonna blow
The race of man is suffering
And I can hear the moan,
'Cause nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.

Do you think there's something funny about this scenario?
We ain't spent a minute apart since the day we said "hello"
I adore your conversation and your vibe's so sensual
Are you feelin' my connection? I just wanna know

In the thundering rain
You stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand
Moving up my thighs
Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips

I don't wanna stop just because
People walking by are watching us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
I'm not gonna stop no, no, no
I want you
All I wanna say is

Any time, and any place, I don't care who's around
Any time, and any place, I don't care who's around
No, no, no, no, no

Dancing on the floor
Feeling the slow groove
My mind is starting to burn
With forbidden thoughts
Strangers all around
With the lights down low
I was thinking maybe we could, well, you know

I don't wanna stop just because
People standing around are watching us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
I'm not gonna stop no, no, no
I want you
All I wanna say is

Any time, and any place, I don't care who's around
No no no no, no no no
Any time, baby
And any place
I don't care who's around
Say it again, say it, honey
Any time, and any place, I don't care who's around

I don't care who's around
Any time, baby
Any place

You've seen my show, you followed my tour
I heard you scream with eighty-thousand more
But tonight I close out my tour in your room
Know I pull 'em out of the crowd and guess who?
The band is in place, the cameras are set
I'll make sure we tape it so you don't forget
I'ma take control, take it slow so don't move
It's 'bout to go down so just wait for my cue

House lights go low
Spotlight up more
It's time so
Sit back and enjoy the show

Time to close the curtains
Come on in the stage is set
Before the show starts mic check
Tonight is so exclusive
We should make it pay-per-view
Time to close the curtains
I only take requests from you
Just tell me what you want me to do
I promise you, you'll be screaming out "encore" when I'm through

Let's change the set, try some new steps
Let's take it somewhere we haven't been yet
Its gon' be kinda hard 'cause I can't always bring you
The crowd is screamin' out "I want more," I hear you
How is your seat, can you see everything?
Baby, I don't want you missin' a thing
I'ma dedicate this next one to you
'Cause you're my number one fan and I'm showing you love

House lights go low
Spotlight up more
It's time so
Sit back and enjoy the show

Time to close the curtains
Come on in the stage is set
Before the show starts mic check
Tonight is so exclusive
We should make it pay-per-view
Time to close the curtains
I only take requests from you
Just tell me what you want me to do
I promise you, you'll be screaming out "encore" when I'm through

Now's the perfect time for an intermission
If you need somethin' to drink
Better get it right now (Right now)
Better break it down (Right now)
'Cause I don't wanna stop no more
Now I come upon the end of the show
Let me slow it down
I'm not ready to go
There's a finale so don't open the door

Time to close the curtains (Just close the curtains, baby)
Come on in the stage is set (Stage is set)
Before the show starts mic check (Baby, baby)
Tonight is so exclusive
We should make it pay-per-view
Time to close the curtains
I only take requests from you
Just tell me what you want me to do
I promise you, you'll be screaming out "encore"when I'm through

You're so kind
Just what I asked for, you're so loving and kind
And you're mine
And I can't believe you're mine

Doesn't matter if you're feeling insecure
Doesn't matter if you're feeling so unsure
'Cause I'll take away the doubt within' your heart
And show that my love will never hurt or harm

And fall into the sublime?

Touch it and stimulate it
'Til I can feel it deep inside?
Don't be so uptight (you know it feels right)

Get lost in all of this love

Saw the cover, the finest girl that you've ever seen
Just had to buy me, had to try me
Ooh, you're in love with the hottest girl in the magazine
You do whatever to have me all to yourself
I know you can't stop lookin' so don't try to deny it
Baby, I can see in your eyes
You'd do anything if I let you inside of me
What would you do if I came to life? Let me tell ya

This body of mine, this body of mine

And you'll go crazy when you see me, see me
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around
Start shakin' and movin' all around

Now we're at your home, lead the way to your room
What you're lookin' for is right on page 52
You see what you like, reading about what I like
When I'm all alone in the zone with a man
Now would you be ready if I stepped off these pages
And told you that that man was you?
Or would you turn out to have some great conversation
But didn't know what to do, once you got a look at

This body of mine, this body of mine
Boy, I'm trying to warn you about
This body of mine, this body of mine
And you'll go crazy when you see me, see me

Saw this girl on the cover of Maxim, made a (Nigga) jaw drop
Man, she was F-I-N-E, head to toe
Six-page spread, baddest thang I ever seen befo'
Stuck in the store dreaming, can't even get to the register
Girl behind the counter talking ,but I'm like the hell with her
'Cause I swear I deserve this girl talking through the pages
Telling me what she like and how she like it in different places
What she eat to keep her body tight, definition of Mr. Right
I fit that description to the T, to the T
All the (Shit) that she don't like, live for a late night
It sounds like she's talking right to me, especially when she said

I know you can't stop lookin', so don't try to deny me
Baby, I can see in your eyes
You'd do anything if I let you inside me
What would you do if I came to life? Let me tell ya

This body of mine, this body of mine
