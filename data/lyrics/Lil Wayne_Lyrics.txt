And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, "'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said, "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said, "Baby, just make me cum
Then don't make a sound"

Call that breakfast in bed, 69, 96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges

I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I said get him" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothing, keep resting,"
She say, "What's missing?"—"How you know something missing?"
He scratched his head, she say, "Get back in bed,"
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, "Ooh"

I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,"
And if he say yeah, then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you"
She gave me a salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier!"
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona

Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself

She say, "Ooh, daddy, ooh,"
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, "Ooh," dead emotion (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah

Six-six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Ahem
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish, ha!

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch (Yeah)
Six-six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch (I'm goin' back in)

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler, Wayne
These niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side
Bitch, I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga
Ya heard? Gunna

I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga

Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

I'm the only one that get the job done

Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that

Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

Rip rip, nigga

You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the

Mirror on the wall (Woah)
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall (Uh)
You've been my only friend (Yeah)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the

Mirror on the wall
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall (Uh-huh)
You've been my only friend (My only friend)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am (They can't understand)
So why are we here (Misunderstood)
Talking to each other again? (Woah)

Looking at me now, I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mama smile, that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message could've been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the

Mirror on the wall (MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall (Uh)
You've been my only friend (Take 'em to Mars, man)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we
Talking to each other again? (Uh)
Mirror on the wall (Woah)
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend (Any questions?)
You told me that they can (I come to you)
Understand the man I am (You always have the answer)
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

Mirror on the wall
Hey B.P, looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time
So why are we
Talking to each other again?

I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up, 'cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes, I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

I torture you

I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Ooh (Oh), I'm just a sucker for pain
Uh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow, but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now gettin' it (Gettin' it)
Ain't got no other way, so we start it and finish it (Finish it)
No pain (No pain), no gain (No gain)
Never stand down, made our own way (Own way)
Never going slow, we pick up the pace (Pick up the pace)
This is what we wanted from a young age (Young age)
No emotion, that's what business is (Business is)
Lord have mercy on the witnesses (Witnesses)

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you (Oh)
I'm just a sucker for pain

More pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin'...

Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
Motherfucker, I'm ill

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derrière
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, "Look at that bastard Weezy!"
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch, haha
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

Motherfucker, I'm ill

See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour, haha
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say "Life ain't shit without me"
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, 'cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat

Ugh, AK on my nightstand, right next to that Bible
But I swear, with these fifty shots, I'll shoot it out with Five-O
Pockets gettin' too fat, no Weight Watchers, no lipo
Money talks, bullshit walks on a motherfucking tightrope
And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga, you get beat the crap out, but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose-pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night, like porch lights
Let's do it, fuck talking, we out here, we ballin'
And I'm spraying at these rusty niggas like WD-40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up; no if, ands, or butt-fucks
Bitch niggas go behind your back like nunchucks, and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly, well, tell them hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit, fuck Gucci
She blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches
And that's 2 Chainz

Look at you (Aw), now look at us
All my niggas look rich as fuck (Yeah)
All my niggas live rich as fuck (Yeah)
All—All my niggas look rich as fuck (Yeah)
Look at you (Look at you), now look at us (Now look at us)
All my niggas look rich as fuck (Bitch)
All my—All my niggas live rich as fuck (You hoe-ass bi—)
All my—All—All my ni—

Ugh, never talk to the cops, I don't speak Pig Latin
I turned a penny to a motherfuckin Janet Jackson
Tell the bitches that be hatin' I ain't got no worries
I just want to hit and run like I ain't got insurance, ho
What's your name? What's your sign? Zodiac Killer
All rats gotta die, even Master Splinter
Yeah, murder, one-eighty-seven
I be killing them bitches, I hope all dogs go to heaven
And I got Xanax, Percocet, promethazine with codeine
Call me Mr. Sandman, I'm sellin' all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat-ass, TV screen
I keep a bad bitch, call me "The B.B. King"
And you know I got that mouth out her
Then put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
And I see your girl when I want
I got that ho TiVo'd, ugh
Got a red-ass bitch with a red-ass pussy
Nigga try me, that's a dead-ass pussy
Since y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch
And pussy feel just like Heaven on Earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt
RIP: Rest In Pussy
Light that shit, then pass that shit, we gon' get so smoked out
And then I went, got locked up; every night, I dreamt I broke out
One time for them pussy niggas—that's that shit I don't like
We eatin' over here, nigga—fuck around and have a food fight
And that's 2 Chainz

Look at you (Uh), now look at us (Yeah)
All my niggas look rich as fuck (What?)
All my niggas live rich as fuck (What?)
All-all my niggas look rich as fuck (Yeah)
Look at you, now look at us (Aye fuck all y'all bitches, straight up)
All my niggas look rich as fuck (Any bitch out there that ain't never wanna give me no pussy)
All my-all my niggas live rich as fuck (Fuck you in your asshole, bitch)
All my-all-all my niggas look rich as fuck

(Ahem)

I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention, but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real"
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel"
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now, she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now, she will, she will, she will, uh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now, she will, she will, she will (Uh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now, she will
(Yeah)

I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that whine 'n' dine
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, "Choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split (Aha)

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real"
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel"
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal

Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now, she will, she will, she will, uh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now, she will, she will, she will (Uh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now, she will
Ladies and gentlemen, Drizzy
Woo, yeah

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real" (Alright, well alright, well alright, uh)
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel" (Feelin' like the sky is opening, and I am entering, yeah)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal (Uh, feelin' like like the world is falling and I am rising, alright, well alright, well alright, woo)
And she bad, so maybe she won't, uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah (Carter IV, baby, alright, well alright, well alright, uh, Tunechi)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now, she will, yeah (Alright, well alright, well alright)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now, she will, she will, she will (Uh, alright, well alright, well alright, uh, you know she will)

C5

Don't cry (Oh), don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads, "Don’t cry, stay tuned"
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry, don't cry)

Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun"
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, "It's just you and I"
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll (Let 'em drop and roll)

Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, woah
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry)

Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise

Kane is in the building
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
And I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train
Yes I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, 'cause I made more off my second leg
Motherfuckin' Birdman Junior, 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker

If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

And I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'

You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'

You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside, MOB Piru Damu

I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young Mula, skinnies and some Supras
Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker

I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga

What the fuck, though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a shit show, put you front row
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches, and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go, where's the uproar?

What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, woah
Puff, puff, bro; I don't huff though
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
"Knock, knock!" "Who's there?" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so
What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro
We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow (Woo!)
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go? (Oh!)
Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross (Goddamn!)
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go? (Talk to 'em, Weezy!)
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, ma'fucker
‘Cause all this bullshit just made me strong, ma'fucker

So I pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

Uh
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Haha, yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
I'm gone

It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream: "Fuck 'em all!"

Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Oops, time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog

113 ContributorsNo Worries Lyrics
You can look me in my face
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
See the sh-rooms keep me up
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there we ain't got no worries

Tunechi in this bitch, e'rybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be diggin' me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear’ll have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleep
All these bitches think they’re the shit, I’ll send them up Schitt’s creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's okay if you turn up just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it
B’s up, Blood Gang; Piru it, and all rats gotta die even Stuart
On my private jet and my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch Nigga
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers
You don't get dissed, you get disfigured
She say sorry I didn't shave so that pussy a little furry
I put that pussy in my face: I ain't got no worries
Tunechi

You can look me in my face
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
See the sh-rooms keep me up
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there, redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there, we ain't got no worries

We ain't got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain't got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar, I say "Why you in a hurry?"
She say "Why you asking questions?" I say "Bitch you tryna be funny!"
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar
That camel toe, that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my ho, I swear she was with my ho
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch, it's Tunechi and I'm out chea, no worries no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit'd be a long story
YEAHHH, OHH SHIT, I'M UP, YEAHH, YOUNG MULA BABY!

You can look me in my face
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
See the sh-rooms keep me up

(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there

Cut the music up
A little louder, yeah

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, mm
For a second you were here (Hey), now you over there (Hey, hey)
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love (Ayy), never had a love (Ayy)

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly, it's like a blessin'
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sittin' here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, ah, how to love, mm
For a second you were here (Hey), now you over there (Hey)
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body (Hey)
Like you never had a love (Ayy), uh, had a love (Ayy)

Oh, and you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listenin', but
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartendin' and strippin', baby
So don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You seen a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, oh

See, I just want you to know
That you deserve the best, you're beautiful (Ayy)
You're beautiful (Ayy), yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual (Ayy), far from the usual (Ayy)

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, mm
See, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, yeah
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, mm

"Just saw an alien saucer approaching from the sky
Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy"

.44 bulldog, my motherfuckin' pet
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker, "Fetch"
I'm fuckin' her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth, and ass, call that bitch triple-threat
When I was in jail, she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death
Top down, it's upset
Been fucking the world, and nigga, I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch, I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep, so Weezy can't rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
Yeah, load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Big black nigga in a icy watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch, I got a Nike shop
Count the profits, you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans, kick 'em off, they might be hot, swish
I'm swimming in a yellow bitch (Boss)
In the red 911 looking devilish (Haha)
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof 'til he got hit the fifth time
Drop palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before (Yeah)
Baby, I'm the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected, got killers off in Chicago

I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
Yeah, oad up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Talk stupid, get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch, I'm Redd Foxx
Big B's, Red Sox
I get money to kill time, dead clocks
You fucking with a nigga who won't give a fuck
Empty the clip then roll the window up
Pussy nigga sweet, them niggas Cinnabon
I'm in a red bitch, she said she finna cum
200 thou' on a chain, I don't need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E
Five letters, YMCMB
Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga
I see ya looking, with ya looking ass nigga
You know the rules, kill 'em all and keep moving
If I died today, it'd be a holiday, huh

I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car, so don't make it come alive (Yeah)
Rip your ass apart, then I pull myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever
The bigger the bullet, the more that bitch go "Bang"
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint (Yeah)
Red Lamborghini 'til I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, papi gave me forty bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape (Yeah)
Ain't it funny, mama only son be bakin' cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm Santa Claus
Niggas gather 'round, got gifts for each and all of y’all
Take it home and let it bubble, that's the double up (Yeah)
If you get in trouble, that just mean you fuckin' up (NIgga)
It's a cold world, I need a bird to cuddle up (Yeah)

Yo
Yo, Drew and Inf' did this
This right here is crazy
Yeah, I, I feel big, you know what I mean?
Like, not, not big in the sense of, weight
You know what I mean? Like gainin' weight or nothin' like that
Like colossal
Like, you know what I mean, like (sighs)
I heard you were lookin' for me
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Haha, you know, hehe)
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (I know, haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hey, hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Shit, you know)
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)

Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say "Church!" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
'Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me 'cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world and I'm back again!
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)

Around the world now I'm back again!
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)

Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush 'em and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: "Wayne quit!?"
'Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, 'cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream "Soo-woo" and "Da-da-doe"
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin')
Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)

I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, "What up, killa?" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Hova!)
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Weezy)
They've been wondering why (Baby!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hahaha)
Tell me, where have you been? (I been hustlin')
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Hustlin' hard)
They've been wondering why (Chyeah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why
And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve

Watch for the spy cam, sit back and watch, and do not watch your watch hand, give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man, I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock, but it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land
Back to the block where they got more rock fans than a fuckin' rock band under a rock, man
We need Barack, man, I do what I can to keep it solid as a-- you know what I'm sayin'
With some rock playin'

"You tatted your face and changed the culture" (You changed)
"You screamed, 'Suu whoop,' and them gangsters loved you" (Yeah, yeah)
"You bought a Bugatti so you could flex" (So you can flex)
"And most of the bad bitches your ex"

I started this shit, you just part of this shit, I'm the heart of this shit, and the heart doesn't skip
Take the heart of yo' bitch, 'cause like Bart, you a simp, and your water don't drip so your garden ain't shit
You just countin' the money, I'm drownin' in money, like, "Where the fuck is the lifeguard in this bitch?"
I go Mars in this bitch, watch me orbit and shit, for the art of this shit, Andy Warhol and shit
Go retarded as shit, you go sweet, tangy, I go tart on this shit, I'ma barf on this shit
I'm a martian and shit, you an orphan, lil' bitch, if I taught you some shit, that's like Harvard, lil' bitch
You ain't talkin' 'bout shit but you softer than shit, walk it like you talk it, now you walkin' in shit
I go Marvel movie on some marvelous shit, in the spotlight too long, should be darker than this
This is Tha Carter, lil' bitch

"You tatted your face and changed the culture" (You changed)
"You screamed, 'Suu whoop,' and them gangsters loved you" (Yeah, yeah)
"You bought a Bugatti so you could flex" (So you can flex)
"And most of the bad bitches your ex"

I started this shit, they borrowed this shit, I thought of this shit, they thought it was it
I'm doggin' this shit, they bark and they sit, put a fork in that shit, which drawer to look in?
I brought in this shit, the starters get benched, the orders get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile, I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit in the foreign car that I could talk to and shit
With a cultural bitch I can talk to and shit 'bout the culture and shit, how I altered this shit

Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo, tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
All of that shit, just Tha Carter, lil' bitch
You changed, suu whoop (You tatted your face)
Bugatti, new boo ("You screamed, 'Suu whoop'—")
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tunechi

Yeah, it's Mr. Michael Myers, man (Michael Myers)
Word to Moneybagg, I keep it comin' in (Woo, woo)
By the way we work, you think I had a twin (Twin)
I'm tryna run the game, it ain't no subbin' in (Naw)
You can't phase me, slidin' from a dangerous life (It's lit)
Always down to ball, I'm tryna drain these nights
See the smoke clouds through the entertainment lights
The way it go down we takin' fours and keepin' doors tight, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
We at the top, end of discussion (Discussion)
They mixin' alcohol and that 'tussin (Ooh)
The demon in their eyes and they clutchin' (Scared)
I feed 'em Adderall and they bussin', yeah (Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew)
I kept the towel, not throwin' in, I'm ridin' 'round in my ends
I got a driver for the Bent' to drive me 'round when I'm bent
I keep some pussy just to lick to help me out when I vent
She wanna hit that shit again, nah (Brr-brr)
(Brr-brr) That's the phone call, when my blood ring
It's Tha Carter V, let the thugs sing (Thugs)

It's C5, been arrived, kiss the sky, did the time
Please advise, it is advised to be advised, and we advise
You not fuck with me and mine, and keep in mind that we don't mind
Losin' our minds, free your mind, read your mind, read your mind
Body take a week to find, the cops gon' be like, "Never mind"
What's on your mind? Put the pistol to your mind and blow your mind
Control your mind, mind freak, no sober mind, I'm so behind
But front line, you crossed the line, and you better know your lines
And if you gettin' out of line, I hang you with a clothin' line
Wring you like an open line, keep your stanky ho in line
Them hoes be lyin', it's a thin line, and I know you know the line
Second line, second line, Tunechi got effective lines
Rough edges like a box of Checkers fries, that's a line
Catch the line, American flag, less stars, extra lines
Stretch the line, skip the line, 'til you no more next in line
Yeah, Tunechi-Tune a lunatic, my goonie-goons the gooniest
Run inside your room and kill you and who you roomin' with
The Uzi with the booty clip, more than one, I'm too equipped
Talkin' 'bout some fake niggas, based on true events
Tryin' not to get pinched, smokin' on a stupid stench
Lookin' in the mirror tryin' to figure where my pupils went
Flashy with a boujee bitch, Travy, that's my hooligan (It's lit)
Take the T off Tunechi and look at it as the crucifix, bitch

C5, best rapper alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let it fly

Uh, my mind's filled with minefields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It's Judgement Day or a fire drill
Yeah, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lyin', yeah
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill 'em all and let 'em die

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
The end of time is like a hour away, damn

Military-minded, lost and can't find it
The stars on the flag are never shinin'
Uh, I saw a butterfly in Hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
'Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed
Mama said, "Take what you want" – I took heed, yeah

Now let it breathe, yeah

Back to life, back to reality
Been eatin'my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities
Granted, we do it for vanity not humanity
But what's appealin' to me is under banana trees
Love, I go so hard, I tried to pay homage, but I was overcharged
Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say, "Fuck the police," now I say, "Fuck jail"
Same shit, different air freshener
I don't play, boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number nine
And I just fucked the clock and let it come with time
It's a cold world, I put on a mink
There's a chain of commands, I'm the missin' link

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
And I'm smokin'on them flowers, catch the bouquet

Here, we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in Hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?

You cannot break down what can't be broken (Uh)
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights they get low
And all of the curtains they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

They could do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Said, now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who? I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gon' break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you
(Errr!)

You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen (Yeah)
When all of the lights they get low (Low)
And all of the curtains they close (They close)
You cannot break down (You can't) what can't be broken (Uh)

G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
Yeah, we bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes
G-code (Can't be broken)

I ain't finna break or fix the brakes, you emulate
I'm laughing in your face, now fix your face, I can't disintegrate
'Cause I facilitate a mil' a day for like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe, want to get away?
No, I'm here to stay, I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today, got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

You cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights they get low
And all of the curtains they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Uh)

G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
Yeah, we bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes
G-code (Can't be broken)

Work out, yeah

Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I’m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch

Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
"Don't let the money come between us"
I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, "Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out"
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, "Let that shit work itself out"
"Let that shit work itself out"

C5
Yeah, back in this bitch
Tune you left this bitch
Like you knew this bitch was gon' let your ass back in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch

Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can hear them pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, "Tune, you knew me for way too long"
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, "Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out, let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out, let it all work out"

Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, "I'm sorry for even apologizing"
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

Yeah, and he said
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"
(I'm still in this bitch)
"Let it all work out"
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
"Let it all work out"
Let it all work out (Phew)
"Let it all work out"
(But he said, "Remember this:")
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out"
("Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch")
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"
("And don't forget what I did this, bitch")
"Let it all work out"
("Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch")
"Let it all—"
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"

Woo, this that shit they didn't want me on
I'm 'bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lamb', I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in a wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little gals
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweler ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, "cock-a-doodle"
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you (Glory)
Glory

I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-hoo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I'll sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, "Surprise," but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely when sortin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord

Am I talkin' crazy? Too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, "Be quiet, we need our privacy"
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, hook you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's cruisin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em

Glory, hallelujah (I got 'em)
(Glory)
I got 'em
(I got 'em)
I got 'em

She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas (go figure)
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch-ass bitches

And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this should explain that you're the one that taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch-ass bitches

Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not forever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for "Fuck you"

No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl you done taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch-ass bitches

My girl like it rough she said “find me a diamond”
Her body be grindin’
Lord we be on every kind of narcotic
That make us believe, when we lyin’, we honest, I love you
Pick, Michael Jackson to Jordan to Tyson to Myers
Too much dirty money when the colors
Are washing the whites in the dryer my nigga
It ain’t rocket science just rockets
I sleep in pussy not pajamas, grindin'
I got this shit down to a science, I turn in my project, A minus
Whew, I ain’t crazy, I’m krazy and all of my niggas chaotic
Dressed in all black like they gothic
Music too loud to hear sirens, we pop, pop, pop up where you stay
Knock, knock, knock, anyone home?
Pop, pop, pop, pop then we outtie
I need a bitch like Naomi to take off her clothes like Leilani for niggas that’s grindin’

Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

The feds be spying on all of us nigga
These hoes be lying to all of us nigga
I got news for the monogamous niggas
Yo' bitch fucking anonymous niggas
I done seen it all my nigga
'Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas
'Cause what’s the hottest shit on these corners?
That’s me and all my niggas
Grind for all this shit, I ain’t ever fall for that bitch
'Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird
Is like a medicine ball to that bitch
We'll bring Gucci bag in this bitch
And you know what's stashed in that bitch
These niggas walk around with they chests out
Like Janet Jackson and shit
I’m sweatin’ grindin’ this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck double O seven, I work twenty-four seven
Ain’t got time to bond with no bitch
Heard Jay Z got a new Cognac, where to find that shit?
The weed sticky, grind that shit
Where I got it from? Nevermind that shit
Nigga, I'm grindin'

Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit

Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

Yeah
I got a new vision for all my shit (for all my)
I don’t know what to call that shit (don’t know what to call it)
I know, I’m selling all of my cars
I’m selling all of my watches
I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit (don’t need it)
I’m a different breed with this shit (yeah)
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch (yeah)
And I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch (woo!)
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill' in one room (huh?)
You, you could ask anyone out here who running the game?
And they’ll tell you the truth, man, they tell you (and they tell you)
Oh look, they fuck with me now (hey)
I think they’re hearin' me now (yeah)
Someone said, "Nigga, they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like, "I think they just might be scared of me now" (might be scared of me now)
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day (every day), niggas wrong every day (true)
Gone, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe (nope)
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka, that’s grindin'

Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

(Grindin’, grindin’) Perfect timing
(Grindin’, grindin’)

I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Then peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space
Believe that

Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
'Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out, they flew out
Invite 'em to my new house, my new house
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, grindin’
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindin’
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I’m grindin’

Twap, twap!
Twap, twap!
In the new house, we got the twap

[Song 30: Pussy Money Weed]
46 ContributorsPussy Money Weed Lyrics
I love her like—
Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like—
Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like—
Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like—
Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like—

Oh, yes, I love her, like Egyptian
Want a description? Her body's sickening
I can be her prescription, I can be her physician
Sexual healing: I can be her religion
And now, she's kneeling, praying to the ceiling
I bless her as if she sneezed—must be the weather
I dress her: I am her sleeves, I am her feathers
She's fly—flyer than you, flyer than me
I love her; she loves me, too; I love her three times
More than her mom; time will tell that I'm the nigga that
She should—we should be wherever she wanna be on a
Late night, midday, A.M., just say when
And I know I be with cavemen, but never mind them
She's "Poison," and I am Michael Bivins
See, I know that y'all don't hear me, but she does; we does
What grown folk do when they had too much to drink, and I think
We done had too much to drink, and

(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed

Oh, yes, I love her like I ought to
I see you at the altar, Mrs. Carter
I see you with my daughter, or son—more than one
Maybe five, like the Jacksons, or John Paxson
Just don't let 'em fuck up the mansion
And Daddy will be home later on
Smelling like the cologne that I put on this morn
And I hope that you smell like woman's soap and shampoo
And lotion and perfume and candles
And I'ma run through that pussy like a vandal, yes
I'm nasty as a Scorpio, but I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like she's sweating out a fever—wow!
Leave her to me, and she'll be smiling every single time you see her
From ear to ear
I want to be beside her when she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated; panties are debated
Einstein: Her head is the greatest

(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed

Oh, yes, I love her like her dad told her no man would ever love her—oh, and
I better be the only man sticking it
Licking it like an envelope; mailing it, sealing it, read it
I have written down Victoria's Secret—don't tell nobody
Don't share your body with nobody—not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it—that ass for Weezy, baby
And at my station, we have sex orientation
When I hit it, she squint like them Orient Asians; I do me
I say, "Hey, Ms. Chun Li, I like to see your booty—
Roll, like sushi"; I'm tryna dip my celery up in her bleu cheese
"Ah"s, "Ooh-wee"s
"Voila"s, "Ta-da"s, "Mhm"s, "Uh-huh"s
"Oh, yeah"s, never "Oh, no"s until I have to go
And then it's: "Never! Oh, no!" I tell her, "Don't cry—
I be back like the electric bill"
And when she butt-naked, she dressed to kill

(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed

I'm not scared of the dark
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
I'm not scared, not at all
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
I'm not scared
I'm not scared, neither are the stars
I'm not scared of the dark
Of the dark, mmm

Tunechi
I ain't never scared and I ain't never horrified
I just look down at my Rolex, it said it's the darkest times
I ain't never terrified, I ain't never petrified
You know I see dead people, I just tell 'em get a life
I ain't never scurred, I'm not sure if that's a word, but
I meant every word, feelin' like do not disturb, wait
Let me testify, I have never testified
And I'm married to my pride, I ain't never— the bride
I got eyes like marbles, if I cry, they sparkle
You know I can read your mind like I'm the author
There's a line for tomorrow and that line's gettin' shorter
I'm behind the trigger, what if I am the target?
Deep sigh, a sayōnara, I ain't afraid to die
It's either goodbye or good mornin', and the skies start to fallin'
And I'ma shine in the darkness
I look back down at my Rollie, it says time for the chorus
You know I'm not scared

I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, not at all

(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yuh
Okay, put my heart to the side
In my feelings, ****, let's ride
Big MAC to the side
If she call, I'm gon' slide
That my baby, boy, you crazy
She might get a new Mercedes
She say she want me, ooh-wee
Okay, lil' shawty, let's do this, uh-huh

If I could count the tears I've cried
So many times, I swear I've died
I'm trying, but it's still not right
The only time I want her is night

I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, not at all

You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
'Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushin' the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargainin' on cocaine
So in other words, nigga, do your thing

Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who don't have your heart in your rap shit
And got too fuckin' comfy
'Cause we still fuckin' hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin' faded, aw yeah I'm fuckin' faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aw yeah, I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin' all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

Uh, stop playin', I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, Sheneneh, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock .40's, nigga, you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, I'ma need some fuckin' goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real, ho
Lil' Weezyana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I ain't workin' with a full deck but I deal, ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfuckin' field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that "how-much-you-love-your-lady" money
I know you fake, nigga, press your brakes, nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date, nigga
I'm a grown-ass Blood, stop playin' with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’
I think you pussy cat, ha, Hello Kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay 'em down, Tempurpedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think it's cleavage
Its Young Money, yeah, tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meetin'
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop-pop-potato salad

Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms

Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses

Amen, so now instead of pledge, we pray, yeah

President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Reality’s a bitch and I'mma dance with her
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech

Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, 
Thank you, thank you all, I am President Carter

My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

I'm good, I'm not living like I did before

Then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear I'm with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she probably out here fucking niggas
I'm fucking her friends
Now her friends ain't even fucking with her
Damn, she text me all day and night
So pissed off she ain't even spelling shit right
I text her back, and tell her it's life
Now somebody tell them hoes, I'm single for the night

And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

Dreads braided to the back

And my girl acting like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer, I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And when I get home she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, Polo drawers
Now make me take this Polo off
Girl you can get broken off
Yeah, I fuck you for an hour then I smoke it off
Swimming trunks and bathing suits
Then go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight
Man somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the night

And he been fussing all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F Baby-sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up
She say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's about to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single, and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night

Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me

Angel hair at 2AM for Bey and Hov
Just to show 'em how I treat the city like my humble abode
Ayy, tell me if TD Bank is approvin' loans
I'm thinkin' of payin' Wayne what Universal owes
My nigga spent a lifetime goin' platinum and gold
He should own half of the label, shit outta control
Somebody get Larry Jackson on the phone
I need some ownership if we pressin' go
'Cause business is boomin' on behalf of me
I need a bite outta the Apple like Adam and Eve
We gon' have to break the billi' curse
I need my paper long like "A Milli" verse
Or too long like a sentence from a Philly judge
Fuck is the point in all the beefin' when we really blood?
Nobody wins when the family feuds, nigga
Everybody gotta eat, we can't exclude niggas

Build a treehouse and knock the bird nest out that bitch
Stuck my neck out and shit, then got the heck out that shit

Now back to whippin' the baby on some step mama shit
I come direct with my shit, I come correct with my shit
A blank check on your face, put some respek on my shit
Branches startin' to shake, here comes the leaves, get the rake
I want my piece of the cake, it should be sweeter than cake
Here come the leaves, get the rake, and we ain't leavin' the rake
We made the cleanest escape, although I bleeped in your face
You playin' with the right one today
Your flag is a white one today
You wearin' em tight ones today
Check me or write one today
You playin' with fire today
The Angel and Lion are greats
Oh my God, lightning strikin' twice in this place
Should we make a wish or should we make it right in this place?
All this motherfuckin' beef, I need some rice on this plate
Talked to your wifey today, she feelin' triflin' she say
Talked to the sniper, he say he aimin' at diapers today
Pick you off like pickin' peppers, Peter Piper today
So tell your squad I say "BLAOW" like Spice 1 would say
It's Mortal Kombat tonight, it's Street Fighter today
I'm Major Bison, Drizzy lit like Raiden light up the place
You see blue face hundreds 'til you white in the face
Oh my God, it feel like I done life in this place
But swear to God, I got money doin' life in my safe
Put on the gloves like MJ, go from OG to OJ
I make you pay attention then rip your receipt in your face
This for Cita and Nae, this for my people and bae
I got three sons of a gun, them niggas keep me on safe
Hol' up, I am the black god to the church
I am the fat boy to dessert
I am the landlord to the first, got two bangers
One of them go "bada boom," one of them go "bada bing"
I taught these hoes how to love, I taught these boys how to lean
I'm high in the sky and I twinkle, the eyes don't lie 'til you blink 'em
Keep the iron for the wrinkles
The mansion came with the sprinklers
I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
Yeah, you know life is a movie, you niggas playin' yourselves, damn

That's some six shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
It's every man for themselves, it's every baby for sale
And you know life is a movie, you niggas ratin' yourself
I just hope it’s a porn to watch you pussies play with yourself
That's some six shit

Me! That's who

I'm sorry for the wait, I'm sorry for the wait (Tell 'em, tell 'em!)
Tha Carter gon' be late so I cooked up a tape (Tell 'em!)
The garden's full of snakes so I had to escape
Lil homie gon' be straight, lil homie gon' be straight!
Woo! OW!

And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
Yeah, and I'm sorry for the wait, too
I told myself to save yourself
'Cause I can't save you (I can't save you)
I send my goons to kill somebody
I need head proof (I need head proof)
Fuck it (fuck it!) This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
I ain't trippin', I got Barbie, I got Drake too (I ain't trippin'!)
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof (Mula!)
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Boop!

Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who (nigga, me!)
Who was there when niggas left us? Nigga, me, that's who
Cash Money is an army, I'm a one man army (yeah)
And if them niggas comin' for me, I'm goin' out like Tony
(Bap-bap-bap-bap)
Now I don't want no problems
I just want my money (want my money)
Ain't gotta hold no conversation
Nor my luggage (nor my luggage)
Tell whoever's countin' that I'm on a hundred
Woo, Birdman Junior – more like Ugly Duckling

Takin' over, now I'm takin' over, yeah (now I'm takin' over)
Think it over? Bitch, I'm thinkin' forward, ta
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, nigga
All I got is Young Money – no more Cash, nigga, ayy!

And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
No more am I my brother's keeper – Cain and Abel
Young Money sharp, I'm still eatin'
I just chipped my tooth (Mula!)
Tell them niggas – no love lost, 'cause I ain't got shit to lose
I told myself to save yourself
'Cause I can't save you (I can't save you)
I send my goons to kill somebody
I need head proof (I need head proof)
I found the needle in the haystack, put the thread through
I tried to stitch the wound back up, but I just bled through

Yeah, it's compensation over conversation (no more conversation)
Lord, I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces (amen)
Lord, this game is a vampire (woo!)
Blood, you gotta protect your neck
It'll suck you dry like raisins, Lord
But fuck that, nigga, got it drawn out
Fuck that nigga, I'ma ball out
The day you met me is the day Hell froze
On the day I left is when it thawed out (ayy!)
I'm still in the buildin'
I just had to knock a couple walls down, had to kick y'all out (ayy)
Life is a movie, but sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin'
And walk out

Takin' over, Lord I'm takin' over
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga
And all I do is smoke, fuck, and thrash, nigga, ayy!

And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2 (sorry for the wait)
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi – niggas don't appreciate you (don't appreciate you)
You've been down since day one
It meant nothin' on day two (damn)
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow, and to say, too
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school

And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over (takin' over)
The old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over
If so, then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda...

Get high, so high that I feel like lying

Jumping off of a mountain into a sea of codeine

Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Psst!)

I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot
And violets are blue, roses are red
Daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead
Wish I could give you this feeling
I feel like buying
And if my dealer don't have no more
Then (I feel like dying) yeah

Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Switch her whip out, put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest In Peace to Honda

Cocaine on her navel, lick it so my tongue can go HAM
Put my face up in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Make her do the jumpman, ayy
I put her face down in the pillow, 'bout to smother her ass
A fly yellow bone to me, I told her to come get a tan
Now she butter pecan
Oh, I got a Draco in the sofa, an Eggo in the toaster
A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga
And I wake up, smell the Folgers, I don't know how I woke up
'Cause I was in a coma, but now I'm in the moment
Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'
The plug ain't charge me nothin' for it
I cried tears of fuckin' joy
LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Neo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and other things
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And the Nina came, and her sister came
And what's her name, it’ll go Buka Bang
You don't even know where to put the blame, that's cold

I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Got 'em feelin' like they five star, yeah
Your hoes throwin' fits, my bitches patient
Man, I feel just like a doctor, yeah

Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Mazda
Put her ass up in a dumb Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Smart Car
Switch her, put her in Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Kia
Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes

My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh, bitch!

Lay on the bed, open that twat
I French kiss that pussy, like muah
Sit on my face, M-U-A-H
Before I eat that pussy, I say my grace
Girl I'm nastier than him, I don't know why you still with him
Beat that pussy, go to sleep, she got that Tylenol P.M
Fuck that bitch until she tired, 'til she tired like a rim
Give her head like a brim, it tastes good, M-M-M
Pussy monster in her closet, full of surprises
I give full body massages, I hope that pussy smell like a violet
I hope that pussy warmer than luke and sweet as Godiva
Suck this dick and swallow that nut and call it Penis colada
Lift up that mini-skirt, that's my dinner desert
She fell in love with the Martian, I said you too down to Earth
Man, these hoes love Wayne, got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK

Hoping this juice is sweeter than baked cake
She say it's for Tunechi, she lie with a straight face
But I'm trying to eat healthier, so I ate a veggie
Sucked on that pussy, I feel better already
She say "Tunechi go slower" and Tunechi went faster
My tongue is a motor, my dick is a NASCAR
Whipped cream on that pussy, dickhead like a bullet
If her hair real I'ma pull it, hope that ass feel like a cushion
I give her wood when he wouldn't
I hope that pussy tastes like pudding
And I get that ho the boot
Hold up, let me put my foot in, Tunechi!
Got a sweet tooth, candy-yam pussy
I'ma leave that ass smoking like a Amsterdam tourist
Man, these hoes love Wayne
Got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK

This pussy so clean like soap in your mouth
I do my lil' dance, he scoping me out
If that dick like a tree watch me build a treehouse
Ok, the baddest bitch in this bitch, got the fattest clique in this bitch
You might drown, you better start doggy paddling in this bitch
I'm Trin, B nigga? Queen nigga, sleep in this pussy, dream nigga
I stay on that dick like a fucking balance beam nigga
Hair pull, neck grab, don't fuck with hoes that backstab

She going away now, I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models, I said they're nothing but trouble

When I met her, she was out for love
Yeah, I bought her leather and some diamond studs
Damn, when I met her, she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I said "whatever" 'cause I'm not a judge
No, all my niggas say she not what's up
Uh, I considered it but not enough
Uh, she just wanted to be popular
Uh, she just want ten thousand followers
Lord, she posted, she posted, she posted
They like it, they like it, repost it
She party promotin', she hostin'
She posin', legs open, provokin'
It got my head smokin'
I tried to act like I don't notice
Emotions, emotions, emotions, lord

I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She going away now (Now, it's over)
I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble

I had to leave that ho alone and get my mind right
I had to go talk to my friends, I had to find Christ
Lord, I had to open up my eyes and find light
I was so green and all she wanted was that limelight
Lord, I was so blinded by her highlights
She had me not checking my DM's neither my likes
Oh what, you modeling, ma? Knock yourself out
Open my heart to you when you lock yourself out, girl
When I met her, she was posse'd up, yeah
In the section holding bottles up
Oh, she just wanted to be popular
Oh, she just want ten thousand followers

I should have known from the very start
That you weren't after my foolish heart
No, you liar, liar, liar, girl
You got the world thinking you're a star
But oh, you're not who you say you are
No, I'm dying, dying, dying, girl

I'm facing the bottle
(I'm sipping and lighted and dipping in line, but I'm coping)
For all of my problems (I'm too open)
These Instagram models (Glad I left her)
Are nothing but trouble (But I don't know her, Lord)
She going away now (Now, it's over)
I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)

I said they're nothing but trouble

As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon, she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you

Leave a message in the dust just for me

Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’

People livin’ on their rocket ships

Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon? Meet you on the moon?

Intergalactic love

I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you

I'll be waiting, I’ll be waiting for you

My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it; if she stealin', I'ma kill her
I bulletproofed the ride, now I feel like armadillos
And fuck your hospital—Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like C-Y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen, I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a lil' intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm prob'ly in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See, my world is different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing

And you know that I’ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don’t worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
‘Cause the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I’m gon' be in it
The sky is the limit (Errrrrrrr!)

Buck-ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, "Don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free"
And I hate when a nigga say, "Talk is cheap"
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me, yeah
My flow is art—unique, yeah
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is "Eat—
—by any means," and you just sardines
I got the forty-cal' tucked in my P-R-Ps
What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand-new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours

And I'ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And I'ma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit

And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head, or I'll take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting on the living-room sofa—that's fucked up, haha
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head, or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your moms with a dozen of roses
Haha, now that's fucked up
And I'm a G
And you ain't got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit, but I cannot forget the streets

So you know that I'ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Don't worry about mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me, "Don't get high" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing
'Cause the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
If you don't remember nothing, man, the sky is the limit

[Song 45: Typa Way]
96 ContributorsTypa Way Lyrics
My niggas been stuntin' since way back when
CNN, I got news for you haters
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch, I ain't lying
69, that's a favor for a favor

Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take

Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short
I think I love her, it was just a THOT
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, "Tune, not in my mouth," damn you should've said it sooner
I be shittin' on these niggas, like I'm sippin' Metamucil
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like "excuse you"
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my nigga
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead, my nigga
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly
My bitch been fussin' at me about nothin'
Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait
We can't even have a decent conversation

I pop the seal on my sip and she be like, "See, you gon' drink your life away"
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates
I hope that ho don't call sayin' her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face
And she ain't all that pretty, but I like her shape
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a 8
She say she ain't no dyke, but she gon' dyke today
It's curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes
We turnt up niggas, burnt up, stop the microwave
This shit might cost us our life, but that's the price we pay
I'm hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate
This that Dedication 5, whattup 5?

Ay Tune' I gotta turn up on the D5 man!
Hustle Gang, bang, green mean, anybody get it
Anything we'll do for the paper
And we live this shit, talk slick get kill't
Got nothin' but a tool for a hater (Spent 100K on my wrist nigga!)
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)
The car I'm drivin' make you feel some type of way (They can't afford this nigga!)
The cash I gettin' make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)
This type of way, know you feel some type of way (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
That shit ain't hot, we out here poppin' that's all I can say (G.D.O.D!)
My only problem is tryin' to decide what I'mma drive today (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
We shine all in they face, I know they feel some type of way
I wake up in a multi-million dollar crib get dressed I plan on having a nicer day
When these punk ass rappers keep my name in they mouth, like they some type of gay
You know me dog, so watch what you say (You better watch your mouth!)
We ain't playing no games with your lame ass nigga, fuckboy you can die today (I swear you can!)
I keep a chopper in my backseat, actually it's my Glock partner (My Glock, partner!)
Play crazy if you want to, fuck around and get shot partner (Get shot partner!)
I don't like these niggas, and really fuck these niggas
Talk crazy in ya raps if you want, when you see me you won't touch me nigga! (Won't touch me niggas!)
Ball all around in my flip flop, you think TIP soft? Well then why don’t you try me
If you really gon' be dramatic, we gon' to need some music, they queuein' the violin
I'm talking slow singing, flower bringing
Empty a clip in you earing, and you chest thing, and you out the door
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)
The car I’m driving make you feel some type of way (They can’t afford this nigga!)
The cash I get it make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)

We fall asleep naked, we wake up naked
You know what that means, pussy for breakfast
And I know how she likes it, I'm a psychic
I eat it then I go back to sleep, that's that "itis"
And she be by herself she a loner
Trukfit, I'm the owner
I make her moan, call her Mona
I'd have a threesome if they cloned her
And me I'm purple kush forever
I'm purple drank forever
That dick make her feel retarded
She say I make her feel special
When I ain't thinking 'bout them other hoes
Ever since you put that pussy on me
I told her put that pussy on me right
And I'mma change your life
And don't sit on top of this dick if you're scared of heights

And shawty be like
This pussy for you
I ask her is it true? And she say like a horseshoe
She got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
She lay me on my back and ride this dick like "vroom"
Then I turn on the lights, yeah
And look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight
You need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid
She a plus, first aid
They ask me what’s her race and I say first place
Tunechi
Tell her I skate
And shawty down to earth but bitch I need my space
And she gon' ride this dick, I had a long day
She say cum anywhere you want, I give her Santa Clause face
We gon' turn up tonight

That pussy feel new
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
And now she got a man I think he gayer than a stylist
I wish we were both single like a couple dollars
And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other up, like some Somalians
She know I got a girl but she keep this shit a thousand
Whenever we together she don't ever ask about her

She just be like
This pussy for you
I say come and eat this bone and stop eating dog food
And she got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
And she lay me on my back and then she blow me like boom
Then I turn on the lights, yeah
Then look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight, you need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid, she a plus, first aid
I put her in her place and that's first place
Tunechi
Tell her I skate
I ain't got no worries, no Frank Ocean I'm straight
Tunechi, tell 'em I'm straight

Shout to Chi-Town!
Dedication 5!
Since '05!
Know that!
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass with your fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with your breasts showing
Like a salad, no dressing, take you to your favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread, then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when your ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
And I'ma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
'Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it, I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy, coffee
Brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait, it wasn't
Oh, and I forgot, I'll take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen
My homeboy like your sister, maybe they can bake some cousins
Ooh, isn't that sweet?
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass

This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see, I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter—better yet, sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, "I-I love you too"
It's Wayne's world, she say, "What is this world coming to?"
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, "Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
"What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate, we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear, I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of... my memory ain't what it used to be"
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...

This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?
I loved the pictures
I needed that, I swear I did
I was just thinking about you when you sent them too
You don't believe me? I know
D5, what up 5?
I-I love you too...I do

I'm so on it, and however you want it
You can get it tonight ho, and all night ho
I get the beat from (Maestro), a-fuckin' right, ho!

I might go crazy on these niggas, I don't give a motherfuck
Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up
What! What! I don't give a motherfuck
Get your baby kidnapped and your baby-mother fucked
It's Tha Carter 3, bitch, better put your supper up
Hollygrove, I throw it up like I'm trying to lose my gut
Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level? You can't get on my level
You gon' need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick
Bitch, swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could've died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches, like Magic
Abracadabra, I'm up, like Viagra
I just do this shit for my clique, like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop, and I'ma keep it on my channel
Watch me! Bitch, watch me! Bitch, watch me!
But they cannot-see me, like Hitler
It's the New Orleans nightmare
Money so old, it's growing white hair
Young Money, baby! Yeah, we right here
I'ma make sure we ball 'til we fall like tears
And mama, don't cry, your son can handle his
I got her out the hood and put up in the hills, yeah
When I was fourteen, I told my mom we would see better days
And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was fourteen, I told my mom we would see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said
I tell my girl, "When you fuck me, better fuck me good
'Cause if another girl could, she gon' fuck me good"
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it
Yeah, I got game like Stuart
Scott, fresh out the ESPN shop
And when SportsCenter poppin', everything stoppin'
But you can't fool me, I know what you watchin'

Me! You watch me!
You watch me! 'Cause I be
Weezy, must-see TV, C3

I'm me, times three
So retreat, or suffer defeat
I'm back, 3-Peat!

Sleepin' at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly 'til you swat 'em
But who am I to talk? I ain't shittin' roses
We in the same picture, but we all got different poses
Now I'm looking in my rearview, I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear-ended
Pause, like a red light, I'm dead right
Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
They say you don't know what you doin' 'til you stop doin' it
Well, call me clueless, 'cause I do this
Attention all shooters, I'm a shooting star
Life is a course and I'ma shoot for par
Searchin' for today, instead, I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back, man, I'll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money, CMR, Blood like a scar
Weezy F. Baby and the F ain't for "Flaw"

Uh
Uh
Yep, yep
Yep, yep

It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standin' in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleepin' on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold, I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doin' with it?
Keep openin' your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
I know my shit already tight, so I ain't screwin' with it
Some say this game is a joke, well, I hope they get it
Okay, I'm walkin' on needles, stickin' to the point
Yeah, the streets is talkin', I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangster by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't call me sir, call me survivor

Uh
Yeah
Uh
Haha
And it go
Yep, yep
Yep, yep

Uh, call me killer 'cause I make a killin'
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you could call 'em siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let 'em be, 'cause you know how that sting'll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track, train derail
Know how to roll, never need trainin' wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing, all, nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches and a cup of wealth
And the F is for "Fuck yourself"

Uh
Yeah

And I ain't doing nothing but gettin' my share, breathin' this air
And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I'm feelin' alright, I'm tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer
I'm trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear

Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life ain't shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to God 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea
Motherfucker it's on, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong
Put a bug in my ear, but not in my phone
I'll have a broke motherfucker run in your home
For a crumb and a bone
And put —

One in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome

My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itching, nigga

I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
You ain't gon hurt nobody like Kid 'n Play
Ain't nothin' sweet but the codeine, nigga
Eyes hella red like chlorine in 'em
I was gettin' that pussy, I was gettin' that money
Long hair, don't care, Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Too high to take a breath, too high to take a step
Two rights don't make a wrong, three rights make a left
The cops on my dick, the feds on my nerves
I walk it like I talk it, got legs on my words
If she don't suck dick I don't give her that dick
Got the world in my hands, I'mma dribble that bitch
Money is the issue, full court pressure
I like my blunt Nutty Professor
I'm a straight rider with a getaway driver
Hit you dead on the money, now you dead on arrival
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends
But never too rich for new money
These niggas buying Haterade by the twelve pack
Like two stomachs
I'm laced up like two shoes, Miss Goody
Keep that ratchet, nigga
Trigger finger itchin', I'll scratch it, nigga
Blow your fuckin' brains out in traffic, nigga
Got green, New Orleans, St. Patrick, nigga
One bitch in the whip, one on the phone
The one on the phone is in front of your home
She 'bout to run in your home and put —

Rest in peace to the game, tell them kill they self
Make your death wish, 'cause I'm too fresh

You go broke tryna get fresh like this
Rest in peace to the game 'cause I killed it
I'm fresh to death, I'm fresh to death
What you talkin', I came out a coffin
Yeah

I just can't see myself
Living in a house of mirrors
I bought me a double-R
'Cause I went from rags to riches
And these niggas nag like bitches
Actin' like little fags like Richard
And all of my bitches be bad as vision
You got a problem
I can fix it like a mathematician
I am-munition
Call me ammo for short
Trukfit shirt, camo the shorts
Your girl is a freak, your man is a narc
With your son in your arms
I'll put —
One in your dome

Ah-em

Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, "You're a son of a gun"
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, "I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, "Nothing's easy"
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, "Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious"
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, "Y'all young. You know y'all young." But I said, "Be the best father you can be," you know. And truly, he is that.

[Song 52: Back to You]
83 ContributorsBack to You LyricsWeezy engages in some “sexual warfare.”
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you
And I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you, back-back

She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs
She ride me like a drive-by, I'm real, these niggas sci-fi
But that's neither here nor there, she been contemplatin' short hair
She said she tryna be different but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes I'm hoein', but she the only one worth knowin'
And yeah, I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in
I ain't tripping, but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffing
Look, girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'm a dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say, "Okay, I'm your honor"
But she been wanting to break up since Dolce and Gabbana
All that ass, I just be like, "Come sit your groceries on my counter"
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it Tijuana
I'm dying to meet her girl, but she want me to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9
The weed is funky, but I'm smelling fine
Tunechi

Now, I know (Woah!) the only compass that I need (I'm putting my hat back on)
Oh, is the one that leads back to you (She said)
Now, I know the only compass that I need (Yeah)
Oh, is the one that leads back to you

Uh, I got that shit in my system, somebody gon' be my victim
Eh, so where you at with it? 'Cause I can't do it by myself, I need a ass-sistant
I got that good-good, that get right, that early morning, that midnight
I beat it up like a fist fight: one, two, three, four, five, 6-9
That dick all in your windpipe, some of her friends I dislike
Some of your friends, they alright, sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one, don't wanna be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue, my third leg run marathons
I feel you like I'm blind, girl, can't you see? It's meant to be
So come to me, then come for me, my game cold, one degree
I'm rolling with two bad bitches 'cause misery loves company
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, just get to Lil Tunechi

Now, I know (Woah!) the only compass that I need (I'm putting my glasses back on)
Oh, is the one (Yeah!) that leads back to you (She said)
Now, I know (Now, I know) the only compass that I need (Get to me baby)
Oh, is the one (You need to get to me, baby) that leads back to you
(I'm waitin', yeah)

Uh, should I call somebody else?
'Cause girl, it's almost 12 and this dick won't suck itself
Girl, you know it need some help, it'd make a nigga's day
If you said you on your way, ayy, ayy
Should I call somebody else?
'Cause girl, it's almost 12 and this dick won't suck itself
Girl, you know it need some help, it'd make a nigga's day
I just hope you know the way
And she said

Now, I know (Woah!) the only compass that I need (I'm putting you back on)
Oh, is the one (That's right) that leads back to you (And she said)
Now, I know the only compass that I need (Get to me baby)
Oh, is the one (You need) that leads back to you (To get to me)
That leads back to you
(But you already got to me)

Faded off the kush, I'm gone
Only two years old when daddy used to bring them hookers home
Looking like my grandma, my niggas got that ammo
We jack-son and then light up the L, Samuel
Tunechi in this bitch, nigga, y'all niggas bitch niggas
Rats gon' rat, and snakes gon' hiss, nigga
Baseball rich, nigga, do this shit for all my homies
Where them bad bitches at? Come and put that pussy on me
Tunechi, you a murderer, boy, you just be killing shit
Yeah, you know that money talk, I am the ventriloquist
Tranquilizer in the trunk, put your ass to sleep, man
Birdman Junior, got the world in my wingspan
How you niggas want it? Have it your way, Burger King
I get deep in that pussy, dig her out, surgery
Fucking with a real nigga, fucking right, certainly
Break in your fucking home, take your life, burglary
Whoa, nigga, die slow, nigga
For dear life you're holding on, En Vogue, nigga
Unload, nigga, reload, nigga
Tools on deck, Home Depot, nigga
Well, if life is a bitch, then mine a gold digger
Yeah, and all my bitches nasty, like a cold dinner
Every day I go so hard and work my ass off
I'm good, I'm 100, like a fastball
It's Carter IV

Yeah!
Ugh!
I'm going back in, man
Yeah

We get fuck y'all money, how you wanna play it?
That AK sleep on the side of my bed
That's one eye closed, one eye open
Your cap get peeled, like ibuprofen
I'm sick, I'm ill, I ain't the nigga to fuck with
It's a crazy world, and life is shorter than Bushwick
Young Money, man, we got this shit by a land slide
Boy, I send them Bloods at your ass, like a tampon
Uptown shit, wet the whole party
Weezy gon' ball, bal' like Steve Harvey
The heater, I'ma tuck her; Tucker like Delores
That's my word, word like thesaurus
I don't see no future in your fronting, I be stunting hard
Rap game dependent on me, like a bungee cord
Fear nobody, but God almighty
Shoot that motherfucker 'til I get arthritis
I'm a beast, I'm a ass, I'm ahead of my class
I'm a diamond in the rough, like a baby in the trash
I don't talk it, I live it; I paint a picture, vivid
And them pistols popping, like they sitting in a skillet
I go so hard, go so mean, I'm so New Orleans
Told the judge I couldn't budge, it was him or me
Forget the bullshit and remember me

[Song 54: Swag Surf]
119 ContributorsSwag Surf LyricsA remix of the F.L.Y. “Swag Surfin” original.
KE on the Track
No Ceilings
Ah...
O—OK

I got this chrome on this Bugatti, I'm strong in this Bugatti
Two V8s, ain't no such thing as driving calm in this Bugatti
Bitch, I’m bad, I'm worse, I'll pass the purp
Don't fuck with me 'cause right now, I'm higher than Captain Kirk
I swear, I be the sickest nigga, you can ask the nurse
And if you throw it in a bag I bet I'll snatch her purse
OK, I spaz, I curse; you last, I'm first
I'm on your ass, like dirt; behind that cash, get murked
I'm talking big shit, nigga, join my hit list, nigga
What's the matter? Check your bladder, I'm the shit, piss, nigga
Shoot the witness, nigga
Hold court in the streets and convict this nigga
Ol' dickless nigga
Man, I'm running with the blocka, Young Money, motherfucker
You think we gon' do our thing? Well, ain't it sunny in the summer?
And we coming for the commas, and whoever among us
And you know I'ma bust my ass until my crew very humongous
I said, T.I., hold your head, and Mack, hold your head
Wish I could but I can't say some other names 'cause of the Feds
And to my Bloods, code red, man, you know how we play it
And if it costs to be the boss, oh well, I guess I gotta pay
I—I'm a New Orleans nigga, I don't take no shit
Take the brain off the whip; now, it don't make no sense
Stunt hard on these bitches, I ain't promised tomorrow
Now, women kicking it with me like Nomar Garciaparra
Fuq' roll them killer plants, the Little Shop of Horror
And we roll them bitches thick, make 'em look like Toccara
Man, I'm too much for these niggas and three much for these hoes
The world is in my hands, and I keep my hands closed
I love my baby mamas, they get my highest honor
Gotta take care of them kids, man, I know you heard Obama
And I live on an island, Atlantic in my backyard
I just tell my pilot to land it in my backyard
Quarterback, shotgun, you don’t get any sack yards
Bitch, I ball hard, breaking all the backboards
Pretty Boy Floyd, step up, I will crack yours
And even at the White House, we pull up at the back doors
Walk around like I'm 30 feet tall
Tiger Woods, all these hoes tryna birdie these balls
In the Porsche 911, like emergency calls
Man, I just be chilling, I'm cool like Lou Rawls
Young Money in the building, I'm putting up new walls
Nigga take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws
My flow is like rubbing two logs
Young Mula, we the new shit, new drawers, ugh
Now, get off my dick, I ain't fucking with you
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol
Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston
Redbone do me good, then her friend assist her
I mean, a bitch she never met, her best friend, or sister
I leave the pussy micro-soft like Windows Vista
Young Tunechi, pop that coochie for a goon, ho
Bullet in you boys' memory, now you act like you don't know
Eastside who I do it for, Eagle Street, right by the store
Katrina wiped the city out but couldn't fuck with Hollygrove
Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But Heaven or Hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'ma go
Take a nigga gal and make her come give me a private show
Still "long hair, don't care" like a Navajo
I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search
I smash this verse, and I swag and surf

No Ceilings!

[Song 55: Watch My Shoes]
83 ContributorsWatch My Shoes LyricsInsanely hot track off of Lil Wayne’s 2009 mixtape No Ceilings. Straight lyricism, no hooks.
OK, No Ceilings, motherfucker, good morning
Dick in your mouth while you're yawning, I'm going in
Gudda, why they started me? Marley, why they started me?
I bring it to your front door like you ordered me
Back in this bitch, but a lot more rich
On my Papa Bear shit, need hot porridge
Got a lot more shit than you can ever fathom
A big-head nigga couldn't even imagine
The shit I do, most doers never done
I'ma fuck this beat, you bitch, ooh, you better cum
Bet I run this shit, I don't run from shit
I still b-beat your ass like a fucking drumstick
Weezy Fucking Baby, baby, make the ladies come quick
The money can't fit in my pockets, but I'll bet that gun fit
And I'm so unfit 'cause all I eat is rappers
And these rappers ain't shit, I like my fast food faster
Syrup got me slow like a turtle 'round this ho
And I'm flyer than the highest-flying bird around this ho
What's the word around this ho? You get served around this ho
Yeah, you get served like a fucking hors d'œuvre around this ho
I don't splurge around no ho, no, I don't shine in front of no bitch
'Cause after she get off my dick, I be like "Find the front door, bitch"
I don't know why in the fuck your bitch keep coming by
I done fucked your bitch a hundred times
What the fuck your bitch got on her mind? My fucking dick
I call her "dickhead," spicy like a Big Red
Strike you like a Bic head—your flow sick? My shit dead
Sillier than V.I.C. said, Soulja Boy and Arab
You should see my eleven-year-old daughter do they dance
I call it the Nae-Nae dance, proud to be Nae-Nae's dad
Gun on the waistline, leave you in the wasteland
We are not the same, I am a Martian, this is Space Jam
No Ceilings, R.I.P., Amen
Motherfucking caveman, beating on my chest
Young Money, Cash Money, and I'm eating all the rest
Nigga, no offense, sorry if you're offended
Riding high like I'm on 54 inches
Man, I'd rather chill with 54 bitches
Ch—Chill like— Ch—Chill like an Eskimo
L—Let's get more— Let's get more bitches
And I be like, "Let's get more bitches"
Mr. Officer, stop arresting your bitches
Stop letting the messy hoes mess with your business
Mickey Mouse cheese, hip-hop Walt Disney
Sheesh, gosh, Oshkosh B’gosh
Smoking on that Bob Marley, listening to Pete Tosh
I—I—I do me; no, I do three
At a T... I-M-E
Why, when we say we Young Mula
The bitches leave y'all and relay-run to us
And payday comes sooner than later 'round here
And you see my sharks like they got some bait around here
Hey, you better stop the hate around there
Before Tommy, Mac, and Nina debate around there, yeah
You see it in my face, I don't care
Whole court hearing, trial, and the case around there
I'm the best thing yet, I know I got that thing wet
Everybody wan' be fly but don't know where their wings at
Huh, had to pause for a minute
Now, I'm right back in it, like the drawers of the women
On a scale of one to ten-n, my girl be a twenty
My girl so bad, make a nigga think he sinnin'
My goons so gritty, my goons is so with me
Haters gotta go on iTunes to go get me
Gators, matadors, baboons, and those grizzlies
All come out me when I'm on the micropho-N-E
Mic check, two-three; I am different like blue pee
And my girls be half-naked like Betty Boop be
Like a hoopty, man, the boy been riding
And I ain't gassed up, 'cause I'm more like a hybrid
You think I'm stunting, but no, I'm just surviving
And I been here, but my soul is just arriving
Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin
No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribing
Medication free, and for meditation, we
Smoke some better tastin' weed that you'll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P as a tack, hotter than
Riding through the desert on a camel back, I done been
Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that
So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack
And we cook the hard, cut the soft, and bring the whammys back
Mafio, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?
Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back
All up in another nigga woman, I be ramming that
Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate
Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it
And I'm such a philanthropist, the God to these evangelists
I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami, though
I act so New Orl-e-ans, yes, I go pistachios
That means I go nuts on any beat they throw at me
And the bitches is so at me, and you know what they throw at me
Hahaha!

No—No Ceilings

You know I've been talkin' shit for a generation now
'Bout that time for me to kick my feet up
Y'know? Move on to other endeavors
Who's ready to take the torch?
Somebody? Anybody?
Haven't I taught you everything?

When this shit dropped, I was like 16
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing, big dreams
Say goodbye to ripped jeans, nigga got a job
Had my little wad, worst fear was getting robbed
For my last 50 dollars that I had left over
Five dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder
Minimum wage, $5.15
13s on the whip, kept my shit clean, uh
Actually that was my mama shit
But I'm drivin' 'round town on my Obama shit
Middle-class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But yeah, I'm headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game but I got a lot of lip
That's why them niggas don't like me and always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth most likely
Uh, I know the game, I'm an expert
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?
Nigga I'm gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone
And I ain't fuck yet 'cause her mama always home
God damn, L-Lord have mercy
Please God, don't let this little broad have herpes
My nigga say she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Gold medals if we gave hoes medals
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos
Spiderman sheets, got her singing falsetto
Tall white tee's, can't believe we used to wear those
White folks looking at us like we're weirdos
But we was only kiddos
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of Skittle
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle
Tryna get to Diddy 'cause I murder instrumentals
This that good old fashioned Mark Jackson
Fucked then I'll pass, y'all Utah Jazz-in'
Ya borin', I don't play nigga, I'm Mark Madsen
That's why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian
I'm not askin', my nigga I don't need favors
I'm in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger
My team major, we party like teenagers
I'm in the green Range, nigga I'm the Green Ranger
I fucking ran outta breath, heh
Team major, we party like teenagers
I'm in the green Range, nigga I'm the Green Ranger
Cole

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't even like this beat but fuck it
I'ma only spit a few bars 'cause I don't like this beat, let's go

Uh, bitch I'm not old news, I'm more like gold shoes
She eat my whole dick, she like Whole Foods
They say I'm old school, but I dropped out
Drop ya body off, at a cop's house
They throwin' up them bricks, you better box out
My niggas got enough white to build Barack house
I got my drawers on, Sam Rothstein
.44 on my waist, Rick Ross jeans
I've been faded, stone wash jeans
New pussy, new money, New Orleans
50 up in that uzi, G-G-G-G-Unit
I murk you with that bitch, scratch the serial number, re-use it, uh
I'm from the N-O, stretch niggas out like limo's
Uzi go zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit, that's pimples, uh
I'm 'bout to go banana puddin', hehe
You a dyke 'cause your man a pussy
Hit you from the blindside, no Sandra Bullock
Never bite the hand that feeds you
Always watch the hand that's cookin'
Tunechi

The greatest mixtape series of all time
Uh-uh-uh-mmmm
Care to debate me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sick shit
I thought so

Keep that shit on Twitter
Y'all ain't lit, y'all litter
Keep that shit in your shitter
Or eat that shit, don't spit up, rrr!
Keep my bad bitch did up
Keep my main bitch put up
Watchin' me do push-ups
She was playin' with herself and I looked up, damn
Your thot need to get her look up, ugh
You're plottin' on me, my foot up, ugh
Your squad ain't hard, that's cushion, ugh
That ain't sauce, that's pudding, ugh
Tunechi 'cross her bosom, damn
Shooting up the jurors, damn
Don't name my pistol
I named the trigger "Benjamin Button"
Push him, bam!
Y'all just pussy, get buried together and let 'em play footsie
Y'all just wussy, I got some bullies
Gon' pull up in hoodies and come take a look-see
Better play hooky, I got some hookers hookin' up with politicans
And some athletes, and some college niggas
Send your missus on all kind of missions
I'm the sickest nigga skippin' doctors visits
But my pots is pissy, smokin' hockey sticky
Put a stockin' on my face and hit a lick and
When the shit get ugly, I go Pretty Ricky
I don't fuck with rats, neither Minnie, Mickey
I don't fuck with cops, that's the piggly-wiggly
Fuck my bitches' friends, and they friendly-friendly
While your bitch is giving me her twenty-twenty
Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, J.C. Penney's
I got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winning, win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to business, and we laugh at sentencing
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artist or a starving artist
In the kitchen, restaurant, and cafeterias
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Better pay the difference to the racketeerers
Now your good luck looking like you cracking mirrors
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples?
With an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
With a throat deep enough to land a missile
If your nigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now we at his villa aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles
And the cash, it triple; flip, kick, jiujitsu
Throwing pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neither of her friends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than The Simpsons
And her man a simper, so I had to pimp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec, I'll go at your neck
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrr!
Yeah, cannibalism, going animalistic in a land of civilians
These niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug Sicilian
He the one who told me that sometimes
You gotta leave your la familia behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got their eyes wide, but too blind to see it
With friends like those, it make me text all my enemies
And tell 'em I don't need 'em
Hallelujah, power intruders
Bitch walking 'round my house like Hooters
Towel user, power user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan
Niggas talking out their bowel movers
Turn their homies into flower choosers
Turn your kids into father choosers
Make your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo you
Tell a doc that's tryna save your life and running wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let her partner shoot it
We put out the movie, win awards
She got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty
Niggas prostituting
These rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
En route to Houston with the contribution
Full of Monster juices, Mazda too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrr!
I got a Greek freak, she call me Antetokounmpo
Just follow the coupe, ho, and I know that you know
I'm hotter than soup, she still swallow my soup bowl
I'm out of my loophole, you out of the loop though
Got all these niggas on silent and mute mode
The power to do so, my pockets is sumo
Getting the mula by the minuto
Mafia Nouveau, I am the uno
Real boss nigga, should model for Hugo
Fuck with me, I go Lollapaloo-zo
Pull up, trigger finger, holler, and pull-o
Pow-pow-pow, sound like a symphony
Or opera, two-door, hitting some new notes
And I am the maestro, and you just a typo
Private flight, don't fly in too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school flow
I got me a new ho, and now it's a duo
One went to college and one went to JuCo
I had to ask 'em, "What's four plus two, though?" Rrr!

My ultimate basketball dream team
The starting five would most likely be umm
Of course I'ma have to start with Kobe Bryant, umm
This gone take a minute, umm, Chris Paul
Uhh, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James
And umm, oh you know I'm gon say Steph Curry, hehe, Steph Curry
You already know that's my starting five, I got money on them
Holla at ya boy

Don't buck, nigga, don't stunt, nigga
Don't duck, nigga, 'cause I duck hunt

Emergency room, rushed over
Hollow tips in the clip
My gun loaded, yours sober
I pull your card like a lawn mower
Fall back or I'm goin' forward
I see you got your gun drawn
I'll send you back to the drawin' board
Lil Tunechi

See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
You don't talk back, when I cock back
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
Yeah!

Walking 'round this motherfucker limpin'
'Cause the nose on the pistol 'bout as long as Scottie Pippen's
On the molly and I'm twisted, throw your body with the fishes
Double back around that corner and embodyin' the witness
Uh, real niggas don't talk much, do drive-by's and walk-up's
Lame rappers that talk tough get a broke jaw, star-struck
I don't fuck with lame niggas, I got good aim, nigga
Pop a pill, pop you, my nickname is Pain Killer
I'm still that same nigga; Eastside, I rep that
Pussy niggas better get right, or where I see you, you get left at
Use the rifle as my crutch, that's my gun walk
Or we can hold a conversation, let the guns talk
Gudda

I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
And it's no talkin' back when it go off
You speechless, you speechless
I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
You speechless, you speechless
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
You speechless, you speechless
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
You speechless, you speechless - when I cock back

See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk

On God, Dedication 6
On God, Dedication 6
On God, yeah

25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And, bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful when you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrian

You bought a car for the bitch
I buy the narcs for the bitch
You buy apartments and shit
It's nice, I just walked in this bitch
You buy the art for the bitch
Y'all argue too often and shit
You always startin' some shit
That should come off of the bench
Shout out my homies I miss
Nino and Tony and Mitch
This ain't no cordial shit
She wan' come snort all this shit
She wan' go hard with a bitch
She know what happens today
She know we always forget
And she just posted the shit
And he just saw his lil bitch
Tell him I want him to trip
Tell him my guns gettin' skinny
Tell him they're starvin' for this
Give me the check, give me the throne
My hair is a minute too long
My bitch look like Vivica-Berry
Your bitch look like Rosetta Stone
I made my bitch go get a clone
Fuck 'em together and then on they own
When they catch feelings, I’m gone
I'm whippin' the Winnie the Coupe
I'm drivin' and sippin' the soup
The shit made me drift in the coupe
As long as I get to the stu'
Ruler clip, Rick the Ruler slick
Pull up on your bitch, you just called your bitch
Got that "Who is this?" She don't know you exist
She on her Mula shit, that's that truer shit
Make you eat your words, make you chew your shit
Then we knockin' out every tooth you pick
Nigga, fuck you, and fuck who you with
Yeah my bitch broke, but her booty fixed
Wait, I just popped a Perc, another for dessert
I washed it down with syrup
I just left planet Earth, ran into Captain Kirk
I pop a Perc, I'm trippy, call me Perc Nowitzki
Just call her Lewinsky; blurry, blurry vision
Blrrp— "Hello, who is this?" I just hit the line
I got a bitch in mind, I call her anytime
She taller, but it's fine, together we 6-9
I hit her other line, he like, "What other line?"
She like, "Never mind," and she can tell a lie
And I can tell she's lyin', that's no lie
That's my awesome lil bitch
Got me a saucy lil bitch
Got me a bossy lil bitch
Left her for a bossier bitch
It cost me a arm and a dick
I got me a naughtier bitch
She suck on the balls and the stick
I'm about to play golf with the bitch
I'm way on Mars with the bitch
She fuckin' with Martians and shit
You shoppin' at Marshall's and shit
And yeah, your bitch gettin' trippy with me
Want a quickie with me
Say she wish that I had Nicki with me
Say she'd lick her with me
Wish you wish I had my nigga with me
Bitch, you washy-wishy, y'all can't trick me
She said "God, forgive me"
I say "Nah, I'm busy"

I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 bank accounts
Plus a main account, with insane amounts
That's somethin' to think about
Plus the drank in route, now I'm hangin' out
With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 bitches ready to drink me down
Ready to drink me down, ready to drain me out
Plus my main in town, and she came around
Said they ain't her style

25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful when you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrians
(Err!)

Six shit, on God
Dedication 6 on God
Dedication 6 on God
That's some sick shit
Oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Yes Lord
Dedication 6 yes Lord
Dedication 6 yes Lord

[Song 60: U.O.E.N.O.]
86 ContributorsU.O.E.N.O. LyricsU.O.E.N.O. is an acronym for the phrase “You Don’t Even Know it”, which is a repeated phrase in this song.
Uh, I'm flying private through Cloud 9
Yeah, if you got a problem, I'm Einstein
Yeah, I'm yawnin', I'm so tired of ballin'
Yeah, only selling work to them workaholics
Got guns bigger than you nigga, I don't fuck with new niggas
I blues your bitch ass, hope somebody give you rhythm
I got animal all in my floor, take your shoes off at the door
Niggas feed these bitches lies, nigga don't food poison my ho
I buy my drugs for the low, like a coupon on at the store
My niggas like Kanye with that good, my niggas like Lou Rawls with that blow
Niggas be sayin' they racked up, don't let that Q-ball leave you broke
I know you want a pat on the back, but then those fools goin' see you choke
I saw your bitch and she said, she tryin' to move on and let go
Boy, I get up in that pussy and hit her with moves you don't even know
Niggas be trippin' over these hoes, I done came too far to get close
I've been outchea gettin' bread and I don't need you all in my loaf
If you stick your neck out there, I'll have my goon's all at your throat
Niggas be lukewarm at the most and when I'm through ballin' I coach
Shout out to my nigga Mack gettin' his boo on in that Ghost
I'm still coming off the top of the dome but it'd be on a tombstone if I wrote, Tunechi

My kids already rich and they don't even know
These nigga's sayin' they playa's, they ain't even scored
My bitch rolling my weed, she don't even smoke
Everybody following me, I ain't even Moses, nigga

Uh, my cologne illegal in nine countries
I found a way like it was hiding from me
Yeah, my weed good, my sex better
Bitch, don't text me no long letters
I'm ahead of the game, I need a blowjob
Most of these hoes ain't got no job
And these niggas goin' buy em' everything
You goin' fuck around, and get the ho robbed
I'm ahead of the game, I need a haircut
Used to hug the block, I mean bear hug
And tell them rats the AK go rat-a-tat, like snare drums
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard, dick harder than a armadillo
MLK would be proud of me, 'cause I do this shit for all my niggas
Her mouth, pussy, or asshole, life is full of hard decisions
If she ain't fuckin', she get the boot
Let me write this bitch a parking ticket
Ain't got time for love life, all I know is get paid
I'm high like Bonjour, twisted like french braids
I got my own shoes, SLIME, T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift, man, these niggas been dead

Uh, I feel asleep in that pussy and I didn't even know
I woke up and acted like I didn't even know her, yeah
Don't fuck with these fuck niggas, you already know us
I'm looking for that loud pack, weedman bring the noise, yeah

Pass that weed to the next nigga, blunt longer than a tongue twista
Hoes want this scud missile, I'mma ball, like Crystal
Lil Tunchi Li, young sex pistol, new money, no wrinkles
I'm hard-headed, Ocho, Dedication Cinco, uh

What up, 5?
Rocko fuck with me! Yeah!
Future fuck with me! Yeah!
T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these niggas been dead

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
That's all I can do mama
The love I'm sending
An't making it through to your heart
I hope you hear me

Pain! Since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horseshoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me
Sayin' that you forgive me, give me another chance
I'm needin' it like a kidney, I don't wanna advance
Give me back her hands, give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
But everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
'Cause, um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster... BANG!

You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
I see you hidin' it, mama
You got it down, and you're well on your way to the top
Keep doin' your thing
But there is something that you forgot

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me, you are the brightest star under sunlight
See, take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
See, this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap
You've been hiding (Y'know)
Never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin', it mama)
To keep it under control (But I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)
And you're well on your way to the top
But I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness, shawty

But I hope you haven't forgot about me—
Up in the living room, watchin' SportsCenter
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver; you know, they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me "butter," I called you "babe"
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, and let me say:
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, damn!

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart

Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Uhh

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

Find out where your parents stay
Tell my goons to go straight to your momma room
What's in your pockets? What's in your pocketbook?
We think the Bible's a comic book
Bitch this Hollygrove, too far from Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
I got cocaine that's so good, need a name? Call it "Milk"
Because milk does the body good
I got this heat on my waist
So somebody better monitor the thermometer
I just eat pussy and pussy-ass niggas all day
And I ain't even kinda full

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

Woo! I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills
Show me your tits
I'll show you my weapon and grill and heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom
She lay down and say, "Let's make a film"
I be like, "Action," I hold her head down by her neck
This how breathtaking feel
Family first, you'll get your family killed, that's if you squeal
Pop-pop, close range, hold that gun
Like the photographer hold the camera still
Bad bitch riding my dick
She swerve 'cause another bitch grabbing the wheel
I ask 'em to chill, they both look at me, say "Shut up"
I say "My lips are sealed..."
Oooh! I come from Hollygrove, I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in Heaven
When Hell was a pile of wood
I run through Hell with gasoline drawers on
Stop, tell the Devil that God is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop Azure
Vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove, every day Halloween
We shoot your block up and just say we shot a scene
This is a robbery, I let the chopper squeeze
Turn you to cottage cheese
Been on my beast since I was wearing Wallabees
Where paparazzi? I need my privacy
Fuck your photography, I react violently
Make sure your camera get my good side of me, Lord!
I come from Hollygrove
Hollywood should make a movie 'bout Hollygrove
Woo! Whoever play me
Should get a Oscar and a Golden Globe
This ain’t no movie, this is real shit
I don’t need a script 'cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed
All she could snort, more coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets
But got "superstar" written all over my face
That's why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove
I moved to Hollywood just to Californicate
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
I ain't finished shooting, tell 'em don't check the gate

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Fall asleep to the gunshots
Wake up and smell the embalming fluid
I come from Hollygrove, my bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her she say "Hallelujah!"
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood
Ohh, but I done went Hollywood

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Hollygrove ain't far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying
"Lord please don’t let this car break down"
Hahahaha
H-Town! Lord, I done went from Hollygrove to H-Town
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th Ward bitch that be boostin'
Sometimes she doze off, that’s the lean, I excuse it
She said "If it ain't ch-chopped and screwed, it ain't music"
She say I never take her out, we went to eat at Houston's
Sometimes I doze off, that's the lean, I'm just snoozin'
I still got Actavis, nigga, that's exclusive
Kill you for a pint, that's a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
I'm gon' nail all them hoes, I'm Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life, had to do this for Houston
Hollygrove ain't far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with the work
Praying the car don’t break down
Ohhh, Hollygrove ain’t far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth
With, codeine, cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah, and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over you don't give police no names
Or get killed and never found
Word, but I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught
They gon' put me under the jailhouse
Damn, I'm too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with this chopper
Leave you with just arms and a head like a octopus
I got this chopper protecting my livelihood
I'm so good, I'm so straight, I'm secure

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

102 ContributorsHustler Musik LyricsServing as the second single, “Hustler Musik” is possibly the best track off Lil Wayne’s breakout album, Tha Carter II, and one of the best ever.
Hit me
Right in the sternum this time, T-Baby
Shit, you already know, you already know, you already know
Damn
Shit, this that hustler music
Young Weezy got that motherfuckin' hustler music
So ride to it, y'all, vibe to it, y'all, damn

Goddamn, Mix done hit a nigga in his head with this one
I'ma paint the city red with this one
I'm ahead with this one
See, you fucking with the boy who tote toys way before Christmas
No assistance just that persistence with that commitment if
I don't get it, somebody gon' die tonight
I know my vibe is tight and I deserve the throne
And if the kid ain't right, then let me die in this song
See, I be ridin', just ridin' alone
With my daddy on my mind like, "You gotta be kidding"
How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear, but no emotions from a king
Shall be, so I be who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the motherfuckin'
So I be who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the motherfuckin'

Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do for me and you, and we eatin'
So, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm takin' these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord

Money is the motivation, facing the avenue
Back touching the wall, got the weed, got the gun
Gotta run when I hear the bird call (Brr), damn (Brr)
Hop in that thing and murk off, swerve off
You know me, they call me Birdman Junior (Ah-ah)
Anybody murderer if Birdman sponsor it (For sure, nigga, get you, you heard?)
Phantom of the Opera, all black, guap tint, locked in
I can let them shots out, you can't get no shots in
Bulletproof, leave a nigga with a bullet-roof
Shoot ya in your mouth, Leroy, they call him bullet-tooth
I'm like, "What it do? What it do?"
There's a full court pressure, I'm just goin' for the two
If I'm open for the three, I'ma take it in a second
Even if there's one second, I'ma make it, it's nothin'
I don't take it for granted, I don't take it for nothin'
I take it for what it's worth to the dirt, motherfucker, yeah

Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do for me and you, and we eatin'
So, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm takin' these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord

I ain't never killed nobody, I promise
And I promise if you try me, he gon' have to rewind this track
And make me go back, that thing'll go rrat
That boy'll lay flat, so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got nina in my palm and I'm masturbating
Black Peter Pan, fly 'til I die, what you sayin'?
Bathing Ape, Yves Saint, Evisu what I stay in
Got me feeling like Scarface, light the Cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four-seater
You know I be out here right in a four-seater
Top floor of the Four Seasons
Four of them whores
And they all know how to cook it up
And look I got some
And only one know how to bag, bitch, bundle up
See, it's a cold world, so homie, bundle up
We ain't on this grind for nothin', now get your hustle up

Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do for me and you, and we eatin'
So, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm takin' these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord
Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do for me and you, and we eatin'
So, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?

Fuck wrong with these sissy niggas?
I'm smoking that Bill Bixby nigga
I'm spendin' money, spendin' money
Ben Franklin dizzy, nigga!
Your bitch on my dick, I told her I was busy
She say "Wayne on me, Wayne on me" 'cause yo' ass be drizzlin'
That pussy came gift-wrapped: bow and a ribbon
And if she bounce that ass, then I'm dribblin'
That pussy so wet, it turned into a Gremlin
There's only one me, ain't no equivalent
She give me brain, brain like trivia
I got a black bitch and a red bitch
I call them hoes Aunt Vivian
Chopper knock your face off
Black shades, Ray Charles
I be killing them hoes
I got your ho up in my graveyard
I ain't working with a full deck
But I pull out that Ace card
She grab that dick with 2 hands
Like she about to pray for it
Clips hanging, no curfew
Fuck you and who birthed you
I'm shining like church shoes
Birdman Jr.: y'all birdfood
I'm bout it.. I said I'm about to cum
She opened her mouth: water fountain
When I'm on the scene, I'm on that lean
Bitch, I'm drowsy
Man, I'm so high I don't know what I'm laughing about
I got bars, nigga and it's happy hour!

Ridin' 'round with them choppas, not them ninas
Ridin' with a bitch named Molly and she on Molly - ha!
Bitch, I put my foot in your ass: karate
Man, these niggas can't see me like a diary

Smoke that weed, let's get irie
Nina shut up, that bitch got a silence
Top of the gun there is a scope
I close one eye, I look like a pirate, fuck it!
TRUKFIT my bitch up, Tunechi leave big nuts
I'm getting my dick sucked
I blow weed like it's dust!
Spacehead: love pussy, hate feds
Just bought my girl a Ferrari Spider
Told her drive it like it got 8 legs
I'm a made nigga: Makaveli
That Mack-11: necessary
I'm a hard head: I pop the cherry
No pussy, no rats, no Tom and Jerry
They say your friends are your enemies?
Well, my friends are imaginary
I'm the motherfuckin' resolution like the 1st of January
My ride cold and my bitch hot
I'm tired as hell but my dick not
I don't gas no bitch, no pit-stop
Smoke Barney and Baby Bop!
Y'all niggas act like lady cops
My niggas smoke like coffee shops
That's syrup gang, wafflehouse
Gunfight, I'll knock you out
My bitch titties is poppin' out
We poppin' up and we get it poppin'
Mask on, gloves on
Like Mickey Mouse, clips stickin' out
Like Nicki's ass
Smoking on that sticky bag
Weezy F: I'm big and bad
Small feet, but I kick your ass
I'm the trigger man, and that shooting star
Eat that pussy like caviar
She treat that dick just like a straw
How you like them apples, Microsoft?
Now wipe it off..
I do Liv on Sundays: church!
Step off in that motherfucker fresher than some Certs
Uuh! Who the fuck is Stevie J?
I got the ball, playing keepaway
Kidnap your ass, kill your ass
Then hide your ass like an Easter Egg!
It's Hollygrove to my deathbed
Just make sure my pillow's fluffed
Hit a nigga with a million shots
What you call that? A million bucks
Good weed, we pass around
Money talks: mine got a nasty mouth
It's Young Money, Cash Money
'Til the motherfuckin day I'm Cashin Out!
Tunechi!

Riding 'round with them choppas, not them ninas
Your bitch wanna come over here where the grass is greener
And if you passing that weed, I'm the wide receiver
@LilTunechi, follow the leader Bitch!

You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He say he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue

I, I see you with your palms in your pants (haha!)
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger (yeah) I'm a critical thinker (yeah)
I'm a hell of a smoker (yeah) and a bit of a drinker (hey!)

I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

Uhh, down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble, better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Uh, smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared

Yeah I know your name (hey!) yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah (listen mayne)
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a rollercoaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

And I, see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker
I know your name...
As it is, shawty

Tell me something I don't know
I'm flexing on 'em like torsos
These niggas slipping like bar soap
These niggas listening, use Morse code
Boy, nigga sipping like parched throat
Ahe-he-hem, excuse me?
These niggas talking that beef shit
We'll check into it like the room's cheap
And all we sell is the greatest feeling on Earth
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got nothing left to prove, unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful corpse, yes, Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks
I sent five bricks with four chicks
Riding with these guns, that's carpooling
Bought extra clips when I dove in
Miss Snow White, we snowed in
Nigga, miss me with that ho shit
Kill all rats, I toast to that
And watch everybody I toast wit
Kill everybody you close with
Just don’t stick your nose in my bullshit
Cause I close it like a clothespin
The people that I rolls with
Will leave holes in what you drove in
If anyone in that car live
You tell that nigga I owe him, yeah
I got my mind right, my money right
My head on my shoulder
And my eyesight a little blurry, but
It's staying on my quota
And we find out Mom's address
And your head get mailed over
Nigga, you make that bed, you lay in that bed
Or get that bitch made over
Tunechi

You so crazy
Tunechi, you so crazy
Bitch, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say "Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, you so crazy"
Bitch

Tell me something I don’t know
I’ll tell you something I do know
Like money, drugs, bitches, guns
Niggas call me "Mucho"
Got witches all in my broom closet
Got little killers in JuCo
We’ll find out your business hours
And pop up like new toast
Like, danger taste like glucose
My shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes: kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
AK to your face; knock half off, like coupons
Too cool for school, but I sold cool points to schoolboys
Tell the cops, We don’t name drop, that's like droppin newborns
Nigga you crazy

You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes made me

Nigga tell me somethin I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go?
And show me somethin I haven’t seen
And give me what helped Martin sleep
On the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been
But not to where I never be in
I ain’t never scared, but I’m scared of me
Me vs. Me, I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputy, big letter B
Need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything
From amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than nectarine and Grenadine, ha!

You so crazy
Tunechi - you so crazy. Bitch
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
You so cray, bitch

Tell me somethin I don’t know
Like what happened to hard coke?
You can call me Eddie cause I stay ready
My family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears
I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad, with corn rows
With boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancin in the finest mansion
With the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine, pills, and weed, liquor and dick
She gotta micro manage
I'm just eatin rappers
They go nice in salads
With some diced up carrots
I just like a challenge
Psychopathic, so psychopathic
Nigga give me credit, or my balance
Lil Tunechi

Stand up niggas
(And I bump my head when I stand up)

You n*s gon' learn today
D4
YMCMB, n*

Ugh, hammer on the dresser, work on the stove
I'm sitting on the counter blowing purp out my nose
Red bone naked, in the bed flexin'
I say, bitch, I ain't impressed you must've got the wrong impression, ugh
I ain't with the BS, I'm flyer than PF
Man, we living in hell like a deep breath
Real niggas with real money, real bitches with fake asses
If she don't wanna fuck, I get on my skateboard and I skate past her
Money on the table, guns on the table
Bitch, I'm on that syrup, tell that ho leggo my Eggo
And my girlfriend is a chopper, I finger-fuck that ho
Hello I am Tunechi: you had me at "hello," ugh
Drop-top Maybach, clean like Ajax
Man, I don't fuck with none of you niggas, like rednecks
We got that work so come and get if we dont know you, you pay tax
I put a hole in your apple—what that is? Apple Jacks, ugh
Pussy nigga, I'll murder you, then dance at your funeral
Blood, I'll have a nigga drinking his own blood: communion
Wake up like Bone Thugs, I'll call your bluff pick the phone up
Her titties fake, but they look real: cubic zirconias
Run up in your house, spare the kids and kill the grown-ups
Your bitch call me when she hot: Krispy Kreme doughnuts
Shoutout to my new hoes, shoutout to my old hoes
I still wear that ass out like a wardrobe

Bitch, what they gonna say?
Still eating rappers on my fucking lunch break
Bad yellow bitch with a tongue like a snake
I let her suck my dick and then I fuck her to some Drake
And then I let that kush burn, let that kush burn
Yeah I let that kush burn, smoking gasoline, bitch
The booth on fire, I'm in here getting higher
Young Money, bitch, we at the top like barbed wire, ugh

Money on my mind I ain't thinking 'bout no bitch
I'm talking bout that scratch like my muhfuckin throat itch, ugh
Stop stuntin'—if you ballin', buy your bitch somethin'
Stayed on the same team like Tim Duncan
Shit get real—if you're scared, go to Catholic school
And if we want it, straight jack it, like a padded room
Shoot your ass a hundred times and stand over you
Lil' Tunechi so fly I got arachnophobia
Burn bitch, AK in my firm grip
Leap if you feeling like Kermit, sermons
Preach reach and I smoke your ass like Cheech
I be faded like bleach; double-barrel: Siamese
I like my Swisher obese; fuck that bitch, like police
Fuck these haters with no grease; you get chin-checked: goatee
Money talks, bitch, and mine talks like Robin Leach
That lean got me slow as Lisa Turtle—ask Screech, ugh
Bank card heavy, my wallet like a barbell
My girl got a fat cat: I call that shit "Garfield"
We'll bring the O.K. Corral to your doorbell
We pull triggers not coattails, I make lump sums: oatmeal
I'm stuntin', getting new money
Trukfit money, Mountain Dew money, tell 'em
I get better like fine wine, I'm fire like cayenne
In the words of my nigga BP, "I'll hit a bitch with a car bomb—boom!"

Lil' bitch
Niggas gonna talk they ain't talking bout shit
Niggas gonna bark I go Mike Vick
Fuckin' fuck niggas on that fuck shit
Suck a nigga dick for some Trukfit
And let that kush burn, let that kush burn
Yeah I let that kush burn, smoking gasoline, bitch
The booth on fire, I'm in here getting higher
Holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer—Tune!

Hahaha
Dedication 4
Meek, Sean—fuck with me!

75 ContributorsTrippy Lyrics“Trippy” serves as one of the slower tracks from I Am Not A Human Being II. The Crazy Mike produced track features a verse from Juicy J. On “Trippy”, the verses are centered around drug use and being high.
We trippy mayne (Mayne, mayne, mayne, mayne, mayne)

Uh, blue skies, blue skies, I see you with my red eyes
Bust your fucking grape, nigga, turn your shit to red wine
Don't fuck up my high, nigga, I'm too gone, bye nigga
She get dick, weed, and ignored: that's a D.W.I., nigga
My skin crawlin', my walls talkin', the pictures in here lookin' at me
The ground movin', I'm seein' shit, I'm blowin' like I'm stuck in traffic
I'm smoking on that strong, got me coughin' like I'm getting buried
I've been fuckin' Mary Jane, I knew her when she was just Virgin Mary
I'm stoned, Mick Jagger, I can run around Saturn
Eyes rolling back, and keep blinking like hazards
I said, "King me", king me with my mushroom crown on
I graduated to better drugs, my cap and gown on
Don't knock me off my high horse, what I do is my choice
I'm high as the scoreboard, bitch, look up at my points
I'm trippin' out, cotton mouth, I got high and fell asleep loaded
I woke up and got high again, okay, I'm reloaded, uh

Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit

We trippin', uh
Shoutout to my weed man, shoutout to my lean man
Pussy ass nigga wanna spark something, I'm a gasoline can
I'm high nigga, don't blow it, I trust it far as I could throw it
I don't know if I'm coming or going, T, make my blunt a Samoan
And I see lights flashin', life passin', take a bitch home, fuck like rabbits
Styrofoam cups and wine glasses, shot glasses, hot flashes
My tongue numb, I can't talk, no balance, my spine hurts
My mind surf, my eye jerks, I try different drugs, I'm diverse
Goodbye Earth, farewell, high as Heaven, eyes low as Hell
Keep scratching, keep biting my nails
Keep lighting a L, I'm a kite in the air
I like weed brownies and cookies, I'm straight but seeing crooked
I got my trippy kit, I hope I trip and fall in some pussy
Tunechi

Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit...

Musty herb in a Ziploc, twistin' up top notch
Weed that I smoke, straight off a boat
Six foot bong, tryna see what I toke
This that Cali Kush, I motivate not gloat
All I need is Mary, let the models do the coke
Tryna get some Becky in the backseat of the Ghost
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag
Wake up every morning and I take a drag
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then I laugh
In your baby mama ear, and I'm gonna smash
They call me the trippy king, don't try me nigga
Juicy J with the Taylors, Chinese eyes, nigga

Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit

Ayy, the blues is now kickin', and dinner is three Michelin
I don't eat red meat, but still got beef sizzlin'
Know that I need discipline
I keep singin' for all these hoes, they keep listenin'
Niggas love to bro up with the boy and dap fists-es
But we are not equivalent, dawg
I been an only child, don't need siblings
And I'm past them like the times that he's livin' in, okay
Man, if you saw what I flew here, you'd be like, "He's sickenin'"
If you not runnin' some top, we not gon' keep kickin' it
Classics, I keep scribblin', lights in the Universal building just keep flickerin'
Money just keep comin' in, you would think I'm Irish the way that it stays doublin'
I could feed a country with the tax that I pay governments
Whatеver they're doin' with my cash is vеry troublin'
Okay, February came around, I used to get paid shovelin'
Sold clothes, walked dogs, trust me, I stay hustlin'
When it came to school, there's no way that I'm A-plus-in' it
So I just dropped out of it, trust me, I'm not proud of it
Niggas get too comfy in they spot, they get knocked out of it
Niggas get a gun just so they can make props out of it
Shawty make a scene in the house, she get locked out of it
Yeah, you not 'bout to be chillin' in this bitch with kicked feet up
I'ma make you bounce out this ho like Big Freedia
Pete O. used to throw a purple tint on a two-liter
First private plane I ever rode was a eight-seater
Before that, I got the bedroom hot with a space heater
On top of that, I didn't have shit to my name either, that's real
But now I'm givin' house tours 'til it's back to world tours
Play that "Mask Off" when they find the real cure
I might not be good for her, but I'm real to her
Got no time for her, but give Richard Mille to her
That's the only way I know how to express love
My dawgs love sticks and drums like they Questlove
All them jokes about Aubrey, they got me messed up, for real
I come with a lot of complications inside me
It's always people misleadin' me that are tryna guide me
Everyone wants to try me, but no one wants to buy me
Everyone wants to meet me, but no one wants to keep me
Everyone talkin' lemons when everything is peachy
Everyone got they hands out, and it ain't to reach me

Mhm, yeah, mhm
Everyone got they glass out, let's drink to Weezy
Every nigga that stare me down just came to see me
Choppin' up a lil' cash cow, that's steak I'm eatin'
Check deposits, high-risers with extra closets
The sex platonic, I talk intelligent, text Ebonics
The electronic guitars whinin', that's just Nirvana
Tommy gun on the counter, I call it Mr. Thomas
That'll keep niggas honest
I'm dozin' off in the driver seat 'cause the seat give massages
Decimal point money, these numbers too steep for commas
I'm eye to eye with niggas, I can't help but to see beyond 'em
Got a two-seater problem
Niggas thinkin' they cold, I knock the flu-season out 'em
Bitches forget they hoes, and that's when Tunechi remind 'em
I used to fuck Gucci models, I'm fuckin' Gucci designers
I keep it too G regardless, I'm gettin' too deep for divers
Let me resurface, I'm flexin' on purpose
She especially curvy, bet she be servin' every purpose, perfect
I'm better than perfect, I'm sick, I need to see a medical person
Eatin' all of these rappers with these edible verses
All I gotta be is all that I can possibly
She really, really into me, then suck it all up out of me
I'm proud of me, I don't know how to be sorry, apologies
You fuckin' with my math, you better know some trigonometry
'Cause I'ma be bustin', leave your lima bean at your mama feet
I flip the economy like Dominique Dawes
They say I'm trippin', I guess they wishin' I finally fall
I don't need war, I need a bitch that know I'ma need yours
I'ma need more, niggas is shifty like Honda Accords
Fire alarm, ain't got no ceilings, we climbin' the walls
Higher than yours, I fuck your bitch and she die in my arms
Lion has roared, No Ceilings 3 with my mind on the fourth
Holla at your boy

Un-fucking-believable! Lil Wayne's the president
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch; call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him—bury him?
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight, baby, so I don't let the Devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar
Yeah, bitch, I'm heavy metallin'

Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estrogen
And we hold court and take your life for a settlement
Yes, I am the best—and no, I ain't positive, I'm definite

Tied to the fuckin' Birdman like a lug

To you I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim
Cash Money million-heir to the throne
Goin' at their heads, like hair in a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the storm
Know I'll make it through it like hair in a comb
Young Money over bitches, my niggas trust my senses
And I will take a dasher as the Lord is my witness
And you all have witnessed, but I am not finished
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen

Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm still a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire, bitch

I'm rappin' when you sleep

Mel Gibson flow, Lethal Weapon, book 'em, Danny
I'm a monster, I tell you, Monster Wayne

Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain
Fuck with me, I will peel like the house's paint—let's go!
Niggas don't wanna see me ‘cause I'm better in bold
The only time I will depend is when I'm 70 years old
That's when I can't hold my shit within, so I shit on myself
‘Cause I'm so sick and tired of shittin' on everybody else
I try to tell you like I'm sayin' somethin'
I'm from the Dirty like the bottom of my pants cuff
And now nothin' gonna stop me, so just envy it
Hey, I'll accept a friendly quit, ha ha

Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, bitch I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
Fuck you , you're not me

You sweet as pie, a muffin or cake
Dick in her mouth, I'm fuckin' her face
Live for the night, sleep in the day
Get high as fuck, sleep it away
I am a dog, you sheep in the gate
Pussy, mmm, how sweet is the taste
Gun to your head, what you keep in the safe?
Weezy, bitch, I'm deeper than space
Floating away like a leaf on the lake
I'm gone, like delete and erase
Talk that shit, I walk that shit
Pills, weed, all that shit
If the bitch is bad, I'ma call that bitch
Get pussy, ass, all that shit
Mmm, what they talking about?
I go hard, they soft as a couch
I'm running 'em in and walking 'em out
Cars so cold I parked in the house
Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it
Money tall, Lisa Leslie
YMCMB connection
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Woman up in my sheets is sexy
If she ain't fucking, she can exit
Gun tucked in the waist, I'll bust in ya face

You're lucky I don't kill your ass
But you can still get pistol whipped
Sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch, don't even fix your lip
40 cal' with the extended clip
Ain't gon' be no incident
Skinny jeans, red Vans
Skully on, money long
Her mouth is like my house
So I guess you can say I'm coming home
You're wyling out then we're riding out
Now your hiding out, honeycomb
I'm laughing to the bank
Like I just broke my fucking funny bone
What's really good five?
I'm over here smoking that really good fire
Eyes so low I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook fine
I be with niggas that took lives
And niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape the housewives
I'm gon' get so wasted
They gon' have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit
These rappers are just my hostages
Let's cut to the chase, my bitch no habla ingles
But I ain't got nothing to say, but up, up and away

Up, up and away, up, up and away
Man, I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up, up and away, up, up and away
Man, I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

Fuck that shit, I'm Superbad

Ha, President Carter, vote for Lil Wayne
Sit your five dollar ass down 'fore I make change
I'm pumping your brakes, I'm jumping the gates
And I ain't got nothing to say, but up, up and away

Weezy, where you going?
You're going a little bit too far
(Up, up and away)

Up, up and away (Up, up and away)

Come here, I might need you
You're gonna have to tickle me or something
I need to smoke a cigarette

Yeah...  Sick shit
I been walkin' on this water, bone dry, hard times
R.I.P. baby, my phone died, but don't cry
Heaven's gates was closed, I went to Hell, there was a long line
Two hoes in the bed, it's hard to wake up on the wrong side

Few bumps in the road, a little bump and grind I don't mind
Please know, for your fuckin' piggy bank you could get hog tied
Two Ninas on me, you fuck with me, them girls goin' wild
Guilty conscience pimpin', make my ho sit through the whole trial
I been walkin' on this fuckin' water for a long time
Molly water got me transformin' like I'm Voltron
Smokin' so much weed, I might just fuck around and hug a tree
A tree without a bird 'cause I deserve every fuckin' leaf

1, 2, 3; triple-OG
At the T-O-P smokin' P-O-T
From a D-O-G to the G-O-D
Got OCD and not your CD
Hit her with the D-O-P-E D
That's Dope Dick Tunechi, DDT
You could D-I-E for a F-E-E
I'll D-I-E for my S-E-T
I told my son that "Whatever the sun touch is yours, little nigga"
I told my daughter, "Don't give up your love to a poor little nigga"
I told my bitch if she cheat then she making a poor decision
I told that bitch if she leave then she leavin' the solar system
But hoes don't listen
But I'm on the road to riches, and she can't ignore the engine
I bought myself a medallion that cost an Azure, my nigga
I don't know, guess I was bored, my nigga
Tell foreign hoes "I'm El Señor", my nigga
To the Moon like Warren, nigga
He ain't the plug unless he foreign, nigga
It ain't a car unless it's foreign, nigga
And a R plus another R, my nigga
But I used to want a Ford Explorer, nigga
Had to move the trap house to Florida, nigga
Had to move The Carter by the water, nigga
But I'm still too scared to get in the water, nigga
'Bout to throw another pool party, nigga
I told a op that wherever this gun point is holes, lil nigga
Stayin' on my feet, no tappin' on my toes, like Moses, nigga
I told the cops that my car is too fast to pull over, nigga
Cool as fuck, keepin' my cool before my composure, nigga
That's poker, nigga
Playin' the cards I was dealt, and that shit almost broke a nigga
But I could be broker, nigga
But I’m watching Oprah, nigga
In my white house layin' on my sofa, keepin' it soulful, nigga
I'm a young mogul, nigga
I'm a young Hova, nigga
My office is oval, nigga

I step out that bitch like, "What's happenin'?"
Me and that little bitch I was nappin' in
Time to run with no rubber, I'm gamblin'
Just call me the rapper, I'm Chancin' it
Got a sassy bitch, told her "I'm daddy, bitch"
Do it look like I'm playin'? Kaepernick
Niggas don't know a star from an asterisk
This that new coffin, new casket shit
My killers killin' on purpose by accident
And you passed that shit like a laxative
Ain't where or why you trap, it's who you trappin' with
For me it's about who I travel with
Never about the bitch that I be snappin' on
It's the one that the picture just snapped me with
That's 'cause I'm the shit, and all of my shit be maggot less
E

Yeah, uh-huh, said, yeah
This that Baby E and Wayne shit
We just landed in a spaceship
So now ain't nobody safe, bitch
It's Dedication number 6, bitch
Got a hundred in the safe, bitch
I been fuckin' on a gay bitch
Fuck your set and what you claim, bitch
It's Young Mula to the grave, bitch
I'm still finessin', and I'm still progressin'
This is tick, tick-tick, I'ma blow up any second, yeah
We the bestest, ain't no fuckin' question
It's six, six-six, 'til it's Dedication 7
Fully loaded, money is the motive
All my bros is Gs, take a guess at what the code is
Pour a four in, fuck it pour some more in
Rest In Peace Lil Peep, we already miss you homie

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said "I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Baby, you understand me now
If, sometimes, you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ugh, what’s understood ain’t got to be explained
But you don't understand me, so let me explain
Heh, stood in the heat, the flame
The snow, "Please, slow down, hurricane"
The wind blow, my dreads swang
"He had hair like wool, like Wayne"
Huh, dropping ashes in the Bible
I shake 'em out, and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary, no tale-fairy
All real, very extraordinary
Perry Mason facin' the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge; no gown, no gavel
A hound, a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, or whenever, and the F for...
"Fucking fantastic"—fuck if you agree
I'm bright, but I don't give a fuck if you see me

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ugh, what's understood ain't got to be explained
So for those who understand, meet Dwayne
For eight and a half months I gave Miss Cita pain
Now it's Young Money, baby—keep the change
My mama say, "Fuck 'em!" And we the same
So hello, motherfucker, you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday?
You know; church fit, then out-fit
Bright pink and green chest look house-lit
Bright pinky rings, but that ain't about this
What you 'bout, bitch?
Excuse my French emotion and my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you askin'? If I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand
'Cause you thought Little Wayne was Weezy, but Weezy is Wayne

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood


I'm watchin' TV the other day, right? Got this white guy on there talking 'bout Black guys. Talking about how young Black guys are targeted. Targeted by who? America.
You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up. One in every nine Black Americans are locked up. And see, what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail, a young motherfucker to jail, would be less to send his or her young ass to college.
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers. You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that. Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine, the police are... only... I don't want to say only right, but, shit... only logic by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found—you know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucker to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; Level 3, Level 4 drugs, shit like that.
Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood, and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood, huh? Yeah.
You know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared. I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the Level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out.
And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what? (coughing) Don't stop the track. That's the good weed.
You know what? I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him? Meaning, he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then, you move in a sex offender. Hahaha. Then give me a paper. Haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it.
Another thing. Let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh... Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you.
Mhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, "'spec before check," anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha.
Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhm, hold on, um...
Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you: You don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!
But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. But I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha.

You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King... with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him
Fuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!

But oh, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Oohh, ooh
So special, you're so special

Uh, boy shorts, wife beater
Now let me see it, I'm a sightseer
She was sleeping on me, but she's a light sleeper
I make her cum first, then I follow the leader
I talk shit, I hope it matters
We climax, without the ladder
Can't desert the future, no Nevada
Her body is a weapon, ratatat her
I spent the night in heaven, I slept with an angel
And when we finish, I swear that pussy said thank you
I said, "You're very welcome", I'm so well mannered
And I go down south, Louisiana

Baby, won't you spend the night?
Darling, I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special, so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'ma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special, so special, so special)

Then we take a shower together, and wash each others back
And if she kick it off, I'ma run it back
And then she say my name, like I forgot it
She crazy about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt
Love be the pilot, but it's kamikaze
Yeah, body language, girl, let's talk about it
Freedom of speech, Weezy a beast
Open her up like a book, read it and weep

Baby, won't you spend the night?, uh
Darling, I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special, so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'ma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special, so special, so special)
So special

Yeah, thinking 'bout you girl, got my mind on E
You know them other niggas ain't me
Girl, I got that 12 play for ya, that 12 play for ya
Just sit on my grill, that's that tailgate for ya
I, put it together, common denominator
I tear it up like loose leaf paper
I got drinks on chill, my bedroom huge
I knock her lights out, I blow her fuse
See, we don't even fuck no more, we make love
And now she's on the tip of my tongue, my taste buds
'Cause she my honey bee, yeah, buzz buzz
And now I'm itching and scratching, that's that love bug

Baby, won't you spend the night?
Darling, I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special, so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'ma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special, so special, so special)
(Girl I got that 12 play for ya)
(So special girl, so special to me)

Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky (Yeah)
You must be famous
This is how you live your life, different city every night (Yeah)
You must be famous, famous

I'ma be on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, "Oh my God"
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, "Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me"
'Cause superstars don't sparkle, superstars beam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV, mama

Welcome to your name in lights (Woo!)
All the lighters in the sky (I must be famous)
You must be famous (Yeah, oh my God I must be famous)
This is how you live your life (Yeah)
Different city every night (I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
Message to my lawyer: "Don't let me make these bitches famous"
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, "Am I dreamin'?"
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass
And I heard, "Can you look this way? Can you look this way?"
Flash! I must be famous

Welcome to your name in lights (Yeah!)
All the lighters in the sky (You must be famous)
You must be famous (I'ma be on the TV, mama!)
This is how you live your life (Yeah, yeah)
Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

You probably thought that my career, be short and sweet
You wish that I was in your shoes, I'd take them off 'cause life's a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we shine deep
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, "Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me"
'Cause superstars don't twinkle, superstars gleam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV, mama

Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous (Oh my God, I must be famous)
This is how you live your life
Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

I'ma be on the TV, mama
Kiss my motherfuckin' ass

(We got London on da Track)

All I know is paper, I don't know these hoes
I like mouth in my lap and pussy on my nose
And I'm bringin' home the bacon, it's fryin' on the stove
You hoes can't drive me crazy, keep your eyes on the road
Got the money on my mind, and bodies on my nine
And I swear every day, I'm on my Ariana grind-de
I got that yay, I got that la-di-da-di-da
And a kamikaze squad, and you chicken parmesan
Lord, I'm a free man like I come from Amistad
No, I come from Hollygrove, turnin' Os to octagons
I get money while I'm 'sleep, I dream that I'm in Heaven
I dream I saw Lil Beezy and smoked a 'gar with Wessy
All my niggas, rest in peace, and my enemy, rest pleasant
So when my niggas creep, they catch him when he least expect 'em
Mama told me "If you run these streets, run these streets correctly"
Well, feet don't fail me now; I never knew my feet to test me
Lord knows I wear new clothes to the mall
Two hoes on my arm
Fur boots when it's warm
Church shoes to play ball
I'm spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog
Urkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me
All I love is paper, I don't love these hoes
Boy, that vest won't save you, neither will heroes
Lord, they better hope you save him, better catch the holy ghost
Holy moly, hockey mask like Halloween like OVO
Lord, all I know is strippers, all they know is poles
All they sell is pussy 'cause they been sold they soul
Boy, you go zero to sixty, I go one-and-two-zeros
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord, all I know is paper, big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is, that bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience 'til I heard "All aboard"
They mad 'cause I be skatin' at home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
Goddamn, a pint of lean almost 5K
I be spendin' 25K every 5 days
I sent my girl on a spa day
'Cause Hood just came with them chickens
I don't want you in the house, bae
Plus we need the kitchen
Lord, trap house in abundance
We got trap houses in London, y'all don't hear me

(We got London on da Track)

Hol' up, had to switch the flow up
Had to pour up, roll some more up
Watch me go up, my doors go up
When I show up, why you show up?
Pick my bro up, pick a O up
Hit the store up, get a soda
Get us four cups, split a four up
Then we slow up, yeah, you know us
Then we toast cups and we post up
Don't approach us, we got toasters
That's my slime, like we ghostbust
And we both bust, give no fucks
Take no stuff and take your stuff
Then ho hunt for some chocha
I know a ho who'll rock the boat
But I row her, I'm Noah, Lord
I remember when I was no one, Lord
When I couldn't find jack in no one's cards
Ms. Cita, I remember goin' in your gun drawer
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimeters
Oh Lord, I remember dyin' on her room floor
And wakin' up in some police's arms, he died recent
So I hope Heaven made more room for him, and I hope he see me
'Cause if he didn't save that lil boy, there'd be no Weezy
Oh Lord

Sorry for the wait, man
Album coming August 29th, though
Tez made me do this song

Ain't nobody fuckin' with me
First-degree murder, you can get your degree, motherfucker
And you ain't gotta wonder about me, Wonder Woman
Tune gon' ball, money tall, Paul Bunyan
Real nigga shit, pussy niggas gon' hate
Pound of the kush, call that bitch "pound cake"
I hit it from the back and make that bitch about-face
And then I gotta split, sorry, baby, sour grapes
She whine, "Baby, don't leave"
I duck that bullshit, bob and weave
Everybody trippin', but I ain't never trippin'
Leave your ass flatter than my new television
I'm talkin' 'bout money and the power, power and the money
This shit is magic: Stan Van Gundy
I'ma run this shit 'til I'm the last man runnin'
Mack, light that shit, then pass that to me
Young Money, motherfucker, yeah, we that shit
Yeah, Weezy go hard like Cialis
Don't love that bitch, I fucked that ho
She pop X; I smoke O's—tic-tac-toe
And I stink, 'cause I got a lot of shit on my mind
They say numbers don't lie—is that a 6 or a 9?
I stand in front of the clock, 'cause I'm ahead of the time
Knock your pussy ass off and send your head to your mom
I ain't playin' with niggas, no, sir, not me
And they can't blindfold what my third eye see
Yeah, I was locked up, but like a bird, I'm free
And the coupe transform, no Tyrese
Hello, goodbye, where are you, Wayne?
I'm somewhere in between joy and pain
And I reach for the stars, got stuck in the clouds
Got high as a bitch and left my love on the ground
Now, ain't that 'bout a bitch? It ain't never 'bout a bitch
I'll take your bitch and make her everybody bitch
Backed up by a bunch of G-ass niggas
And I just bought your girlfriend some kneepads, nigga
Ha, Eagle Street, where the real niggas hung
I'ma rep that shit 'til kingdom come
Yeah, $hort bring the drank, I bring the blunts
Fuckin' with me, it's blood, brains or guts, argh!
Fuck y'all, for real, though
Sleep with the hammer under the pillow
Get into the room, bend her over like her elbows
Soon as I'm done, peel off like velcro
Gone, baby, I'm stoned
Smokin' on the strong, got a huge-ass bong
Swag off the hook, you can't use that phone
Stopped at the light and put my roof back on
Haha, one time for the G's
The niggas got it locked, the niggas with the keys
The niggas on the block, the niggas on they P's and Q's
Put your bitch-ass on the evenin' news
Jumpin' in the game, better read the rules
High as a bitch, yeah, that's me on the moon
Fuck with me, die soon, not late
And I'm sorry for the motherfuckin' wait—Tunechi!

Ha...
Take it, FATBOI
No Ceilings
Ugh

Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
President, got 'em in the White House naked
Looked at the clock and it say, "Right now"
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panatela Dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money, baby, big shit, like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti, matte black—"Where they do that at?"
South Beach Miami, ho, I'm probably with Tammy To'
My life is a video and the women want they cameo
I just want them pantyhose, and I'm higher than Ger-an-imo
And I got them tools, tell them boys it could get mechanical
Now, pop that pussy like a four-four
I turn you 'round and bend you over like a low blow
It's Young Money, baby, we the fucking greatest
We done put them other niggas on a hiatus
Beat your bitch with the pump if she deny data
'Cause I'll serve anyone like a blind waiter
I make my girl cum first; then, I arrive later
I shake you pussies up, I'm a vibrator, haha!
G—Getting money like, "Hell yeah"
This shit so good, it don't even smell bad
And you can tell Dad that I'm a motherfucker
You niggas bet' not slip—Ice Road Truckers
Light-pole barrel, chopper stupid-long
New Orleans nigga, I get super-dome
Loyal to the game, the game been good to me
Still spitting fire, you niggas wood to me, ha!
We on, nigga; let—let them hoes know
Young Money lay 'em down like old folks
You coming with it? We coming for it
Plenty to go around—now, watch the money orbit
Real shit, people; now, just absorb it
I tried to pay attention, but y'all mad boring
And I got so much swag, I need an ad for it
And I don't like to brag, so my bitches brag for me
Oh, she a good girl? I got her transforming
She give me hot head, I call it "global warming"
If we gon' do it, dog, let's do it now
I—I—I am more animal than the zoo allow
Put me in the wild, I'll be there for a while
You niggas Little League, call 'em Curaçao
Energizer money: it keep going
I'm laid up, I'm free-throwing
Who rebounding? Who gives a shit?
Fuck that, I got 27 years of this
Hit or miss, I hit your missus
You are local news; I'm 60 Minutes
I—I hit the target, I hit the witness
I work out in my office—guess I'm fit for business
Too many visions, completed missions
Still icing out crosses—keep it Christian
We consistent, the streets commend it
Weezy F. Baby, the "F" is for "Forensics"
From start to finish, Usain Wayne
OK, you doing your thing? Well, things change
You plain-Jane, I'm diverse
I save the world second, and I get high first
I'm a mind freak, check my time sheet
Bitch, I bring the noise where the lions sleep
Your flow never wet, like Grandma pussy
I'm always good, like Grandma cookies
Yeah, call me the spleen or the spine fixer
It's going down like the Catalina Wine Mixer
She going down like the hands on my time-ticker
I'm always strapped—Vietnam, nigga
We are fine, nigga, like Amber Rose
We ball, nigga, like Jalen Rose
Better tell them hoes, I got a million flows
Label me the hardest nigga in civilian clothes
Young Money, baby, and the building grows
As we look up—where did the ceilings go?

Hahaha
No Ceilings

Ugh!
Twist made me do this
Paw-Paw in here with me, T in here with me
Ugh

Kush in the Swisher, money over bitches
Never kill a woman, unless she a witness
All about my business, survival of the fittest
She let me hide my weed in her titties
Bitch, I got the cash, in a rubberband
I got the Glock, already cocked, boom!
Fucking with a nigga, meet my motherfucking goons
Sorry 4 the Wait, Carter IV coming soon
Light it up, 'cause I'ma smoker
She tried to deepthroat, I fucked around and choked her
It's Young Money, motherfucker, game over
Shots leave your body, looking like you doing yoga
And Lord knows I'm a sinner, pain pills for dinner
Bitch, I'm getting money like I got a money printer
Got a chopper and a trimmer, shooting like Jimmer
You coming in that water, boy, you better be a swimmer
I ain't worrying 'bout y’all, sitting on my Hog
While Miss Anita Baker sing "You Bringing Me Joy"
I came straight outta jail and did my thing on these boys
And we all yelled, "Fuck you, bitch!" and kept going
I'm on, and that's right, baby
I ain't going out this bitch without a fight, baby
One request: please don't bite, baby
I got some bomb-ass pussy from a white lady
I ain't lying, I'ma shine like a nickel or a diamond
I smoke a lot of weed to keep them bitches off of my mind
Girl, stop talking that shit
Go on and suck a nigga dick for a new outfit, hahaha
And even if the sky come falling
Bitch, I'ma still be high
I got faith in my weedman
My lil niggas got yay' by the beanbag
Hit your ass from the side like a screen pass
And that red bandana is the team flag
Yeah, all up in your fucking face
Tez pushed the album back; Sorry 4 The Wait

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh-huh

Wear a helmet when you bang it, man, and guard your brain

Fly Wizzy, my opponent's done, I'm done talkin' (Shut up)
And I ain't just begun
I been runnin' my city like Diddy, you chump

Birdman, put them niggas in a trash can
Leave 'em outside of your door, I'm your trashman
I'm steady lighting up the hash, and, riding in my Jag
You will need a gas mask, man
You snakes, stop hiding in the grass
Sooner or later I'll cut it, now the blade's in your ass
You homo niggas getting AIDS in the ass
While the homie here tryna get paid in advance
I'm staying on my grizzy, I'm a bona fide hustler
Play me or play with me, then I'm gonna find your mother
Niggas wanna eat, 'cause they ain't ate nothin'
But niggas wanna leave when you say you out of mustard
So I'ma walk into the restaurant alone
Leaving out, leaving behind just residue and bones
In your residence with Rugers to your dome
Like, "Where the fuck you holding the coke?"
Holding your throat, choke

So, go

I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah, nah
And I'm laughing at them pussy niggas
And that pussy shit they doin'
I'm getting cake like I'm Jewish
My nigga Drake, he Jewish
I swear to god I ain't nervous, nah, hahah
Okay, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous
I say, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin', twerkin' and slurping my serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch, for certain
I see you turning up but your turn up ain't working
Just want some mouth and lip service
And I got all my niggas in that truck like an Excursion

Okay, I'm straight at you, no ricochet
That pussy boneless, that's Chick-fil-a
I fuck with real riders and they tickets paid
For them dead presidents, we will start digging graves
I swear my momma trust my work
So I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free
That's why it cost for you to get murked
And my pants sagging like fuck it - I'm still on my business
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions
Saw my enemy at the light, shot him up before it turned green
Mane my niggas got them birds, you ain't even got bird seeds
Your bitch ride me like a go kart, I play that pussy like Mozart
I Mozart these hoes' hearts then after that, they worthless

Man, I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
I said I swear to God I ain't nervous
I don't know, I swear to God I ain't nervous
And that pussy don't get purchased, ho
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain
I see you turning up but your turn up ain't working
I like 'em long haired and curvy
And if niggas think it's a game
I'll leave they brains on their jerseys

She say she love me, that's the molly talking
She about to blow me, like a signing bonus
She got a nigga but he ain't me, bitch
I'm an original gangster, he the remix
Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday suit is her pajamas
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him
I get Adam like Yolonda
Young Money Cash Money, Obama
It's fuck the world, no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence

But I swear to God he heard it, yeah
And I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah
I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
Bitch, I'm the God, I should be rapping in a turban
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
I see you turning up but your turn up ain't working
Baby, I just want some mouth and lip service
She gon' ride this dick like the Kentucky Derby

On that Pat-ron, I'm swerving, game tight like virgins
I got a bad bitch, she Persian, call her AK when she's squirting
You see the niggas I'm with, that boy Boo the shit
As long as I got a face, yo bitch got a place to sit
Yea, I'm wilding off them shroomies
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi
All my chicks be bougie
Wanna hold hands then watch movies
I be goddamned, make a nigga lose it
Ain't no talking, let's get to it
Real niggas winning, fake niggas losing
Bitch, I'll leave that pussy with bruises

Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
I swear to God I ain't nervous
No, you know I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin', twerkin' and slurping my serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
You fuck with Tunechi, you'll end up a missing person
She got Lil Tunechi on her booty, in cursive
I'm getting head behind the Maybach curtains

Money, power, respect; three the hard way
I put some real niggas on their feet, boy
So they'll kill anyone for me, boy
Yeah, YMCMB, boy
Young Tunechi, fresh to death, Rest In Peace, boy

My gat bang, your hat hang, I ride off with Mack Maine
I drink Patron straight, you niggas keep that champagne
My Pa is the Birdman, I'm rich as a white man
I come to your show and kill you and your hype man
We rollin', let's roll out, my bitches don't hold out
They got Marley G, I gotta bond my lil bro out
Let my dreads grow out, my bitch got a blow out
Mi casa, su casa; my house is a ho house
Only fuck with real niggas, Polo, fuck that Hilfiger
Yeah, I'm on a pill, nigga, feed you to my lil niggas
Shout out to my big homies, Fee-Fee and T-Streets
Scope on that AK, make me take a sneak peek
T, roll another one, razor blade under tongue
You ain't never seen this watch, nigga, this a one of one
You niggas is Honey Bun, your girlfriend a ton of fun
Chopper with a drum, motherfucker, give the drummer some
Blunt fat like my blunt a thumb, suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Pop that pussy for me, then wild out and give my niggas some
I'ma do my thing, I put that on Nicki Minaj
I need a bad redbone to come give my dick a massage
I'm talkin' big money, I'm talkin' heavyweight
I cut down on the syrup, now I'm in better shape
I'm from New Orleans, nigga, where you ain't never safe
You fuck with me, I drop you off in front of Heaven gates
Okay, jump off a buildin', jump out a window
Smoke like a junkie and fuck like a nympho
Drink like a goldfish, that's right, you know this
Hold up; Click-clack! Okay, I'm reloaded
Fuck with Lil Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Wild as Ryu, I hit you with that "Hadouken"
My money too long, nigga, my weed too strong, nigga
Fuck everybody, I'm in my own zone, nigga

Uh, and every time you see me I'm wet
And I'm rollin', Tunechi, Rest In Peace, fresh to death
And I'm rollin', 'bout to fuck a bitch I just met
'Cause she rollin', nigga, we rollin', nigga, I'm rollin'
Gotta keep a towel, I'ma sweat
'Cause I'm rollin', goin' at a bitch nigga neck
'Cause I'm rollin', damn, ma, I ain't come yet

I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
I used to walk a thin line, now I'm walking chin high
I used to fuck and get tired, now I fuck her ten times
She used to make me dick rise, now she make me ribeyes
She used to make me six-nine, now she make her friend try
She used to make me love her, now she make me realize
It's money over bitches 'till the day I dizz-ie
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago, if he dies, he dies

Find out where he reside and find out where he hide
Run up in that bitch like, "Hey," pop-pop-pop, peace sign
Percocet, promethazine, you can call me P-Rod
Taking shots at my team, you must be getting senile
You goin' at my slime then you're going at me, slime
Your blood all over the scene, it look like red cheap wine
I'm smoking on a key lime, you look like tea time
Look like honey to my beehive, I close your sweet eyes
Shoot ya in ya head, give ya ass three eyes
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5
I remember you, I was never into you
I tell my shooters, shoot you and whoever resemble you
And every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you
They in it too, and bitches too, they mention you, they dentures loose
Run up in a nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
Safe code now nigga, cough it up or spit it out
Oh my God I'm flipping out, flipping out then dipping out
I tried to turn the fuckin' page, oh my God, I ripped it out

I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago, lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah, run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?

I used to know you niggas, I don't know you niggas
I just ignore you niggas, I don't bro you niggas
With my bros will smoke you niggas, like we grow you niggas
Kill your ho too nigga, and your go-to niggas
I've been riding 'round the city with the safety off
Glock nine and it's pretty like a baby doll
You niggas bitches and it's pissing all the ladies off
My finger sitting on the trigger like a La-Z-Boy
If there was beef, I'm in the kitchen with the apron on
Put his words on the plate, that nigga ate 'em all
And I ain't wit' the talking, but damn now he talking
Nigga spilled the beans, damn, now it's coffee
Looking for your pussy ass like I got a warrant
I throw on the ski mask, that's a private party
Bullets jumping off your ass like they shock absorbant
Rock your bells, LL, nigga locked and loaded

I used to smoke to get high now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the beast side
I feel like Ivan Drago lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah, run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
Used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side

If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah, run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?

Mulah, baby

Was he playing with the gun or was it an accident
I still... I just don't.... I.... I be wanting to ask him but I never asked him after all these years

Rims big, make the car look like it's two stories
If I hop out, that'd be suicide
No back seats, call that paralyze
I don't have a spine, I don't fantasize
I mastermind, then go after mine
You see, I handle mine, I dismantle mine
I tote a tool box, bitch, it's hammer time
So excuse me as I nail 'em 'til some fell
I'm just repel 'em, I'ma kill 'em, someone tell 'em I'ma kill 'em
I'ma fill 'em up, his mama can't tell 'em
And the doctors can't heal 'em
I'ma kill 'em and, yeah, we sell 'em, I know you smell 'em
And if you want it, you could just yell it

I'ma take it one-two, way back
Like a silk wife beater and a wave cap
Or the wave pool at Blue Bayou
And I waved, fool, as I blew by you
Hello, hi, you, I can buy you
But I wouldn't try you, feed you to Piru
I know what I'm doing, I show and prove and show improvement
And I know just to go into it, could never amount to going through it
Whatever, how you wanna do it, we can do it like we late
Ayy, wait, Deezle, let me just get the 808

On the hunt for the lamb, I'ma dump 'em, man
In a dumpster can
You ain't a soldier, ask Uncle Sam, hair nappy like Pam
Nigga, fuck your plan, fuck your man
You ain't a pimp unless you get the same bitch
To fuck your man and fuck your clan
And all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh, goddamn, there's my sample
Play it like that's my band
Gotta get it cleared, suck my dick
With red lipstick and don't let it smear
And I got a lot of tattoos
And I meant every tear
And I'm still on that street shit
Back to the beat, bitch

All the lines, we crossed 'em
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
I O. J. Simpson that pussy
Ha, yeah, that's the shit
Pussy taste so good, make you smack your lips
I don't know about you, but I'm a beast with mine
She say she waitin' for the Carter 69, ha
Ha, I told her, "Sorry for the wait"
I value her time like an Audemars Piguet
And we gon' stay current like the water in a lake
Yeah, we gon' fuck around like we fuckin' in a circle
Ha, pardon the slur, that's the purple
It feels so real like it's virtual
Any kind of position, she's versatile
And she take it every way except personal, haha
Yeah, that's my bitch
Pussy wetter than a wishin' well, I wish
I was in it right now instead of makin' this song
Hut one, hut two, I run it in the end zone
Don't trip when I say I can't see ya
And she say she workin' on her career
Smoke got our eyes lookin' like we're from Korea
We floatin', but I'ma rock the boat like Aaliyah
RIP, shorty got me
And shorty knows I fucks with her, hard body
Shorty fine by me, spend some time by me
It's a jungle out there, come and climb my tree
I know what's on your mind, fine
Yeah, we can do whatever that is
She tell me that it's mine, I say, "Fine"
Shit, I was taught to live and let live
So go and live it up, baby, giddy-up, baby
It's your world, ain't tryna interrupt, but maybe
We movin' too fast, but, fuck it, let's crash
One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past
But for now it feel lovely, it feel great
I slide her: safe, ha
Yeah, yeah, all that good shit
No, I ain't a player, I just play it by the bullshit
I know what I'm doin', and she love how I do it
She throw that ass back and she never over-do it
Ha, she call me "baby" and I call her "bae"
Sorry for the wait, Carter IV on the way
August 29

Hahahaha
Yeah
Fuck with me Drizzy

[Song 88: Moment]
77 ContributorsMoment LyricsTrack #10 is a solo track by Wayne from Young Money’s “Young Money: Rise Of An Empire” album.
Turn the music on
They say baby how you do it
Never question greatness, never question greatness
Tell 'em never question greatness
I just do it
I'm so high I feel weightless
All my shooters are courageous, and

Ain't a moment 'til I make it
It ain't a moment 'til I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
They got niggas catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
(Shoot it if I wave it)
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

Know you see me in that Rolls Royce, glass house, that nigga, hands down
No givin' up, no layin' down, all red, ant pile
My oldest son just turned five, I said "Lil nigga, you a man now"
Ride around with that strap out cause my Rolls Royce, glass house
I just got a text that said "Baby I just cashed out"
Whack weed get ashed out, put Persian rugs in the crack house
All y'all that lashed out, I'll come see what that's 'bout
But you don't need to call the fireman, to put a mothafuckin' match out
I can't remember my last drought, all my niggas' smashmouth
Got pure coke, brand new birds, we get 'em as soon as they hatch, slime
And you know the driveway too big when you ain't gotta back out
Paper chase like cat mouse, my nigga it

Ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
They got niggas catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

Know you see me cause my roof all in my trunk
Know he dead when the horn honk
Niggas say they kings, they lyin', boy you talkin' to a card shark
I already made my mark, please don't think I just pop corks
Got these voices in my head screamin', can't believe they're not hoarse
Bitch I've been a beast since cartoon sheets
It's real on the field, I need new cleats, outgrew these
Catch you while you sleep, turn your sheets to maroon sheets
Them choppers turn your homeboys into amputees
And that's not a good look, momma was a chef, but daddy cooked the work
Said "I know it stank but it's good"
Look, we treat them triggers like repeat buttons
Leave it all out there, or leave nothin'
Like the world a crystal ball, I keep rubbin' it

Ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
I don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
They got people catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

Can't nobody save yah
New Orleans pride and savior
Nigga this that Carter 5
I feel like, feel like I'm on my final caper
Uh, and I'm about to smoke one, pass out, OG kush, hashed out
She only want alcohol and trees, fuck that, you gotta branch out
I camp out by a rat house, wait 'till he turn the lamp out
Still drownin' in the fuckin' money, y'all niggas look like y'all swam out
In this bitch, gats out in this bitch
She say she can come and help my fat wallet get fit
I told her that's not in this script, I don't see that in the script
I'm smokin', gettin' head, lookin' down tryna read lips

Ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
Niggas I had you catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
(Shoot it if I wave it)
I tell myself
Ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'

Unlike Bill Gates, he doesn’t have to bang narsty Melinda
Uh-huh, yeah

Skinny ass pants, fresh pair of Vans
If them niggas keep tripping they can share an ambulance
Throw up blood with my hands
My gang popping niggas
Smoke that Kiesha, not that Reggie
For you name dropping niggas
All day I do it, I do it like Tony
Got a sign on my dick that say "Bad Bitches Only"
I don't drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt
Man, I'm on that Patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go pew
Got a mean-ass swagger, my bitches do too
Yeah, all my niggas nuts, and I'm a loose screw
Bitch, I get big bucks, pockets on Bruce Bruce
Yeah, I talk that shit, bitch, I got bread, bitch, I got toast
Welcome to The Murder Show — I am the motherfucking host
They call me Weezy F. Baby, yes, I do the fucking most
I'm at their throats until they choke
The God has spoke
I need a smoke break
(Smoke break…)

Now let it breathe, Tune, yeah
It go; all these bitches, and niggas still hating
I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gating
Got a list full of problems, I'll tend to them later
Yeah, life is a bitch, but I appreciate her, man
All these bitches and niggas still hating
Yeah, I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gating
Got a list full of problems, I'll tend to them later
Yeah, life is a bitch, but I appreciate her, man

It go; dark-ass shades, I can't see them haters
Now eat these fucking bullets, don't forget to tip the waiter
Dress like a skater, ride on you like Shaun White
I'm high all day, you can call that shit a long flight
Every night's a long night, every day's a holiday
I don't fuck with squares, now do that mean I'm out of shape?
Yes, I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate
Weezy fuck the world, yep, I fuck it 'til it ovulate
Get her to the crib, get in that pussy and just dominate
Weezy F. Baby, and the 'F' is for 'Fornicate'
Polo Ralph Lauren, bitch, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate
Boogers in the bezel of my watch with the vomit face
And still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
Pistol in your mouth, I can not make out what you trying to say
And if they want a war, then tell them motherfuckers "Bombs away"

Man, all these bitches, and niggas still hating
Man, I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gating
Got a list full of problems — I'll tend to 'em later
And life is a bitch, but I appreciate her
Man, all these bitches, and niggas still hating
And I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gating
Got a list full of problems — I'll tend to 'em later

Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'ma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

I say damn I must be left
'Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

Now she don't know about me but I'ma put her on it
And she ain't sure about me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight

With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

Rock pianist Elew breaks down the beautiful piano and claims that both he and Wayne improvised the whole song.

*lighter flick*
Yeah
Yeah

I'm in the crib butt-naked, bitch
She say my dick could be the next Black president
Americans hate that I'm American
Medicine, I treat it like peppermints
Ugh, I'm in the ocean getting shark pussy
Shoot you in your fucking mouth and make you talk to me
Yeah, sometimes, I need someone to talk to
'Cause I am not a human being—part two!
Getting paid show money for walkthroughs
Letting all these hoes ride my dick: carpool
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Ugh, what your man doing?
I pop his motherfucking top like a canned good
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed
And last night, I took a transformer
And had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron
But my girl was sleeping with Decepticons
Money talks, man, and mine talk lecture-long
P-U-S-S-Y: my second home
I be grinding on them hoes like a half-pipe
She say, "Tunechi, you the shit; you need your ass wiped"
I say, "Before you gas me up, check the gas price"
Then I make her take this dick like advice, hahaha
She seesaw it, she suck it and enjoy it
I stick it in her ass like some fucking steroids
Jose Canseco, make no mistake
Like a white boy wearing black paint, you're a fake-ass nigga
Brake pads, nigga, wait
You ain't in my weight class, nigga
Looking for the motherfucking man in the mirror
Running this shit like a faucet: Farrah
Barra-cuda, who the fuck you are?
I can make your bitch root for me like I grew her
Bodies in the sewer, tampons in manure
Ninety billion bitches on my stick like a skewer, that's swag
I'm a true Blood, bitch, no fangs
Been went pro, now I'm going pro-pane
Tell a bitch, "Get off me!" Bitch, get off me!
I got her over here blowing me like coffee
Decaffeinated, hand me that paper like I graduated
And I get head while it's decapitated, haha
Think it's a game? Nigga, come play
I'm with my killer Bs, fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta
I personally know strangers, it's so strange
But this girl named Dana like to go anal
Shoot him in his head—what's that? A no-brainer
Plain ol' nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve, so don't be breaking my arm
I'd rather wring your fucking neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me along with him
I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, your ass is grass—get a lawn chair
I was fucking before my dick started growing hair
Bitches sweating me like John Mayer or warm air
Man... Nuts and bananas
You know how the tables turn, where are your table manners?
If you fake, put a egg in your shoe and scramble
No rubber, I just fucked this piano, nigga!

Lew!
Do you!
Whoa!
Turn it up!
Mm!
Yeah!
Hello World!
As I always say...
I...
Am not...

Bad bitch in mi casa
No mi casa su casa
My choppa go Doom-dada
Dayahyahyahda!

Tunechi, bitch
On my Future shit
I'm too legit
I sleep on a crucifix
I wake up cranky and turn into a lunatic
Then shoot my bitch
Behind orange juice and grits
Uzi clip
I need another Uzi clip
I shoot to kill
These pussy niggas shooting bricks
I'm too for real
Your head just a souvenir
She wanna get it off her chest
But her boobs too big
I'm bumping Carter V
On a iPod
My bitch mad as hell cause it ain't out yet
She said "Soon as these niggas hear your new shit
They gon' have to give they styles back"
I said "You too cray"
She said "You too humble"
I said "You too, bae"
She said "You too sweet"
Then I ask her do she go both ways
She say "They do say love is a two-way street"
I say "Oooh"
Talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty, talk dirty to me
Treat that girl like cuisine
She gon' wanna shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum
I'm gon' die on my feet
Never knees in the dirt
Never dirt on my knees
I'm just serving these fiends
Sell birds to the bees
I sell birds to the trees
"Tune, I heard you don't sleep"
I'm allergic to dreams
I don't twerk, but I tweak
For that purple, that pink
Yeah you see what I'm saying
Like you heard what you see
I'm a verbal disease
I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets
Since my curtains was sheets
Chef on these beats
I'm just stirring the grease
That bitch you in love with
She working for me
I personally
Get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my two fingers
I'm at peace
Word
I smirk when I squeeze
Trigger smart, street smart
I'm a nerd, I'm a geek
I'm absurd, I'm unique
Did my time at Cash Money
Time served and released
But this agent ain't free
Word
That's the word on these streets
But that shit is old news
That shit's so yesterweek
I'm just focused
Focused on my expertise
They like "Tunechi, you good?"
I'm like "Bob, yessiree!"
Now don't, I mean don't
Don't question me
Let me breathe
Dog, big dog
I cock back and shoot at ya fleas
Money long – Tree trunk
Now stand under me
Catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees
But repeat what you heard
You a dead parakeet
It's Tunechi, bitch
Your bitch Tunechi's bitch
I fuck her on my balcony
We watch the moon eclipse
We do unusual shit
She gonna need lube for this
'Cause I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world
She like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant
She doing lines like a movie script
But these are true events
Lord
I'll kill a nigga right now
I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than
These niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth
I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up at the skyline
I'm thinking to my fuckin' self
"You only live twice, slime"
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place with a high crime rate, like Iran
We put your ass on Nightline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline
But they never tried mine
Spittin' like I'm sippin' cyanide
While my bitch sip a Mai Tai
But she wine fine
And I'm so sorry
She say "Don't be sorry"
Woo
Then she say "Don't apologize for shit
'Cause you the shit
And we know Tha Carter V the shit"
Woah
Woo

But this is that Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga
Glock 40 for them fake niggas
Throw a party every day, nigga

What's up with your fist game? You'll catch a hook, fish hang
Watch me cock the Nina—call that rough sex
Knock your head off, you just a rough neck
And if I'm shootin' at ya, nigga, all net
Ain't no world peace, just Ron Artest
Dick-in-the-booty–ass nigga
Die-quick-in-a-movie–ass nigga
Extra-fruit-in-the-smoothie–ass nigga
Get beat like a drum: music class, nigga—brrrr!
Life is a gamble, dyin' is your best bet
Got a scope on the pistol—give your ass fresh breath
Give my fist a kiss, nigga
Tunechi

Fuck with me wrong, take me out my zone

(Beat the shit out that pussy-ass nigga)

Ugh, what's really good, nigga? I'm feelin' good, nigga
Rest in peace lil' Wesley Wes—a pussy-ass nigga always kill a good nigga
I'm high as Heaven, I'll pop the reverend and stop the wedding
Got more money than memories in the bank—don't forget it
Clean 'em up, my team is up; I'm high as Scotty, beam me up
They say we all gotta pay the price—fuck it, man, ring me up
Fuckin' right, I skate, ho; pussy is my scapegoat
And all these pussy-ass niggas that's hatin', kiss my ass: besos
I'm a genius, take notes, I'll split your egg to the egg yolk
I'll be dead before I be dead broke; still burn money: my bread toast
Fuck it, if you got it, spend it, nigga, but just keep your two pennies, nigga
Start shit and I'll end it, nigga; don't open your mouth, I'm a dentist, nigga
Lil' Tunechi
Give my fist a kiss, nigga (So—)

This motherfucking D’usse got me sweating and shit...
Word to God
Hov, fuck with ya boy
C5

Okay nigga, I got 'em, point 'em out and I got 'em
Let 'em get a lil buzz, then we robbing for pollen
We ain't killing no minors, you niggas still in the minors
And your bitch, we gonna blind her, can't pick us out of the lineup
I swear lord knows I'ma murk one of these niggas
Shoot you in your earth, and get earthworms on me, nigga
I been did my time, I'm getting better with time
But real niggas don't whine, we'll burn down your vineyard
I been balling since cornrows, still ducking the narcos
My little niggas in war mode, you spark it up, we charcoal
Got a bad bitch with long hair that have bad days when the mall closed
I'm a big dog, big doghouse, make ashtrays out of dog bowls, yeah
Blessings on top of sins, resting with topless twins
Picture me broke but forgot to take the top off the lens
In the restaurant, I’m with Slim, wrestling with lobster limbs
Talking  about some M's, it's sounding like gospel hymns
Yes, lord

We on that D'usse, me and my nigga Euro
Tina turn up in this bitch
We got Lauren in this bitch
Serena Pink in this bitch, better known as Pinky

Yah dig?
What’s up Brandon!?

Hollygrove nigga, rest in peace, Lil Kevin
Rest in peace, Lil Beezy, rest in peace, Big Sausage
The world is mine, I am selfish
I am a shark, fuck them shellfish
Everybody in the building, well I left that bitch like Elvis
Nigga, please
Pops treated mom like Billie Jean
Like hot sauce, I put it on everything
I'ma give that fucking woman everything, everything
Here we go, bitch I'm cool, Coolio
She say "Tune, do me slow"
How many fish did Hootie blow?
I don't know, fuck who knows?
I got a redbone with two golds
And she snort too much of that Michael Jackson
That bitch gonna need a new nose
I ain't got time for you hoes
Shit I only have two goals
And that is "Get Money, Get Money"
Now I'm riding 'round the city with the top off the Maybach
Looking for a motherfucking spot we can skate at
Elvis left the building and I take these hoes to Graceland
And I got more bounce, to the 28 grams
I ain't stunting these niggas
Eyes look Chinese, Wayne-chung to these niggas
Wayne-chung bitch!
More than one bitch
This for my niggas, we shall overcome, bitch
From New Orleans, niggas dying over dumb shit
You know we give the pastor hell, make the nun strip
Yeah I might have them bricks, call me Brick Cannon
Nina on my lap, what you want from Santa?
I might get money, fuck bitches
Kill niggas and smoke weed
I'm married to this real shit
And I'm a wife beater, no sleeves
Do it for my hood
That 44 ain't no good
You better bring that chopper
Cause we gonna have them choppers
Yeah I do it for my hood
That 45 ain't no good
You better bring the chopper
Cause we gonna have them choppers, nigga
We gonna have them choppers
We gonna have them choppers
You better bring the chopper

We gonna have them choppers
You better bring the chopper
Cause we gonna have them choppers, nigga
Mula!

My nigga Hood in this bitch
Still on that D'usse
Shout out my nigga Lil Twist, my lil brother
He just passed out in the club the other night off that D'usse
Threw up on the owner
Owner talkin' about he wanted his money back
He wanted half of the money back
Twist took all the money and left
That's some Young Money shit
Soo Woo to the B gang
Rest in peace Cedar Frogg

[Song 96: Dr. Carter]

Where's my coffee?
Good morning, Dr. Carter (Hey, sweetie)
Looks like it's gonna be a long day
Ahh, another one huh? What we got
Your first patient (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concepts (Uh-huh)
Originality (Ugh)
His flow is weak (Another one)
And he has no style (Ugh)
What you got for him? (Tssss, okay)

Let me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on
Dr. Carter to the rescue
Excuse me if I'm late, but like a thief it takes
Time to be this great, uhh, so just wait
Your style is a disgrace, your rhymes are fifth place
And I'm just grace, one, uno, ace
And I'm trying make your heart beat like bass
Hmm-mm, but you're sweet like cake
And I come to fix wherever your shell break
Where is your originality? You are so fake
So picture me like a gallery, capture what I say
All I need is one mic, all I need is one take
Like, hey, brighter than a sun ray
Got a pistol on a playground, watch the gun-play
Like, no kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say
Gotta work everyday, gotta not be cliché
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei
You gotta have faith, you gotta, gotta
Wait, wait, I think I, I think I lost him
(Dial 118 please)

Good afternoon, Dr. Carter (Nurse)
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down, vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lacks respect for the game
(Uh, let me see)
You think you can save him?

Okay, respect is in the heart, so that's where I'ma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
But, hey kid, plural, I graduated
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling, r-e-reciting something
'Cause you just like it, so you say it just like it
Some say it's biting but I say it's enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing
So I stopped writing, now I'm like lightning
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titan
Fast and exciting, my passion is frightening
Now let me put some more vocab in your IV
Here, take this Vicodin, like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind, I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it
I don't do it 'cause I done it, and I'm in the emergency un-it
God dunnit I've lost another one

Good evening, Dr. Carter. It's been a long day
But this one looks much better than the others
His respect is back up, concepts sound good
His style is showing strong signs of improvement
All he needs now is his swagger
Okay, let me take my gloves off then
Swagger tighter than a yeast infection
Fly, go hard, like geese, erection
Fashion patrol, police detection
Eyes stay tight like Chinese Connection
I stay tight like pussy at night
Baby, don't get me wrong, I could do that pussy right
But I'm too wrong to write, too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle, too paid to freestyle
Had to say it twice, swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast, I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words
In the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
That swagger, I got it, I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow, his blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow, this one's starting to show
Strong signs of life, where's the stitches? Here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open, I reply "What a night"
"Welcome back, Hip-Hop, I saved your life"

He looks good, his vitals are up
He's looking good, he's looking good
I think we got one
Dr. Carter, I think we got one
Yep, yep, we got one, we saved him, he's good
He's good, we got one, he's good
He's good, we got him
We saved him, he's a go
He's good

[Song 97: Romance]
46 ContributorsRomance LyricsOn this song, Wayne describes what seems to be his own personal idea of a perfect relationship with a girl.
I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
I fucked you on your job, and that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
And I don't give a fuck, but I got to, I got to yeah yeah
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut
And that's romance, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
We fuck and crash that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
Ok

Fuck my hand, suck my thumb
Be a lady and buy me lunch
Send me cards, make me read
But don't send me no flowers unless it's weed
Cause I'm that nigga, she say Im that nigga
She ain't got a man but act like I'm that nigga
She check my phone, what's that 'bout?
Any other ho I would've cursed her ass out
But that's romance, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
She kiss my ankle when I twisted my ankle
She even did anal when she don't do anal
My bitch, I'm thankful, let's hold hands (Can we?)
Let's slow dance (shall we?)
And we gon be like 1, 2, 1, 2
She said Im the one, girl you the one too
I stand up in that pussy like a sunroof
Yeah

I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
I fucked you on your job, and that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
And I don't give a fuck, but I got to, I got to yeah yeah
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut

Ok, now give me coochie at my mama's crib
On Thanksgiving everybody's listening
All your home girl's bad and they're our guest
Let'em all in and I'll play chef
That's romance cause we so real
She said she cannot take the pain, if it ain't a pill
She said fuck these hoes, they just mad
We fucked a ho together, that's romance
If you got cups then I got dranks
I take my rubber off and put that money in the bank
I ain't your friend, fuck that shit
Tryna find another me girl good luck with that shit
Cause

I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
I fucked you on the table, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
And I don't give a fuck but baby I got to, I got to yeah yeah
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut

62 ContributorsRun This Town LyricsWeezy’s “super”-freestyle uses the beat from Jay-Z’s Grammy-winning sensation!
Yeah
Millzy, I see you
T told me, "Do this shit"
So I'ma do this shit
No Ceilings!
Yeah, haha
Hahaha
I'ma run this town tonight
All right, now
Ugh

Nigga, we are so ready for the war
C-A-R-T-E-R, put the beat in ER
I'm colder than "B-R," add another three Rs
Watch me like DVD/VCR
Pump to your chest, I ain't talking CPR
Riding this track like a motherfucking streetcar
New Orleans coroner—his name is Frank Minyard
Fuck with me wrong, you'll be waking up in his yard
Man, I go crazy on the beat, I go nimrod
Man, I act a ass, treat the beat like a hem'rrhoid
Man, I go to work on the beat, call it "employed"
Man, I kicks it, bitch, get your shinguard! Ugh
Young Money run this—towns, countries
I still eat rappers—mmm, scrumptious
My goons tote thumpers, they pump 'em like krumpers
Anybody beat, I'm gon' go Archie Bunkers
Tunechi be the wildest, let's run the metropolis
I pop like lollys, you drop like eyelids
The money keep calling, I hear the shit dialing
And they say money talks, you can hear my shit holl'ing
You softer than ny-lin; oops, I meant "nylon"
Perfection is the goal, and I'm headed to the pylon
Crown fit me good, I ain't even got to try on
The pistol mean business—that bitch should have a tie on
T done told me, "Do this shit," so I had to do this shit
I get superhero money, call a nigga "super-rich"
Keep it "super" for a while, let me get on my "super-" shit
Super-ill, super-sick—dawg, I go super-Vick
Ran into a superwoman, turned her to a super-bitch
Hit her with that super-dick, she be coming super-quick
Super-Millz, Mack, Tyga, Streets, 'Nelly, Super Nick'
Super-Drizzy, Gudda, Chuckee, Twist, that's the super-clique
Now, I'm off that "super" shit, fuck that shit, I super-quit
Running circles 'round the game, like a hula hoop and shit
You gon' have to loop this shit, there won't be a duplicate
And my blunts be super-thick, I'm higher than a Supra kick
I—I'm the bomb, baby, watch me nuke this shit
When I leave the booth, they gotta scoop this shit
My apologies, diabolically
I'm the prodigy—do you roger me?
I look in the flames and see a hotter me
But how come I'm still colder than common-ly?
Yeah, we run this town, like a lot of feet
Young Mula, baby; I'm proud of me

Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see? (MonstaBeatz)

My-my scene just a crime scene
Got the high beams and the sirens, yeah
My team, we divide teams
Talkin' dirty money? Check the hygienes
All the dirty money get dry cleaned
Talkin' dirty money, Sam Rothstein
Had my goons kidnap your offsprings
While I was working on my golf swing
Ooh, sweet dreams, sour nightmares
It's a cold world, I got an ice grill
No one man should have all that power
If he can't afford to pay the light bill
I got a forcefield over my heartbeat
The window seal with no door key
I'm poppin' pills to feel more me
Cut off the wings now I'm soaring
And I never feel like poor me
I'd rather feel like the old me
I was born with wheels and I roll deep
I could make the devil get cold feet
Don't light the clove unless it's four leaf
Get a pussy wetter than a coral reef
On my face, I tatted me a fleur-de-lis
Should I get it covered with a coca leaf?
I could tell you better than you showed me
I could show you better than you told me
I'm an OG up in OT
And it's no sleep 'til it's roast beef
I better not hear a Little Bo-Peep
Better go figure, better go deep
Pass no judgement, pass your weed
I'm the GOAT nigga, no goatee

Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see?

Mmm, sippin' on purple like it's herbal
Bad brown bitch, Lisa Turtle
On turbo, you don't wan' disturb him
Momma put too much sugar in my Gerber
Damn, I done dropped too many ashes on my turban
I done seen so many titties on Bourbon
Live a different kind of lifestyle
Different color diamonds, got a nigga lookin' like sherbert
Stepped to the plate, knocked it out the park
Eat a nigga face like a tiger shark
Dressed in all red like Olajuwon
My niggas hit your safe like the Holocaust
My niggas catch a case, feel like I got Moss'd
My nigga treat the K just like a loft
Got a lawyer and an agent but I'm the boss
And my heart always racin' but never lost
Hello? I was the illest nigga on child support
Now I'm lookin' at the Robb Report
Went and looking at the final score
Bedroom got revolvin' doors
Bitches in and out smilin' more
Than children smilin' at a carnival
Ain't got nothing in common but the common cold
Big Bs nigga, honor roll
Hold up, I think I found the flow
Started from the bottom bitch
Never been monogamous, never been monotonous
Never been anonymous, money is eunonymus
Always had accomplices, always had conglomerates
Always let the chopper clip stick out like a bottom lip
You runnin' out of time so you better know what time it is
You runnin' out of tears and you runnin' out of volunteers
Young Mula bitch, I die for the logo
Cocaine price low, call that a low blow
Tunechi like Pablo, kis in the rowboat
Tunechi in the yacht though, still don't showboat
Sippin' on the slowpoke, movin' like a tugboat
Smokin' like a steamboat, fuckin' on a love boat
Better read the ransom note before you read the love note
Don't know if it's sore throat, deep throat or cut throat

Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see?

Oh why am I so kamikaze
Why can't I stay in my seat? I'm so hyphy
Try me, why do I see these bloody bodies?
Why do I love what I see?
Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?
R.I.P
If you can't live in peace, then you can die in peace
As your eyes close and mines bleed, I need Vizine

[Song 100: FuckWitMeYouKnowIGotIt]
86 ContributorsFuckWitMeYouKnowIGotIt LyricsLil Wayne remixes “FuckWitMeYouKnowIGotIt” from Jay Z’s 2013 album, Magna Carta… Holy Grail.
I mean it's simple
Can't fuck wit' us

I got money on yo' head, I don't do my dirty work
I cut off my hands, I don't even touch the work
I pray these niggas don't fuck with me and I don't like to curse in church
And my girl pussy taste just like Mrs. Butterworth's
I mean that, believe that

Don't be short with that work, nigga
We find out where yo' ho work, nigga
We follow your moms from church, nigga
You gonna have to swallow yo' pride like a thirst quencher
Get 'em Tune, I don't really fuck around with certain niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
These niggas hustling backwards
Check your rear-view mirror and your side mirrors
OG Kush keep my mind clearer
That choppa get yo' mind right
I got two choppers, that's chopsticks
Eat yo' block up like shrimp fried rice
Been so long since I seen my eyes white
You know I smoke like dry ice
Better stay in your lane or get sideswiped
It's going down, let me straighten up and fly right
Still can't turn a ho into a housewife
Man, it's like some things will never change
You ain't got a shot in a gun range
These chumps ain't even got chump change
Uh, yeah, and don't fuck with me, you know I'm Gotti
Check yourself before I sign it
Yeah, I'm shinin' on these niggas, no horizon
Yeah, and it's going down if I'm her pilot
Uh, my new car is so robotic
My new bitch is so provided, money talks, yours like no comment
Black car, racial profiling, rest in peace to Christopher Wallace
Desert Eagle like the Mojave, I get my work from Rico Suave
Uh, it's a Rollie if I got time on my hand
If you ever see me broke, write on my cast
Boy, my weed so good, I cry when it's gone
Had a phone in jail, that's a cellphone
Yeah, I'm 'bout to buy a machine gun
We drink it all, leave clean cups, make mountains look like speed bumps
I'm sittin' on some train tracks, hopin' that bitch speed up
I'm strong-arming these niggas, roll my sleeves up, yeah
I got bad bitches on standby, all my hoes got cat eyes
Celebrate when a rat die, make a nigga fall back like he getting baptized
Put me in a hospital room, full of flat lines, I'm Tunechi Lee immortal
My name ringing, my name ringing, hello may I take your order?
I say, Testarossa over testimony
Got so much shit built up, you could smell it on me
Fuck all y'all niggas in Swahili, nigga
Ain't nothing free 'round here but Willy, nigga
AK-47, call it Mr. Biggs
All my niggas bloods, fuck your syringe
Chop his head off, put it in the fridge
Try not to mistake that shit for dinner, Dedication

Hey let me introduce you niggas to America's Most
Every nigga 'round with me carry a tote
Sadity bitches, like a nigga Tune on the low
They just be like 10 and be doing the most
Okay, Tune in the jet flyin' over the boat
I'm on the way from the Panama, I got a few on the boat
What you niggas make a year, I could do with the blow
You keep on playin' with me, bet I'll put a few in you, ho
The fate of a fuck nigga, we soon to see
These niggas sweet as perfume to me
I mean, really, like cartoon to me
Ain't nobody fuckin' with Tune and me
Hustle Gang, bang green, in God we trust
Young Money, Cash Money, they down with us
I got a bitch who want you bitch, you finna give the ho up
And don't buck, shawty listen, you don't really know us
We a bust a nigga head, leave him layin' for dead
I get caught with a banger, I'ma lay in the feds
In gen. pop., nigga, every day in the feds
I was chillin' on the yard, really going hard
And these pussy niggas catchin' feelings over broads
King, pussy nigga, but I'm really like a god
A-Town nigga, Bankhead, I'm about it
Everybody know to fuck with me 'cause I got it

71 ContributorsDays and Days LyricsThe third track from Lil Wayne’s tenth studio album featuring rapper 2 Chainz.
You leave your home for days and days
Yeah (Hey)

Money ain't shit, bitches ain't neither (But hey)
You know I'm on that grass, don't cut on the sprinklers (But hey)
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers (But hey)
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeño (Hey)
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket (But hey)
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip (But hey)
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter (But hey)
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat
I go tapeworm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big-headed, my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes
Lil Tunechi (Hey)

(But hey) Yeah, 2 Chainz (But hey)
I might book me for a show (But hey)
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough (But hey)
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class pictures (But hey)
I like math, all I did was add bitches (Hey)
Swagga galore, got your girl on all fours (But hey)
It's not doggystyle, I call it froggystyle (Hey)
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in (Hey)
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me (With me)
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it (Damn)
Everything authentic (Tru), plus I named my pistols
Last name "Fuck," first name "I Don't Give A" (Bah)
Pockets look pregnant, they 'bout to deliver
So when I start pimpin', you know the procedure, yeah

You leave your home for days and days
Alright, uh (Hey)

All my niggas gangstas, all my bitches freaks (But he—)
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink (Hey)
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat (But hey)
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat (But hey)
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious (But—)
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss, I'ma need some more S's
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
'Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered
These niggas think they hard, these niggas just nipples
I pop a nigga like a 'sicle, drop a nigga like a missle
Mo' money mo' issues, I size you up then fit you

I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess

But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more ones, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

Yes, no pressure, it’s a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into Petrol
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more ones, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

Yes, fuck it, more ones, fuck it, more ones
Fuck it more ones, fuck it, more ones
I'm​ making a mess with all of these ones
Fuck it, more ones, fuck it, more ones
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more ones

Yeah, yeah
Mmm...

I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women
Puttin' cups up, gettin' fucked up

And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, "Why you leave your shit here?"
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout "What about how she feel?"
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
"Baby where my keys at?"
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked

I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

I was talkin' to myself the other day
My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, "Pray"
She say, "I need a day", I said, "I need a bae"
She said, "Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way"
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say "Don't sweat your alarm"
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, "Let go my arm!"
She said...

I don't know who you are anymore​
Talking to the man in her mirror
I've been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
And she say, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

She say, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's what's fucked up

She say we don't make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, now it's painless
We actin' like strangers
Like we don't know who we are anymore
Perfect strangers

StreetRunner
So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're driving down the streets of gold
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire
Ha!

Momma always told me I was crazy
And my hoes say I'm amazing, but I don't listen to a lady
But the bitch say I'm hot, and I say "No bitch, I'm blazing"
Like, what the fuck you expect? I'm a motherfucking Cajun
I feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doing time
I goes crazy inside, but when it comes out—it's fine
Like wine; wait, watch...
See? I get better with time like a watch
Osh B'Gosh, Posh Spice husband
Couldn't kick it like I kick it, bitch! I Kix it
No cereal, like a landing, I sticks it
Wherever she asks me, after she licks it
"That's too explicit"; well, why you listening?
*Sniff* I smell smoke, and something's sizzling
That's her pussy
So, hey, pussy; play with pussy or play pussy

But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire
Hahahaha!

They say, "You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
Well, where I'm from, you're nobody 'til you kill somebody
And you know what they say; when you great
It's not "murder," it's "assassinate"
So assassinate me, bitch
'Cause I'm doing the same shit Martin Luther King did
Checking in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch
Same balcony, like, "Assassinate me, bitch!"
It's Lil Tunechi
I don't rap, I film movies
With my rap, you could call me
"Mr. Director's Chair," yeah, and that's a wrap
Cut! On to the next...
Not the next scene, bitch, the next check
Some say the X makes the sex 'spec-
So play with the pussy or play pussy

So you've got so many diamonds
Hey, pussy, lay pussy
You wear all the finest clothes
Do what I... say, pussy, and I say, I say
And your grill is shining
Lay pussy, lay pussy, lay, pussy, haha
As you're driving down the streets of gold
Hey, pussy, haha!
But you can't blame me
Hey pussy, don't play pussy
If I set this stage on fire!
Get 'em!

Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart, bitch, like the times are medieval
Married to the game, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you, straight to the needles
The bottles, the battles, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita—I love you, Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat ya?
'Member when I went into the kitchen, got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck neither
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
He could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
And she don't play neither

But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire!

The beat is from Ice Cream Paint Job by Dorrough
B-T-P, yah
Is the AutoTune on?
Hmhmm, good
Mm

Young Money, syrup in the big shot
Time to do the thing, that's word to your wristwatch
Shoot the Glock 'til it burn, 'til my wrist lock
Rims hella big, tires skinny like Chris Rock
H—Hold the gun sideways like O-Dog
Shoot a nigga in his face, knock his nose off
Make the girls say my name like a roll call
Painkillers got a nigga 'bout to doze off
Big shit, nigga, talk big shit, nigga
Big bread, bread like a picnic, nigga
Shake the whole game like the Hit-Stick, nigga
Money spread like germs, get sick, nigga
Yeah, and fuck them other niggas
1-900, who want it? I deliver
Concrete shoes won't help in the river
I don't care if you was Michael Phelps, my nigga
I'm higher than the motherfucking Alps, my nigga
I'm flyer than the motherfucking stealth, my nigga
Y—Young Money shit, top shelf, my nigga
We the motherfuckers, like MILF, my nigga
Ahem, flow like syringes
Yeah, I'm in my mode, got a code like Da Vinci's
I was in the trenches, now I'm in the Trump
And everybody watch your back when you're in the front
You ain't never safe, stop playing with a gangsta
Brang it to his face, and he ran like a flanker
Bend the girl over, put her hands on her ankles
I'm all over this "Ice Cream" beat like sprinkles
"Why, thank you!"—if you's a hater
I'm eating, you's a waiter
Pistol on my hip, "Tomb Raider"
Holler at your guala, zoom, later
Young Tune, nigga; typhoon, nigga
And if you think it's sweet, buy a room, nigga
Damu, nigga, I'm on my gang shit
She give me good brain like she studied at Cambridge
Lighting up a motherfucking blunt
Stupid-fruity swag like a motherfucking Runt
And I be with my dog like a motherfucker hunt
And every day of the week is the first of the month
Audemars Piguet with the diamonds in the face
Can't tell the time 'cause the diamonds in the face
We can get it popping like a semi-automatic
And if you got beef, I put the biscuit on the patty
Rockstar tatted, big-money addict
Running this shit, now I'm feeling ath-lat-ic
I—I'm on a boat, bitch, getting seasick
Stop playing, I'm fresher than a Degree stick
Street shit—well, of course
I smoke mad weed, I'm on my high horse
Please, don't shoot me down, I land feet flat
Then walk a million miles with New Orleans on my back
Haha! I need a massage
And when it come to hoes, man, I got a collage
Finger on the button, nigga, just stuntin'
If you ain't the bank teller, don't tell me nothing
Kush so strong, you can smell me coming
Bitch, I go hard like the boy from "300"
You think y'all kick it, well, boy, we punting
Young Money, baby, we the shit, weak stomachs
No Ceilings, motherfucker

With a windshield full of tickets 'cause I live right by the station
I am tryna figure out why you so mad at me
Yes, I'm with Young Money, tell the magazines stop asking me

And a flag the color red like a fucking low battery

Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say "Who that?"
Big Bun Beeda but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (For real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix, man, just gon' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand with no easy fix, man (damn)
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar and hoes in the crib
Drank and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with P.A. so you know what it is
I'm sittin' on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
Said we do it for the Pimp so no holding back, let's go!

Look who crept in, crept-crept in
Look-look who crept in, look-look who
L-l-l-look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB 'til the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence, smack adolescents
Who ask who the best is, I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast, gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seem to get typecast
In the same role, Since 16 I ain't grow a day old
Yet my brain grow, cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper
Now it's Chandon, fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young, little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow-pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight
That my crown ain't for testing, testing
Chop heads off like King Henry the Eighth
Guillotine to your neck, bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wildin' dude
Studied Taoism and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet, seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
But yo, my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate, 'cause like my nigga Drake say
"We ain't got time to respond to niggas"

I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta when I pop up with them poppers, burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood, Bl-Blood Gang, five
It's that Blood Gang five but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fire
They actin' like they ain't gon' die, until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed Do-or-Die, from Watts to Larry Hoover, Chi'
Poverty and heroine, it's no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it's the green that we want
Cash Money is the company, and Weezy the boss!

They say I'm underrated (aha), but un-compete-with-able
Hm... Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable! (Shh!)
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask, is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth, got 'em sayin' "There he goes again!"
See now, they nominated
A nigga to come and flatten everything, now let me dominate it, nigga, run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything and make it complicated
Like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake 'em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain't no fakin', ain't no kind of mistaking how I be breakin' up everything
And be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (Damn!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I'm out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with "Tha Carter IV"

[Song 110: Mama Mia]
95 ContributorsMama Mia LyricsOn “Mama Mia”, Wayne tackles a hard-hitting instrumental as he flexes his lyrical muscles rapping about everything from having sex with females to coming through with his “shottas”.
What's good, brother?
Beat 'round the bush and I'ma come around with a bush cutter and look for you
You niggas talkin' too much shit
I'm about to find a good plumber
Y'all lil' niggas is some foot soldiers, I'm a foot fungus
You dead, brother
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button
The gun headbutt you like "Bang, bang, bang, bang"
'Til your heart stop drummin'
I shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer
But fall dawg, I knock a wall off with this sawed-off
This bitch sound like a hard cough
I'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts
Cut the hog head and the tail off
I'm the nigga bitches put a spell on
And once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball
Say slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9"
But I'm still starvin' like a skinny model in LA slime, that plate mine
Hooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime
I don't FaceTime with my new thang
New Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga
Dumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind
But I still see in the dark, nigga
Dark nigga, Akon
I'm on my shit like maggots
And they then they grow and they fly
Got real bitches with fake asses
With real views and fake eyes
It's stupid, I'm stupid
I'm out of my Kufi, narcotic abuser
No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'
Your partners is poodles
Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless
Titty-fuck your baby mama
She breastfeed your child while I do it, I'm stupid

Your crocodile's toothless
Titty-fuck your baby mama
She breastfeed your child while I do it, I looped it
(Mama Mia)

I'm out of my Tunechi, I'm mindin' my Tunechi
I'm shinin' my Uzi
They find 'em, I lose 'em, I'm hidin' out
Hopin' I don't smell like all these fuckin' vaginas I'm douchin'
Droppin' these jewels, it's precious like I'm droppin' my jewelry
I'm out of my Gucci, you not on my Gucci, that's not an exclusive
Designers, excuse me, massagers masseuse me
Oops, I mean masseuses massage me, I'm gruesome, I'm grimey
Turn you and lil' mami, to tuna salami
You pukin', she vomit, that's beautiful science
That's Tune in a Masi', that's who in a Hyundai
You stupid or drowsy? I pew in the 'Gatti
Pew, pew and I got 'em, pew, pew and I got 'em
Lil' Tunechi a shotta
Come through with my shottas, catch you and your thotta
Turn a nigga noodle to nada
Find it amusin', it's like it's a movie
This life is a movie, you died in the movie, I write and produce it
I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses
Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait
Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in
And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait
My money look Arabic, blunt lookin' Cuban
My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait
She European and she from Aruba, she from the States
Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate
We throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space
I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes
Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae
I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave
He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave
I'm ashin' on his head
He ain't got no credit and his Apple Card is dead
What's in your wallet?

(Mama Mia)

This song is often used as an example of… Read More 

We are at war with the universe
The sky is falling
And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
Da, da, da, da-da-da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da-da-da, da, da, da (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Yeah, some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometime that tragedy means it's over
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn

I work at the corner store
We all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly down low
No one's gonna save us now
How you feel, you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome, no

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny? (Oh-oh-oh)
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? (What have I done) What am I gonna be?

I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fate's not around, the luck's all gone
Don't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right
And I'ma tell you what's life, and did you know
I lost everything? But I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They try tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city underwater, some people still floating (Oh)
And they wonder why black people still voting (Ooh)
'Cause your president still choking (Oh yeah)
Take away the football team, the basketball team
Now all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit (Yeah, yeah)
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer (Yeah, yeah)
Let's pray

These friends, they come and go
But I got family, family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's nowhere to go
That there's no future, future
Don't make this here so low
And we can't overcome, no

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be? (What am I gonna be?)
What have I done so bad? (Oh) What is my destiny? (What have I done?)
You tie my hands (What have I done?), what am I supposed to see? (What have I done?)
What have I done so bad? (Ooh) What am I gonna be? (Oh, oh)

Yeah, and if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe, baby, God's got a blessing to spare (Oh)
Yes, I know the process is so much stress (Oh, come on, baby)
But it's the progress that feels the best
'Cause I came from the projects straight to success, and you're next
So try, they can't steal your pride, it's inside (Oh, woah)
Then find it and keep on grinding (Woah)
'Cause in every dark cloud, there's a silver lining, I know

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
See, right now we just riding on love, huh
(Take that money, make that money)
A shot in the dark
(Take that money)
We ain't tryin' to do nothing but hit the heart
(I can't wait to stop the wait, all of it)
We need love
(Love, okay)
That's all y'all, that's all

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
(Yeah, born right here in the USA)
What have I done so bad? (What have I done?) What is my destiny? (What have I done?)
(But, due to tragedy, looked on by the whole world as a refugee)
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see? (Tie me up)
(So accept my emotion)
What have I done so bad? (Tie me up) What am I gonna be? (Oh, oh-oh)
(Do not take it as an offensive gesture)
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
(It's just the epitome of my soul)
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny? (Oh, baby)
(And I must be me, we got spirit y'all, we got spirit)
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
(We got soul y'all, we got soul)
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?
(They don't want us to see, but we already know)

Carter IV, it's on
Yeah, it sound like that Lil', man, they be like "Wayne
That nigga right over there, that nigga's from another planet"
Cut the weed, pop-pop
Insanity shit, niggas from this planet can't see
U-u-u-u-uhh

Hot's what it is, watch what the kid drops
I'ma get the prop if you're not with the biz
Not only other regions, I really popped at the crib
So hatin' motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs
Off of the thizz, but I'm boss
It don't matter what the cost
When I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mid
Leavin' nothin' but mothers stuck and plus a coffin to give
What is happening is a merger, different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cookin' and I'm a server
Further, that's what I'ma get doing this
Remember when eating Gerber
Mama said to kill 'em all and I heard her
Thank you Baby for what became Lil Wayne
He's gettin' all the people knowin' that Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name, it's been a change in my lane
I'm a Klusterfuk and lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
And take a nigga's dame with no shame
Really be bussin' up, they thinkin' they thuggin' tough
But never do knuckle up, you in the gang, you bang
You drug and touchin' every thang, you lame
Sucka, you cannot sustain the reign
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Ballin' nigga, Strange Music, crew threw swishes
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
Well, you listenin' to Tecca Nina, Soo Woo bidness

Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black
I tell a nigga, "All those flows are borrowed"
It's the pharaoh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cairo, lookin' at stars
So bright in the sky, I thought they were marbles
No car doors, whatcha call those?
A whole carload, of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender
Please remember, don't feed the Simba
Three's assembled like nobody
He's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body
She's the only girl that was smart e-nough
To call me 'Mr. Benjamin' in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon; I pound it harder
How come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones? Well tonight then
We gon' do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It's important that you are more than
Welcome to Tha Carter IV and
Y'all enjoy it, I will go 'head
And I'll kiss y'all on y'all forehead, out

[Song 113: Shoot Me Down]
83 ContributorsShoot Me Down LyricsWayne asks his enemies not to shoot him down from his throne in hip-hop, while at the same time declaring he has no competition and that you couldn’t even hit him if you tried
Open up your hearts, people
Page one, chapter one, verse motherfucking one
Yeah, uh-huh
I'm drinking hot tea, bitch
Feel me

Yeah, now if you let me, you won't regret me
Shit, if you let me, you won't forget me
Remember? And if you don't then ponder
Hold up, bow! bow! there's a reminder
I ain't kinda hot, I'm sauna
I sweat money, and the bank is my shower
Haha, and that pistol is my towel
Haha, so stop sweating me, coward
And I would die for ours
Ride for hours, supply the flowers
This is history in the making
Now shut the fuck up and let me make it

Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
I swear this tea is at a real good temperature right now
So am I, yeah, yeah

I spit Alcatraz bars, I know
And D-boys is the only Alphabet Boys I know
Got a .380 on my waist and Rambo back home
No more bandana 'round my dome, bandana in my right pocket
Bitch, I'm grown, fuck what you on
Now, watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne
And if I jump, I'ma fly and look into the eagle's eye
And see, I am nothing like you, why?
Bitch, see, it gets me how nothing gets me or get to me
And if you shootin' for the stars, then just shoot me
But your bullets don't reach Mars
Paws, claws, because I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'll get you, my picture should be in the dictionary
Next to the definition of "Definition"
Because repetition is the father of learnin'
And son, I know your barrel burnin', but—

Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
Ayy, I'ma talk to my daddy

Papa, I did it to 'em! I'm a bastard!
And I'ma do it again, like "nigga" backwards
These niggas backwards, but they behind us
Now, watch me get high, like, time's up
Nah, D., bring the drums back
And watch me hit 'em where they lungs at, like that
I get respect 'cause if I don't, I'ma take it
I see your boys hating, and I see your girls naked
Drum, sound like a naked gun, switch clips with my thumb
Then, I pop another clip in and aim at his vision
'Cause Wayne is his vision, 'cause Wayne is the mission
I'm aiming at a mirror

Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
And I've done it before
Please don't make me do it no more
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
Watch me soar
Where the fuck is my guitar? Now roar
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher

Dedication 6
See, normally this where I'd say
"And like that, we gone"
Ahh, ah, this that 6 shit
Ah, Dedication 6
But really, we just halfway
Dedication 6, ah, ahh
This that 6 shit, ah, Dedication 6
This just part one!
Yah, yah-ahh (Gangsta Griz-ills!)

You ain't gotta lie to me
But you might have to lie for me
You might have to trap for me
You know I got mouths to feed
You know they got bitches that'd die to be
The bitch that'll die for me
Strap doves to her body and fly to me
But you get too high to me (Y'all ready?)

And you don't even believe in Yeezus
Why you wearin' Yeezy sneakers?
She ain't never swallowed semen
I don't even believe her speeches
You can't even keep a secret
Why you wear Victoria Secret
You don't even believe in peace
I'm fuckin' you with both my fingers

Baby I'm out your league, bitch
You know there's no more me's, bitch
You need to show more cleavage
V-neck polo tees, bitch
You need to patch your weave, bitch
You need to pack your things, bitch
You on some "I had a dream" shit
It's back to reality, bitch
She don't even roll the weed
All she do is roll her eyes
All she know is social media
We don't even socialize
I feel like North Korea
Even though we oceanside
All I say is "Mama-mia"
She don't even know her moms
All she say is "This your pussy"
She say that to most of the guys
She don't even know it's dry
I can't even open fire
She don't even close her eyes
She don't even close the blinds
She spit all over the D
I'm sticky like porcupines
She don't even compromise
I still make her cum three times
I still make her snort some lines
And make her look so surprised
I still her make her recognize
Make her exercise to a sexier size
Then I tell her how to tell better lies
Now her extra guys think she never lie
We got a better bond, we have a better time
She got a wetter pond
I cum ahead of time, and a second time
And in record time
I'm a New Orleans nigga, I make a second line
I'm a Megatron
I got her legs up like the Omega sign
And I know she rolling 'cause I checked her tires
Then I checked her eyes, she a little rough around the edges, fine
Like Checkers fries
And the X was mine
She requested five
So I gave her two and told her stretch the high
We had sex 'til nine, ate breakfast tired
Fell asleep eye to eye, thigh on thigh
Then she woke up high, like "Oh my God" and tried to rectify
But if you naked, why?
If you mesmerized be mesmerized
If you scared of love, I'm death-defyin'
Got to make your mind, I'ma make the guap
Got to take your time, I'ma take the shot
I'ma wake the block, I'ma break the lock
Then rape your thot, then shake the spot
I'ma shake your hand when I see you out
I'ma shake my head when you turn around
Cops shake they head when they see your house
We shot it up, but look like we burned it down
Hor-Horror scene, bitch
Everyday Halloween, bitch
Kidnap, hide and seek, bitch
I'm a legend like Socrates, bitch
I aim at your collard green, bitch
Bada-boom, bada-bing, bitch
I'm looking for a solid, clean bitch
I tell her "Look, honestly, bitch"

You ain't gotta lie to me
But you might have to lie for me
You might have to trap for me
You know I got mouths to feed
You know they got bitches that'll die to be
The bitch that'd die for me
Stickin' to a nigga like Siamese
And you just on the side of me

And you don't even like Adidas
Why you wearin' Yeezy sneakers?
She ain't never had a threesome
I dont' even believe her speeches
She don't even believe in freedom
But all she giving me is freebies
You don't even believe in peace
I'm fuckin' her with both my fingers

83 ContributorsDemon LyricsAs the title implies, Lil Wayne discusses the many demons in his life – women, money, and even himself. These demons are very demanding and Wayne is attempting to escape them before they ultimately destroy him.
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas, see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
She agree to my demands too
Brought the demon out her ass too
I'm a demon, I demand you

A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon, I demand you
You brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out the man, ooh
The demon out the man, you
Brought the demon out the man, ooh

You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, "Can we dance?"
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands

A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon by demand too
Yeah, brought the demon out the man, ooh
She agree to my demands too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out her ass too

Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently, so now they're startin' to enter it

Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally

But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'

I can't fuck with ho niggas; I can't trust these hoes, neither
Wake up early in the mornin', eat that pussy like cold pizza
Hatin'-ass niggas be baller blockin', actin' like some goalkeepers
There's a reason for everything, but my niggas kill for no reason
Camo shorts with a ho-beater; all-black hoodie, I'm Grim Reaper
Look like it's time for spring cleanin', brand-new spankin' street sweeper
Been in the game, I'm knee-deep, I like good head, I like good reefer
All my niggas strapped and ready to set it off: Queen Latifah
Got a chopper with a drum, split Swishers with my thumb
Get money like Donald Trump, double-barrel on that pump
This kush I got ain't no chump, get stupid and get stomped
Two guns, I call 'em "Kris Kross"; Kris Kross'll make you jump
Gotta do what a nigga gotta do, got goons, I ain't even gotta shoot
Got a bunch of bad bitches by the pool, I like my bitches in twos
Gotta go, I stick it and move, G-code, I stick to the rules
Last night I got so high, I swear to God, I went to the moon
I'm on that shit you can't get nowhere—you pussy, boy, don't go there
If I don't do nothin' I'ma ball: no hair
Smokin' on that "Oh yeah," my niggas tote that hardware
What you 'bout, whoadie? My niggas 'bout that warfare
Real nigga since day one, 'cause I ain't promised day two
Throw that pussy at me, bitch, I think I'm Babe Ruth
Drop top Maybach on the way, yeah, that's that new Landaulet
She let me into her jungle, I'm gonna hit her with that rattlesnake
Guns clap like patty-cake, Blood gang red bandana face
Make them pussies pop they self, you can call that masturbate
I don't front, don't fabricate, I get high, I gravitate
Weezy F. Baby, bitch, the "F" is for "Fascinate"
Louisiana, I'm from that swamp, I'ma pull this bitch out and dump
Better run like Forrest Gump, fuck you and where you from
Three, two, I am the one, job well done
I ball 24/7, 3-6-5, twelve months
What's up, redbone? What's up, caramel?
Come to Wayne's World, it's a fairy tale
Yeah, I'm high, bitch; bitch, I parasail
Carter IV is late, sorry for the wait

Thank you

Cut the music up

YMCMB, bitches call me "Tunechi Li"
I be with niggas that shoot police
I keep that iron, you can get creased
And if she say she didn't fuck—bitch, you're lying through your teeth
They say, "It cost to be the boss"
The ones in jail wish they were free
Niggas call me "Hi-C" because I'm high, as you can see
Niggas say they paid they dues; well, I'm checking your receipt
Might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat
Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch, "Who but me?"
Got your bitch bent over, nigga—hands to her feet
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef
'Cause all my niggas well rounded
Don't fuck with none of these square niggas
Mask on, Ghostface Killah, draw down and erase niggas
I'm a Blood, is you a blood donor? Swisher full of that California
I hit it sideways: caddy-corner
Then she catch that nut like pneumonia—Lil Tunechi!

Lay it down, ho (Haha), lay it down, bitch
Lay it down, ho, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Put the money on the couch, nigga
Give me everything up in your house, nigga, shut your mouth, nigga
Put the money on the couch nigga
Give me everything up in your house, nigga, shut your mouth, nigga (Yeah)

Start it up: vroom, vroom
Uppercut a bitch out the bus: boom, boom
Unless I get the brain: pum-pum
She let a nigga run and get the gang, run a train: zoom-zoom
Tryna get paid too soon, one deep
One sweep away in a room-room
We getting money over here, talking shit and fucking bitches
I don't know what the fuck they doing, Tune
My syrup purple, my turf Earth, my birth circle, I'll dirt surf you
I squirt-murk you, my verse hurtful
My shooters still got curb curfews
Y'all bout as hot as Von Dutch, y'all not gone harm much
Hijack y'all some prom bus; ain't no retreat but my arms up
No graffiti, my bombs up
It's Young Money in this shit until a nigga dead and gone
If you wanna set it off, what you wanna bet it on?
I'm betting the wedding's off when e'erything wetted on
Point 'em out, Truk your life, fuck your style
Fuck with me, you a bucket foul
Niggas'll buck your smile for a dunking pile
You better duck it, pal

Lay it down ho (Yeah), lay it down bitch (And I smoke)
Lay it down ho, lay it down (Lil Tunechi)
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down... (Hahaha, mhm)

Shawty, what's your name? Is you trickin'? Is you paying?
Is you sniffin' on that 'caine? What the fuck, is you saying?
If you getting it, then you getting it
It's my money, I ain't splitting it
I ain't tripping it, if she got a fat ass, then I'm tipping it (Tipping it)
Came out the bank—"Bye, teller!" Give a bum money—"Hi, fella!"
Bad lil' ho, high-yellow, brand new Rolie, Sky Dweller
Just left from Dubai, flew private-eye
I made a million dollars, swear to God, that ain't no lie
I said, them niggas was popping, fake niggas be watching
My black glove be dripping wet, but I got my Cochran
Losing ain't no option, I'm teaching bitches my doctrine
The Maybach ain't poppin, if it ain't got no par-tah-tion
Oops, I mean "partition"; it's all a part of my vision
I sit and count this money while I watch you bitches audition
I said, "Oops, I mean 'partition'; it's all a part of my vision
I sit and count this money while I watch you bitches audition," hehehe

Fuck wrong with you bitches?
I don’t give a fuck
You don’t hear me, you don’t see me—bitch, you gon' feel me, ho
Young Money, Young, Young Money nigga
Young, Young—lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down, aah!

Uh, I thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga, I’m dope, nigga
Change my name, I ain't like average Joe, nigga
Up above wit' my above average ho, nigga
Tight frame with a tight cameltoe, nigga
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
Killas on the inside, and on your blindside
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin’ eyebrows
Ooh, kill 'em—it's that "Carter V," let me get 'em
I'm feeling like John Gotti Lennon
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
You got money on your mind and we aimin' at your temple
Check me out or just be quiet in the library, nigga
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin’ every winter
And as long as I’m alive I'm a financial wizard
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
Thank the Lord I’m not a broke nigga

I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin’, you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs
They say, "You are what you smoke"

I grew up around dope niggas
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggas
I grew up around dope niggas

Yeah, I grew up around dope niggas and cold killers
And most niggas was both, nigga, two sport niggas
I was no different from those niggas, but I was chose, nigga
See those niggas saw more in me than these hoes, nigga
Momma was a go-getter, a coach, nigga
Taught me everything I know, nigga, a soul sister
Taught me how to be a goal tender, support system
For that bitch who played her role with ya and those children
I ain't lyin', slime, all my niggas balling, it's a fuckin' team sport
I could change the world, but I done lost the remote
All my niggas balling, that's how it's supposed to be, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode
Coke sniffers and dope stickers
And most niggas was both, nigga, explode, nigga
Pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga, to those niggas
'Cause life's too fuckin' short, nigga—get old, nigga
I ain't lyin', got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model, while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggas targets, that's includin' me, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people
And definitions 'cause we're defined by our legal roles
All your haters fuelin', and my needle broke
Lord, I ain't a broke nigga

I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga

I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin', you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs
They say, "You are what you smoke"

I grew up around dope niggas
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggas
I grew up around dope niggas
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga

Mama jumped out a plane, I was air-borne (see ya)
Gold watches, gold chains; watch for Leprechauns (what?)
Favorite subject was PE, Pablo Escobar
Kill him when he least expect it, at a restaurant (blaow!)
Throw him with the rest of 'em, in a reservoir (run it)
I'm the renaissance man, peep my repertoire
Excuse my French, but it's menage a trois, au revoir! (ayy!)
Woo, my Nina Ross got a bad mouth (yeah)
Yea, I'm consuming grass like a cash cow (yeah)
Give a fuck 'bout a police with his badge out (fuck 'em!)

Woo, tell them bitches free dick and blow
Give me head, can't kiss no more (nope!)

They  say, "All facts," but don't prove shit (Huh)
You  in my way, need to move, bitch (Huh)
Shut the fuck up, no excuses (Huh)

Money spread on me like Boosie
Real ones ride for me, no cruise ship

I don't really sleep or take naps, no snoozin'
All  these burners here hot, but we coolin'
I was playin' dumb, they was thinkin' I'm stupid
My accountant just called, said, "Shit been movin'"
I'm 'posed to have no gun, I got two of 'em
I never remind a nigga what I do for 'em
I was dead broke, sleep on the futon
Now I'm up, now I'm big house, few of 'em
Everyday I'm lit, my life like a re-run
If I take your shit, can't give you no refund
Ten mil' for a deal I agree on
I put on for Atlanta like Deion
Chrome Heart glasses, I can't see 'em
From the apartments to an arena
Where that lil' boy been? I ain't seen him
Look at God's child drivin' the Demon
Fuck what you heard

I'm gonna sip, got that purple pollution (Yeah)
I get the checks and just do it no swooshes (Yeah)
Flex on my ex then I flex on my new bitch (Yeah)
No disrespect, I bust down the noose (Yeah)
Put it on my neck, now my neck is a nuisance (Yeah)
I am a mess, I am a mutant (Yeah)
Bullets go through your vest like it's translucent
I smoke the best exclusive
I'm somewhere else secluded (Secluded)
Fly to death, and your bitch just flew in
You a ref, my nigga, you blew it (You blew it)
I don't sketch, but the pistol, I drew it
Told myself to continue my duties
I got money from 2002, that I ain't seen since 2002
Me, Sean, and Brazy, my nigga, we boolin'
Ballin' so brazy, I dribble and shoot it
Just like I play for Emilio Pucci
I treat the Wraith like that bitch is Suzuki
I need a favorite woman like The Fugees
It's me, Sean, and Baby, we lit as Three Stooges
My skate stance is goofy, my bae ass is stupid
No fake asses truly, I'm makin' her moon me

If you in my way, then I gotta go through you

[Song 121: No Type]
54 ContributorsNo Type LyricsThis is Lil Wayne’s remix of the 2014 hit song by Rae Sremmurd, “No Type”.
'Cause I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
Counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite
Yeah, my bitch got a wife
Yeah, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line
They pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied

Yeah, bad bitch on my team, mmm
Bad bitch on my team, just like Katniss Everdeen
Got lipstick everywhere
I got her shaking on this dick-dick-dick-dick-dick-dick like a electric chair, lawd
I got liquor, I got cigarettes
And these pussy ass niggas just got PMS
I don't think you should see him, nor live off per diem
She just took off her clothes and said you ain't lyin'
She pretty like the bride of Frankenstein
She kill it like she married to the mob
I can't let one of these hoes lock me down mama
She said don't worry son I'll help you make bond
'Cause these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
Diamonds in my teeth, I'm eating carrot cake
So hard for me to put on a fake smile
I had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
I got cocaine, I got cigarettes
I don't do neither, it's at my bitch request
She like bad boys, I'm her crook in the neck
Her suicide note say she love me to death
Ooh, for her Lewinsky is so critical
And I didn't mean to get political
I watch her, let her figure slither
But I don't look into her snake eyes

I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line
They pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet, fat as fuck, with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy but they don't get out of line
I'm sorry for the wait til I drop that Carter 5

'Cause these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9

[Song 122: Kobe Bryant]

I’ve been a Lakers fans since Kobe Bryant came into the league straight from high school. Back when he did it, it was… Read More 
I want to be the best
I want to be the best, simple and plain
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
And that's what drives me

He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo' mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassin's mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant
There is no one
This guy is highly motivated
What separates Kobe from the pack
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one

Kobe doin' work, 2-4 on my shirt
He the greatest on the court, and I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the fourth ring like it was his first
Gotta get the gleam, do it for Kareem
Two-four so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldstein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings
Kobe in the game, dunkin' on the whole
Black Mamba, attack, conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, or turnaround jumper
Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's goin', it's goin' down, yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown, though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show

I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing

Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry 'bout my shot
Cause I'ma get that off
Yea, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work 'em like a auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
Cause I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with three seconds
And I bet we gon' win it all in three seconds
Ya dig
That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team
Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let 'em get to me
Literally
Step back and give 'em a three
Ain't no defending me

One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately, LeBron James
I've been quoted saying that
He's definitely the best player in our league
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our league
And there's not another guy in our league
That can accomplish some of the things
That he's doing

Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
And get a J off
Baseline face time
Tongue out like two-three
Even two-three gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
Tha brackets ain't for me
I will be jumpin' over you
Like I got a mattress at my feet
And all is Phil Jackson say is you
Better be passin' it to me
I put the master in the piece
Attack you like a beast
And I am starvin' for victory
And that means I'mma eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me

Seckbach: Who's the best player in the NBA
Mikael: Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant
Seckback: Really? Why
Mikael: Because you never know what you're gonna get!

Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. Automatic
I can post 'em up, or Lamar go get the alley
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want
They want Kobe
And what he want
He want the trophy
The victory
And the glory
No Shaq
No Robert Horry
Now break 'em off, Kobe break 'em off, yeah
You better be where that Laker don't, yeah
Just give him the ball and he take it off, yeah
Or he properly dishing it to Gasol, yeah
Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah
Cause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah
Uh, do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothin' wrong with doin' it four times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year
Now what's defense
To an assassin
Killer instinct
Murder the basket
Then steal the ball back
Hold it for ransom
It's more than a game
This is a passion
Been a all-star, been a champion
Free throw line, you hear 'em chanting
MVP, MVP
Kobe Bryant aka MV-me
In knee deep, smash any D
Whoever he is he can't guard me
He can't guard me

"So, there you have it. The overwhelming answer was ... Kobe Bryant"

[Song 123: Levels]
69 ContributorsLevels LyricsLil Wayne goes in on Meek Mill’s song “Levels.”
Man, all you pussy niggas drive me crazy
Make me sick to my stomach, I feel nauseated
All you haters hold hands and jump off a building
I could still taste her pussy; memorabilia
Backpack full of artillery
One me, no equivalent
These niggas acting like lil' bitches
I don't understand this shit like you scribbled it
Took her clothes off, step back and exhibit it
Then tear her ass up like a parking ticket
The end of the road is at walking distance
Have to get that blood off my hands, left the faucet drippin'
In yo' face like a airbag in a car collision
My weed, man, so consistent
I'm stayin' rich, tryin' not to make poor decisions
Everything I do, I plan it out like a solar system
Nigga, if you clumsy you gon' slip and fall a victim to me
Your bitch is sendin' naked pictures to me
Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in a bed
I shoot off in her mouth then she bit the bullet, uh
Skatin' on 'em like I'm Lil Wayne
And the weed so strong, I can feel veins
Write it down, take a picture, now I feel framed
The drugs got me so numb, I can't feel ashamed
And my girl at home with the mood swings
Girl, I gotta make a few runs like Usain
Wish I had a penny for my thoughts for some loose change
Hungry niggas going at yo' neck for that food chain
Pop some pills that make me sleepy
Hoes creep me in they Teepee
I hope that pussy taste like kiwi
Hope it's nicer than Tahiti, hopin' I could get a freebie
Leavin' a nigga body floatin' with a mouth full of seaweed
What's in my Louis backpack, that's E.T
Snitches give me the heebeegeebees
I hope they'll disappear, where the fuck is Houdini?
I got niggas on my side, you got niggas on yo' back
I'ma yell timber, money grow on trees
Money over queens, fuck you, blow me
I sit back enjoy the breeze, hoes prettier than please
I don't really do shit but sit back and call the shots
She poured out her heart, I had it on the rocks
Red beam on yo' head, that's a cherry on top
You don't wanna keep your cool, I know niggas that'll die, uh
I danced with the devil in my dreams
When I wake up, I still hear the same song
Make me wanna blow a motherfucker brains out
Flood warning nigga, I'm about to brainstorm, lil nigga
I'll take yo' main ho, make her call her homegirl
Make 'em share the same dick
It's that motherfuckin' Dedication 5
I just hope I'll be alive to see a Dedication 6
Lil Tunechi

Ayo, it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Been doing MIA since Levels was the shit
And niggas know I'm on another level with this shit
I'm pedaling the 6, full metal when it hit
All I need is a shovel and a ditch
You done dig me a hole then you show me where it is
Run in his home and show me where the kids
Put one in his dome while he going in his fridge
That's me, him nigga
Black piece AP, gold trim, nigga
Black jeans, grey tee, old Tim's, nigga
Backstreet, everything go for 10, nigga
Keep quiet, beef, we deep fry it
I'm in the streets like Rodney King's riots
Mommy opposed their lead tight
On that old bullshit; Pete Myers
They scream and seize fire
My audible like Godfather meets Wire
A felon in the whip
Rollin 3 6's, devil on trips
Shots whistled like a kettle when it's lit
I'm tryin' to go ballistic, shadow in the ship
Call the Barney Rubble in the whip
Made her kick rocks, blow haze from ziplocks, uh

One hand on my money, one hand on my buddy
That's the AK-47, make his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds, you can hear them bitches humming
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach
Niggas know I'm sick: I don't spit, I vomit—got it?
One egg short of the omelet
Simon says: "Shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg
And tell him, 'Catch up,' like mayonnaise"; um—
I'm the sickest nigga doing it—bet that, baby
These other niggas dope; I'm wet crack, baby, yes!

I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it come to that paper, I stack books ha
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet or put some money on ya head
Life ain't cheap, you better off dead if you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga Fee
See, every motherfucker at the door don't get a key
You're outside looking in, so tell me what you see
It's about money, it's bigger than me
I told my homies, "Don't kill him, bring the nigga to me" (Gangsta!)
Yeah, don't miss, you fucking with the hitman
Kidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again

Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for you

You try me, get bodied, keep Nina and shotty in the whip
If a nigga try to stick me, I'ma blam him
Sing along now—"Di-di-dadi," I'm Free, got the burners
Got the green, he got the tan, got the whole enchilada
Owe me dough, I'm inside of your house, tie up your brother (Woo)
Make the prick call up your mother (Ugh), she might know where to find you, I am—
On top of my job, the heavyweight champ with the flow
It's flow like the ocean, open water, you're drowning, I will (Damn)
Four-pound him and seek him, heat him, then leave him stinking (Yuh)

Take control of your soldiers, you won't miss 'em
'Til I toss em in the wok like chicken, General Tso, uh-oh!

I make it hard for rap niggas, I'm peer pressure (Yes)
Matter of fact I'm motivation to rap better (Yes)
I show niggas how to act, how to dress better
I stay fresh, more fitted caps than bad catchers (Woo)
I'm the crack, the smack, the gun, the rule
The gat, the strap, the gun, the tool
The motherfucking (Cannon!)
Other words, I'm the real, for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill
The deal is sealed (Yes)
Niggas ain't real as Will, 'cause I'm a (Cannon!)
And I handle well, pedal like Cannondale
And I got the 50-cal' mag, its a handheld (Cannon!)
I'm telling you niggas, I pop, put a shell in you niggas (Oh)
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas (Oh, oh)
I got whores in the Canon camcorder bendin' over
Blowing 'ghan by the quarter, weed odor in the Rover, nigga

Yeah (Cannon!)
Detroit Red getting change like them white folks (Ha)
Dump it out the window of the Range with the rifle (Ha)
Pain like a bitch like the first day of a cycle (Ha)
You better scurry when I pull the (Cannon! Ha)
Tracks burn the streets like a truck do the gas
I love head and caressing a voluptuous ass (What else?)
I ask ya baby mama is she up to the task
She like "Damn Red, it's bigger than a (Cannon!)"
My attire makes the ladies say, "Your man is too fly" (What else?)
Imported oils from Iran and Dubai (What else?)
Get caught slipping with your mans, and you die
Where I'm from, niggas be quick to squeeze the (Cannon! Ha)
Detroit Red always got some shit for your ears
Show me love, but keep it moving, man, 'cause if you get near (Ha)
I'll say, "Get off my dick" and tell your bitch to come here
'Cause you sweating me and my DJ, Don (Cannon!)

Legs spread far out, you know how I'm standing
Yeah, I'm posted with the big homie (Cannon! Ha)
I got niggas who don't like rap loving our shit
We got niggas who was stuck on Pac bumping our shit
These niggas can't see me like I ain't been around lately
A good batter; when they at the mound, it's gravy
Niggas salty, I'm pepper, no Spinderella
Just a cigarillo filled with Tropicana
Yeah, Vic found that lick; now, we ain't smoking no more regular
Keep your mid-grade, I don't think you know no better
They loved "In Da Trunk"; now, they wanna hear more shit
I play it modest, like, "Nigga, that's some of our old shit"
Got niggas I ain't never met wanting to fight me
Got hoes that's in love, asking, "Why you don't like me?"
Bitch, I'm married to the game, and I love my wifey
Stepping over competition, man, I love these Nikes (Yeah)
I'm hot, they fanning
Niggas try to copy my style like the (Cannon! Ha)
Don't try to compare—I'm in a league of my own
If I ain't listed at the top, nigga, the stats is wrong
All the data is off, your info ain't valid
Artist of the century, the competition ain't balanced
True, like Master P and his two brothers
Don't call it incest, but Juice the motherfucker, like— geah!

This what I'ma do!
From here on out, you can call me Mr. Game Seven!
Oh, yeah!
That was just preseason!
You thought we was playing for real?

[Song 125: Grove St. Party]
97 ContributorsGrove St. Party Lyrics
Woo!
Hahahaha

I got a whole lotta money, pop that pussy for me
My homie got that yopper, he a-bang it at a copper
Ayy, gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Stove on my waist, cook your ass up, gourmet
All-black four-four, do you want foreplay?
I'm going at your face like Oil of Olay
No champagne, but you know my flag rosé
Swagger on steroids: Canseco, Jose
No Limit Records: We so 'bout it 'bout it
I'm higher than a bitch, feel like I climbed a fucking mountain
Illest nigga you know, my accountant still counting
Shot hit him a minute ago, but his body still bouncing
Beam on the hammer, beam on your forehead
Gotta kill the witnesses 'cause Birdman car red
Hollygrove Monster, Eagle Street creature
Come to your funeral, kill everybody but the preacher
I live in Miami, nigga, I'll South Beach you
Robin Leach—uh, that's how we ballin'
You know that I'm loaded, but please don't think it's sweeter
Beat one of you bitch niggas up like John Cena
Them hoes on Young Money, tell them hoes we coming
Boy, we get it popping, we ain't saving hoes, we swapping
Yeah, gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Big-head Desert Eagle, call it Sade
I just get that money, Stunna taught me that
That Xan took me under, Patrón brought me back
I'm leaning on these motherfuckers like I caught a flat
And that Glock snap back like an old Starter hat, haha!
What the lick read? I'm in the big league
I'm a breath of fresh air—let the bitch breathe
I'm tryna chillax, but I had to do it, Dev
I'm at the funeral, like, "I had to do it, Rev.!"
Mack, you my big brother, I'll split a wig for you
Put that on Mary P., until they bury me
Moment of clarity—yeah, that's my diamond game
I keep a fine bitch 'cause I like the finer things
Haha! Fuck with me, slime
No brain on the whip, I got nothing in mind, hehe
Carter 4, they ain't fucking with mine
I drop that Sorry 4 the Wait to make up for the time, yeah!

Yeah I do my thang, bitch what's up? (Swag)
Young BasedGod, came in with the ballers (Woo, woo, woo, with the ballers)
Iced-out chain, bitch, I'm rich off that same shit (Oh, that same shit)
Sixty-five hoes on my dick, bitch, it's Christmas
Straight Westside, Bay Area bitch, I'll grave em (Swag)
Pretty boy shit, Based God finna hang 'em
Armed like a cradle, and you niggas can't stop me (Can't stop me)

Young BasedGod with that 55 heater

Gangster, gangster
(DatPiff dot com, world premiere) Okay
Yeah
I'm reloaded (gangster grizzils)
Trill outchea
So after D6, I text Weezy
It's rough
I say, now it's time for a vacation
Guess the iPhone autocorrected
And he thought I said "now it's time for a Dedication."
Now you want it? 'Cause we gon' bring it y'all
So now y'all got a twenty pack
What's your address?
You're welcome
And not your email address neither
D6: Reloaded
Front door, leggo
A Dedication!

Looking in the mirror, all I see is money
Bop-bop, but if I was blind, all I hear is runnin'
Plug went to jail Saturday, 'posed to meet him Sunday
He said his bitch flushed the work, time to do some plumbin'
Gotta love the way we comin' though, we keep it comin'
Wolves never cry wolf and you could feed us onions
Pledge allegiance to the region that's beneath and under
The southside from your blind side, Stevie Wonder
Hunger Games, ain't no games when we speakin' hunger
We greedy fuckers, eat your supper, pick our teeth, and mug you
The pockets bustin' out the muscle, bitch, I'm bleedin' blubber
And I been drunk and I can't trust you 'cause I'm seein' double
And I been ballin' like the Rucker, nigga, triple-double
And now it's war, and they want peace, but it won't fix the puzzle
You drop the ball, if you a beast you won't be quick to fumble
If I'm too deep then get a bigger shovel, dig a tunnel
If you a beast then that bitch can't get a nickel from you
I'm the only one that speak when we in the huddle
Make a pussy nigga leak, then jump in the puddle
We comin' deep to your street, 'bout to rent a shuttle
Every day of the week, if I hit the streets, I gotta hit a hustle
Every day of the week I gotta get loaded—Lordy, skip the bufferin'!
I got it made, and with that said, I gotta tip the butler
I like my bitches mustard, business hushed, and Bentleys custom
Bitches sufferin' 'cause the system fucked 'em, now they fuckin'
They can't hide their battle scars but they can hide their stomachs
Niggas like Niagara Falls how their mouths are runnin'
But we making caviar out of flounders, guppies
Stand tall, but I'm a munchkin to my pile of money
Got down and dug it, found a nugget, made a mountain of it
Don't need a crown, gown, or nothing; I'm the king of subject
Chocolate, brown, cream, and fudgie, and I'm peanut buttery
Fuck the fuckery, I go skullduggery, it get ugly
Niggas thuggin', we got babies smugglin' in their Huggies
Niggas jugglin' different kind of drugs, Feds strugglin'
Sippin' Actavis, activist like Fred Douglass
Goodnight, sleep tight, watch the bed buggies
She give me ass, she give me head, I call it head-buttin'
Walk in a room full of buttons, press the red button
Blow this bitch to shreds, get my skateboard and shred somethin'
Lead pumpin', you dead, pumpkin
Go 'head, dump 'em, redrum 'em
Goin' hard in the paint, Andre Drummond
Headhuntin', Good Will Huntin', still stuntin'
All or nothin', Warren G to Warren Buffett
Stormin', floodin', lightnin', thunderin'
Carter comin', like karma comin'
My bitch pussy's the warmest oven
Need morning lovin'
She foreign, Donald might bomb her country
Thick as fuck, no panties when she got on her onesie
Whoa
Time to get this paper though
You ape or ho?
Bitches in line to get this snake fo' sho'
We take the dough if they don't pay the dough
And that's fo' sho'
We make 'em vegetables, and we don't even like vegetables
These niggas extra broke, we break a nigga down to decimals
We up in México to see the plug, and not electrical
High cholesterol, you niggas salty, I'm the pepper though
Your bitch ain't half a ho, she wanna be in my next episode
I'm a steppin' stone
And that .380, that's my chaperone
It blow like saxophone
And when the smoke clear I'ma stand alone
I'm from the terrordome
Yeah, that's New Orleans, home of methadone
Cops on megaphones
It's so much bad luck, ain't no leprechauns
I been called a stone, pocket full of stones
On the corner moving stones, Papa was a rolling stone
I'm so stoned, in this bitch, waitin' on Babylon
Bible on the dresser, next to the gun and Tylenol, silence off
Spike a bitch drink, like volleyball
Olive Oyl skinny bitches can't get in the ride at all
Not at all
I'm involved in a real private war, time to brawl
Niggas don't want Lil Tune to take these diamonds off
I'ma talk crazy to a deaf nigga, these niggas blind
I'ma still throw up my set, nigga, steel toe in your chest, nigga
"Hell no" to a yes-nigga, "Fuckin' right" to a bad bitch
She can fuck around and get her ass licked
Still can't get her ass kissed
Black fist, middle finger to taxes, the police and their actions
I'm still pickin' out mansions
Still dickin' down such-and-such, still fuckin' with so-and-so
Still fuckin' my bitch's friends, never fuck my woadie ho
Still talkin' about Hollygrove, still talkin' about coke and dope
On the set in that OVO, on the jet in that OVO
I don't threaten, I go for broke, wanna step and go toe to toe?
No bullshit at this rodeo, and all my clips Pinocchio
Tunechi, bitch, for nothing, drops mic

Well, I can't technically 'cause it's connected
But, but, you get the expression, Mula
Welcome, thank you for joining
Dedication 6, this some sick shit
Umm, first of all, I wanna thank Drama for doing this shit again, and always doing this shit for his dawg. My nigga, one time. Thank everybody involved, everybody involved. My team, my team is my fam. Everybody who put they fingerprints on this shit, 'preciate everybody
So the definition of Dedication has changed for me since the first one, since the second one, since the third one, whatever. It's because, umm, whenever I put it out, umm, it's life. And since I don't write none of my shit, I'm coming from the head. And what happens is, when you rap so long or when you do it so long, all the things in your head, you done used up. So what happens is you gotta start using something else and coming from somewhere else, and that somewhere else is ten times out of ten your heart. And, umm, that's what this Dedication 6 project is
But, uh, yeah, the definition is always different because I'm always going through something at that time of my life, you know what I mean. I prolly was fucking your bitch on Dedication 4, and the whole fucking shit was dedicated to her, you know what I mean. I dunno. Whichever one that wasn't, that didn't do as well as all of the rest of them, that was definitely the one that was dedicated to her

[Song 127: Trap House]
75 ContributorsTrap House LyricsFor the third track off of Sorry For The Wait 2, Wayne hops on the instrumental from the Rich The Kid track, “Jumping Like Jordan”.
Ooh! Yeah
Lil Tunechi got it jumpin' like Jordan
These pussy ass niggas can't guard me
These rookie ass niggas still crawlin'
These lookin' ass niggas eyeballin'
These hookin' ass bitches eyeballin'
But I got a bad bitch at home cooking dinner
Hi honey, I'm home, I'm starvin'
These crooked ass cops still winnin'
Black man family still mournin'
Black President ain't do nothin'
We need a real nigga up in that office
Got the White House jumpin' like Jordan
Got the crack house jumpin' like Jordan
I want my new house bigger than Jordan's
With a backyard bigger than a forest
Like "ooh" bedroom jumpin' like Jordan
Hoes at the door and they arguin'
This dick a superstar, they want stardom
My life like Bailey and Barnum's
These bitches ain't got no manners
These niggas ain't got no standards
My bitch ain't got no love handles
Boy, I'm clippin' that toe on that camel
I got bitches that'll kill for me – Charles Manson
Suck this thuggish ruggish bone, swallow that bone marrow
Ooh, chopper sittin' on my lap like the mall Santa
Nigga, shoot you all in your gall bladder
Your pallbearers need pallbearers
I'm mixing weed like gumbo
I knock your head off – Fumble
Homeboys be cutthroat
That shit got me with a lump throat
But Tunechi bigger than Elvis Presley
Young Money was my best investment
Going harder than my predecessor
I don't break records, I sets the records
Lil Tunechi coming back like Kobe
Niggas stab me in the back, I owe 'em
Got a house in the hills
Now a nigga gotta deal
With mountain lions and coyotes
Semi, I keep that semi
And friendly, I can't be friendly
Freckles, them bullet holes look like freckles
You look like Wendy's
House in the hills jumpin' like Jordan
I can't swim but I'm throwing pool parties
I got a bitch over there, and a bitch over there
A young nigga starting to feel cornered
My LA house jumpin' like Jordan
My Miami house jumpin' like Jordan
Can't forget about my house in New Orleans
So sorry for the wait, I'm sorry
I want my new bitch titties enormous
With a backyard and a pretty garden
With a pussy more pink than a orchid
Young nigga gonna treat it like a florist
I got my side bitch feeling important
I got my main bitch feeling immortal
I got my ex bitch feeling insulted
Cause wifey get money like Kimora
I got a fine bitch feeling exhausted
Cause I'mma put this dick on her 'til tomorrow
I'mma pull up on a bitch in a Gallardo
Then I'mma take the top off like a barber
I go down and kiss her Pearl Harbor
She's so down with this New World Order
Fuck the shit out her in a sauna
Sweat her hair out, she look like Al Sharpton
Got a goon named Fernando
At the front door your condo
Knock-knock, who's there?
He don't care, he's psycho
Bad bitch with a nice throat
She ice cold and she like hoes
Ooh, she just my type
These other hoes just typos
Young nigga coming back like Jordan
So sorry for the wait, I'm sorry
Yeah, a nigga had to go back to the stash
But a nigga 'stache like James Harden
Young nigga drank lean like water
Young nigga smoke weed like Marley
Young nigga on the Moon like Warren
Young nigga on this shit like Charmin
Ooh, my bitch got a rack, Dolly Parton
Fuck her all night long to some Marvin
Fall asleep in the pussy, good lordy
Woke up in a new Bugatti, good mornin'
Young nigga got guns, good luck
Nina Ross say "Me so horny"
Lil Tunechi, at the top it's so lonely
Got fat pockets, never bony
I'm with a model bitch, she so bony
I done shook shit up, it's so foamy
I just cooked this up, it's still hot
You could still smell the kitchen on me
Nigga I'll have your homies
Singing "Damn I miss my homie"
I got a mountain of weed
I got a mountain of cash
I got mountains like Wyoming
I got a bad bitch and she foreign
She always mad with me, I'm sorry
She say "Damn why you can’t call me?"
"Cause they be taxin' for that roaming"
She a tan bitch, she orange
I can’t stand a snitchin' informant
Niggas cooked crack on a Foreman
While y'all boys was still sparrin', uhh
This that Sorry For The Wait 2
Tell the dead homies you pray to
You on your way too
That the truth is hard to swallow
You got fake juice
Even Slick Rick the ruler know I break rules, ooh
Got the gas out shootin' like Jordan
I'll put your homeboy face on a T-shirt
And put your own face on a milk carton
Busy, I’ve been so busy
Ain’t even got time for quickies
That’s why my bitch been so bitchy
I’m out here tryin' to get me
I’m coming back out jumpin' like Jordan
I’m so sorry for the wait, I’m tardy
I wrote a letter to my competition
It started off with: Dearly Departed
Hippie, I be so trippy
Give her pussy a hicky
I hope she ain’t strictly dickly
So we can menage to Nicki, ooh

Ahem
I'd like for you to take this time
And remember where you was
The first time you heard Dedication
If I asked you how many times you've listened to D2
Could you tell me?
Dedication 3 was the first mixtape you heard when we had a Black president
D4 and 5, we got back to business
Y'all done copied the rhymes
Y'all done stole the artwork
Tried to emulate my shit-talkin'
Weezy and Dram' — we are the Mixtape Blueprint
Hahaha! You welcome
A Dedication

I got Doja, Narcotics, and Actavis; that's DNA
Got a Dyke-ho, Nympho, And your bitch layin' next to me and bae
Eazy like NWA, they make me feel A-OK
Feeling like Tony, "Grr-rr-reat!"; feeling all on me, TSA
She got Dollars, Nut, and Alcohol all over her T&A
She snort all this KKK, and this broad need AAA
Let's enjoy some NBA, y'all lil boys NCAA
Yeah we got A-M-M-O, but you'll get beat like MMA
I got Dracos, Ninos, Automatics; that's my DNA
You'll get beat like Sugar Ray, TKO, O-H-H
I smoke O's, I sip Ace, I pop whole Xanies straight
I got P's, I got weight, I got ki's, I got gates
I got moonrock, molly, ecstasy, inside this weed, it's laced
I smoke doobies, don't smoke J's
Don't watch movies, don't go to plays
I watch cuties, porn, and play
I got Uzis on the way
I don't be choosey, I don't be safe
I don't get woozy, I get the waist
My bitch ballin' like Zhané, Erykah Badu with the fade
Capital-WNBA, I just teach her how to save
I been sleepin' with my AK, with my finger around her waist
I been dreamin' I caught a body —
That's some sweet dreams, who want a taste?
Give the American dream to a bitch that ain't even from the USA
That's the land of the Free, it's the home of AJ
Got a whole brick of some yay, I put one line on the plate
She's gon' take it to the face, like "thin line between love and hate"
I got Dealers 'N' Associates, call that my DNA
All these diamonds, all this gold and shit, call that PB&J
I got Bloods in LA, I got Bloods down in the A
I got Bloods everywhere you lay but ain't no blood in my filet
Hit the court, shoot the DA, treat beef like USDA
OMW to your trap, (Blap!), now I'll be On My Way
I got plugs I ain't got to pay, I got shit I ain't got to say
I got cribs way out of state, I ain't got no more pocket space
Sippin' slo-mo at my pace, lean like I wear a brace
Queens want to be embraced, Kings want to be an Ace
I remember Ace of Spades, I remember the Goose is Grey
Now it's Bumbu by the case, nigga, fuck you, fly away
Six shit, (blrrrp)

Dedicated
To the culture that Tunechi birthed
To the sons and daughters of Weezy
Y'all niggas still watching a master at work
I already got...
D6

I already got the Ganja
I already got the Fanta
All black like Uganda
Hair back like E. Honda, wait
Hardhat like a condom
Your skull crack, then we crowned you
Shark bite to a flounder
Bar fight to a bouncer, wait
All Franks like Sinatra
Face been painted, they ain't never clowned him
Everybody rakin' cash like it's autumn
Y'all boys sweeter than Whatchamacallit
All y'all take a seat on this toilet
Y'all ain't shit, but y'all piss-poor, and
Sittin' in the foreign like I'm on a Harley
Keep bloodsuckers away with the garlic
Alone in a mansion, I'm Macaulay Culkin
Thought about your coffin and started barfin'
Thought about your orphans, how they probably starvin'
Thought about this artful shit, how I'm so thoughtful
Walkin' on the marble, feelin' like Ricardo
Walkin' 'round like the campus of Harvard
Shoutout my nigga Swizz, niggas gettin' smarter
Try to hit the books, and nigga hit the target
Sittin' on the charter, talkin' 'bout the targets
Waitin' on departure, waitin' on a sculpture
Make sure my vultures keep an extra cartridge
And make sure my Barbies keep an extra Barbie
My dick is her electric chair, feel the voltage
And her pussy better smell like a orchid
Wetter than a wishin' well, need a quarter
Damn, I wish I was a lil bit taller
Damn, I wish I drank a lil more water
Damn, my weed stank a lil more harder
Damn, I pull up with a redbone, scarlet
With a yellowbone car
Smoke green, that's Marley
Purple and the orange, you seen, that's horror
No Eve in my garden, F-R-uh, F-R-uh
All the Gs in my corner, them boys so warriors
Believe we deserve every leaf in the forest
Ki's and quarters layin' around my headquarters
Borderline hoarder, you a mortal, I report her
World on my shoulders but it's lighter than a clover
I'm your bitch, baby, hold me tighter than a stroller
System so solar, got white like Crayola
Nut like granola all in your bitch rollers
You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
This is that six shit, the sickness is showin'
The sickness is spreadin', the disease is growin'
The bitches is hoein', the witnesses knowin'
The dollars are torn, they're fishin' for coins
I continue goin', I get to the boar and
I rip off his horns, six in the mornin'
Then I just yawn and forget to mourn and
Give to the star, it's 6, the reward

If lovin' me is wrong, I don’t wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time I thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I’m never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix

Off button, pause button, stop button, lock button
Belly button, big ol' titties, she pop buttons, head buttin'
Versace button down unbuttoned to the top button
Percocets, that's my buttons, hit the pop button
Psychopath, blunt big, big as Mama June off the diet plan
Smokin' science lab
I should have a tattoo that say, "I am nothin' like my dad"
Jesus Christ, amen
My hand in the psychic's hand, she see righteous plans
I see business plans then I lose my mind and my attention span
She see empty hands like, "Oooh, Lordy," smellin' like Cool Water
Just got them new Cartier, the Rollie was too salty
That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My little bitch body a trophy
Naked pics, five in the morning, sunglasses, smilin’ emoji
Pull up on the opps, surprise party
Better get up and stand up like Bob Marley
That is your homie, he died for ya
Check your home screen, that's God callin’ (Hello?)
We makin' an impact, my nigga
We not just black, nigga, we rich and black, nigga
And all them bitches they been after niggas
They run away then they come limpin' back, nigga
Amen, feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse to get on my flyin' horses?
That’s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My lil' bitch body'll solve it
And when you say, "Timber," please, will you whisper?
My nigga, I'm quietly fallin', shhhhh

If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, every time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

Hello? Hello? Rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
I got rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time I thought I was wrong, I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home every time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

Rest in peace, I rest in peace and harmony
I don't talk, I speak, after I pray, I preach
I don't play, I cheat, after I stay, I leave
The fork in the road, grab the fork and eat
Turn that piggy bank to some hog head cheese
But you doin' nothing, well they say, "Nothin' ain't never worth nothin', but it's always free"
Psychopath
Blunt thick, thick as Mama June off the diet plan, smokin' science lab
I should have tattoo that say, "I'm nothin' like your man"
Jesus Christ, Amen!
My hand in the psychic' hand
She see righteous plans, I see power plans
She take my hands put 'em in her pants
Do the hyphy dance then I wipe my hands
Feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse to get on my flyin' horses?
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

You got penny pinch nigga problems, lil whoadie
On the bench nigga problems, lil whoadie
I got a bitch nigga problem, lil whoadie
More bitches more problems, lil whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
What is this nigga problem, lil whoadie?
I got rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Yea

If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix

61 ContributorsU Guessed It LyricsThe instrumental is from U Guessed It by OG Maco. Produced by Brandon Thomas.
Yeah
My lil brother Capo in this bitch with me
He's on that moonrock
Shit be gettin' all in your mouth – pause
Nigga!
I'm sorry for the fucking wait
Was busy
Racing Ferraris with lil Reginae
That's gangsta
You know I always come in second place
You hatin'
It's written all over your fuckin' –

Bitch, you jealous
Woo
And I was right, yeah, haha
Bitch, you jealous
Stuntin' on niggas
Stunt, stunt – The shit niggas don't like
Tell a fuck nigga – "Bitch, you jealous"
I'm Sorry 4 The Wait, apologetic
Bitch you jealous
Now give us our cash and our credit

Pop! Hah
Sorry for the –

Riding 'round like Pablo
Still talking that blanco
My Nina sing soprano
So we gon' leave on a high note
Come out my shell like Rafael
And crack yours like a taco
Lil Wayne tougher than John Wayne
Make him change his name to John Doe
It's me and my lil brother Capo
Lil Marly G and my bottom bitch
If I'm falling, it's bottomless
If I'm tripping, it's a power trip
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates
And with that said, I climb the fence
My other bitches gotta ride the bench
And with that said... bitch you jealous
I'm fly like my dreadlocks propellers
I think I should headline Coachella
My woman a Queen like Coretta
And nigga you sleep with the Devil
I couldn't be Junior forever
I don't mean to ruffle your feathers
But I had to spread my wings
Ain't trying to get lemon-peppered
Got too many pistols, too many issues
Too many mistakes, too many miscues
Only made me better, it turned me into
The man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue
Suit yourself because this suit is a rental
Now the snow is just coming in
Like I broke a window to an igloo
Slow a bitch down like "Un momento"
I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie
If she ain't fucking it's Uber time
I'd rather be advised than supervised
You do the math, we do the numbers
We pour champagne and expensive wine
In water guns and shoot each other
I get high, meditate like a monk
Preposterous when I get drunk
And my goons is wilder than Gronk
My do's is as bad as my don'ts
Met a kinda-cute bitch with a donk
As long as the bitch got a donk
And I smell like; pussy, money, and weed
She say "Ooh, I like your cologne"
The last niggas tested us flunk
So please study hard, study long
Kill your wife, then take the bitch phone
And text you to please hurry home
And the rain drops turn into blood
Look like you just come in from a storm
And if all pussies come with walls
I hope you run into your own
Nigga
I come with that heroin flow
I come with that never before
My CMB days are dead
I ain't worried 'bout ghost
I married the MOB, we divorced
Hoo, and all that shit dead without me of course
It's nothing; a zombie, a corpse
You burnt yourself and was supposed to pass me the torch
Fuck it, I'll see you in Forbes, nigga
I'm sorry for the fucking wait
Was busy, searching my calendar for better days
I found 'em, you either turn the page or tear the page
Y. M., Young Money; never age

Bitch, you jealous, woo
And I was right, yeah
Tell a fuck nigga "Bitch, you jealous"
Stuntin' on niggas
Stunt, stunt; the shit niggas don't like, yeah
Bitch you jealous
I'm sorry for the wait, apologetic, hey
Bitch you jealous
Now give us our cash and our credit, hey

Pop!

[Song 131: Dreams And Nightmares]
84 ContributorsDreams And Nightmares LyricsSampling Meek Mill’s song of the same name, this song is about how everyone Wayne knows – including himself – has changed because of the money.
Turn the music down in my headphones, yeah
That noise in the background, that's my skateboard
That nigga Mack crazy
Yeah, uh

I put my shooters on they feet
I just give 'em your address, then go to sleep
The money turned my niggas into monsters
The white done turned my niggas into Nazis, Lord
The money turned my face into a stocking
Don't make me turn your baby to a hostage, boy
Don't make me turn the kid to a foster
My woman turn my dick into a Mazda, Lord
Body parts in the duffel
The bullets turn your body to a puzzle
The money turn my bitch into a monster
She know how to get a check and turn a zero to a comma, Lord
The money turn my niggas into killas
The sugar turnt the cocaine to vanilla
The money turnt the bitches into hoes
The money turned my niggas into foes, Lord
I put my shooters on they feet
Give 'em your address, then I go out to eat
Had that snowman in the hood like Jody Breeze
She from the hood but look like she from overseas
I said, "Girl you know I love you and I care for ya
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya"
She say, "Fuck these other niggas, they ain't half of ya
Just keep laughing to the bank, it's hilarious"
I got a stay-at-home gun and a travel gun
Boy, we could sell white, in Africa
It's like, I can't explain, y'all asked me to spit
And now I'm drooling on my chain
"What happened to Wayne?"

I'm like, hold up, wait a second, y'all thought I was second?
Hating on a champ, throwing salt and not confetti
We pull up and we shoot, then we park the car and edit
Watch me pull up with no roof
Tthat's cause I walk the dog and pet it
I'm like, hold up, wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?
Shoot you in your head, then just walk off like I didn't
Let my money talk so much, put my jawbone outta business
Doing numbers in this bitch, I'm like a smart phone with the digits
Bitch!
Riding 'round with the volume down
With the windows up and the choppers down
Soon as we get to your block
It's the motherfuckin' other way around
My bitch say I'm too wild
She don't even know why she stay around
I get home and I dick her down
Now she talking 'bout exchanging vows
If these bullets was paintballs
I could fuck around and I could paint a house
You could tell I'm pimpin'
Tthe way I hit the blunt with my pinkie out
I bring wine to Amy house
We smoke it out and we drank it out
And talk about these pussy niggas
Tthat ain't about what Wayne about
I'm hangin out a Mulsanne without a brain, it's out of its mind
I pull over, I push a button, it change like Optimus Prime
Speaking of change, it's a shame how these lames droppin' them dimes
We aim at your grape, knock it off, now you just vines
Blood Gang, red rain on these niggas, hot if you dry
My gang top of the line, hollerin' out "Squad, take it outside"
I'm a taxpayer, I'm a axe player, gettin' in through the back well
Red devil to the blue collared, un-enveloped blackmail
Fed up with the fed shit and Fed-Ex lost my package
My white girls say "Yeah, nigga!" My white homies act blackish
Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL
Should've  been in N.W.A., fuck the police, Five-0 and 12
One time for your mind, bitch, never say "Nevermind," bitch
You a penny short of a dime, bitch, no nonsense
Had a nine since I was nine, bitch
Yeah, born to murder
Bank account on fat, bustin' out the girdle
Tell 'em boys ain't nothin' sweet, it's sauerkraut, ya heard me?
They find ya body in New Orleans on Mardi Gras on Bourbon
Like, oh, Lord, Humphrey Bogart
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a crowbar
For the most part, I'm the southern coast guard
AK-47 spittin' flame like a blow torch

Sorry 4 The Wait, woo

[Song 132: Dick Pleaser]
39 ContributorsDick Pleaser LyricsThis song is from the mixtape Dedication 3 and Wayne and Jae Millz are just talking about women and their sexual escapades.
Marley, I be you!
Shout-out Too Short
I'm going in
The Aphilliates, nigga! Holla at your boy

I got a bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser
But shawty from Cuba, still working on her visa
Her girlfriend, Lisa—met her in Puerto Rico
How she don't suck dick but expect for me to eat her?
I got a bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser
I got a bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser

I got a bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser
But shawty from Cuba, still working on her visa
Her girlfriend, Lisa—met her in Puerto Rico
How she don't suck dick, but expect for me to eat her?
That ho crazy, man, you don't wanna meet her
But her homegirl, Nita, swallow cum by the liter
She look good in boy shorts and a beater
But this other girl, Quita, way sexier than Nita
I ain't lying—she the... hottest bitch, heater
But I'm a fucking freezer, yeah, I'ma fucking leave her
Yeah, I'm a fucking eagle, flyer and deeper
Smoke like a Cohiba, your ho give me cerebral
Now, get low and touch your toes for my people
And if you ain't fucking them, you ain't fucking me either
You think your man hot? Well, fuck it, me: ether
Heard I got guap, wanna kick it like FIFA
Every day Christmas 'cause I'm smoking that wreath-a
Keep a lot of bitches like Queen Latifah
I am Southern-land, not Kiefer
Y-M-E for "Young Money Entertainment," ha
Run, dummy, finna bang it
You want beef? Then my money will arrange it
I am not fucking finna aim it
But that Nina Ross shout for me when I'm angry
Yeah, Hollygrove, biatch
Sloppy like Joe, you better go get G-I
All my guns knee high, M-O-N-E-Y
That's what I rely on, I'm gone
"He high"—yep, I'm three-high
I'm just schoolin' these fucks like DeVry
College institution, finals and confusion
Stop with your excuses; hip-hop, I am seducin'
Beat you like producers, eat you like produce
Man, I'll fuck your girl 'til her pussy got no juice
Now, she can't produce, so you won't be needing that, baby
'Cause all you really need is Weezy F. Baby

All right, let me vent for a minute. See, the problem I got with the game is: There are no gatekeepers in hip-hop. Who's letting these wack niggas in? I mean, can someone please put a combination lock on the door? And stop giving out the code? Goddamn! Hey, Millz, show 'em how it's done!

I knew this freak named Tammy from around the way
She used to go to Catholic school back in the day
Now, she stripping in Sue's for a stack a day
But she bring it all to Daddy, so that's okay
I got a bitch named Lola, true dick-smoker
Part-time broker; late nights, she work at Strokers
Her cousin named Mocha got a insane spine
But it's crazy 'cause I fucked 'em both at the same time
I even got a bitch in the Bay named Jessica
I swear, she might give the best mouth in America
Vanessa got a attitude, but her ass meaner
She remind me of this ho I used to fuck named Sabrina
Ugly lil' thing from the home of the Ravens
I only kept her 'round 'cause the ass was amazing
Tiffany and Emily, my bona fide sluts
When I cum, they touch tongues and share that nut
Got a white chick down in Florida named Sasha
On my mama, her head golden like an Oscar
And I met her through Tasha
At the condo, she let me fuck her on the washer
September nigga, so you know he nasty
And if she nasty, we do the nasty
Now, I tell a bitch like this
You gotta take ten dicks before you meet the president
Young Money! (Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!)

Okay, I know this one honey
I call her "Track Star" 'cause when we fuck, she run from me
And I'm hella fly, and her dude dumb-bummy
And I don't get girls, I make her get one for me
My weed real plummy and real gummy
And my flow is harder than an anvil, honey
Shoot these niggas with the handheld, honey
I paper-chase, fuck standstill money
Niggas kill with me and kill for me
Best believe we riding if the fan belt running
Leave a motherfucker just laying there, bloody
I'm from the Dirty and I make it rain—damn, that's muddy!
She just wanna be my cuddy buddy
And on these tracks, I go nutty-butty
What it dizz-oo? Is you or is you ain't my baby?
Baby?

Mack in here
Pooh in here
Scoob in here with me
Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell ’em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
I’ma cut this music down, tell 'em put they APs up
Tell 'em throw they pride out, roll the windows back up
Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
AK-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down, then them hoes get passed up
Sittin’ on this money to me feel like a cactus
I’m stickin' to this shit, you would’ve been have hopped yo' ass up

Tell 'em, I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)

Yeah I got hittas woadie, yeah I got plenty woadie
They kick the door and kill yo’ ass and leave the children snorin'
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, make me feel important
I made some green in the past and now it's good as golden, yeah

I'm so lifted, I'm so lifted
I wrote my will in hieroglyphics (In hieroglyphics)
Weezy, where you been? The people miss you
Crickets
I got hittas and they not kidders, that's my niggas
You got niggas but they not hittas, they got jitters
They get hit up, I'm placin' figures on your niggas
Takin' bidders, yo' bae, yo' niggas, don't make a difference
I got shooters, on pharmaceuticals​, they armed and brutal
Warn intruders, 'cause we don't doodle, we draw conclusions
I got sprayers, all type of sprayers, we gon' need Google
I got paper, on top of paper, we gon' need rulers
I'm effective, been doin' numbers since Roman numerals
Strong as sumo, we armed as usual, my hittas hungry
Charleston Chew you, bazookas chew you, just like Bazookas
Don't confuse 'em, we only hittas, y'all only humans
Don't get hit up, woadie (Hit up, woadie, hit up, woadie)
'Cause I got hittas woadie

I told her to come over, she said, "Ok, don't fall asleep"
She say she can be my housewife and keep my house clean
I say, "Shut the fuck up, put this dick back in your mouth please"
I don't see nothing wrong with some mouth and lip service
Tunechi in this bitch, I'm tighter than a pinched nerve, bitch
I didn't answer my phone, I said I couldn't get service
My new Nina just told me that she sick of being a virgin

Bagging up the work for a hour, fingers hurtin'
Let my bitches help, before they leave, I check their purses
Sorry for the wait, the confusion, the disturbance
Got me movin' weight, prostitution, and these verses
Whippin' in the kitchen, in the trap house with my shirt off
I'ma get these millions and I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin', talkin' 'bout the third ward
The D.A. was a dick and the Judge was a jerkoff

Got a bad bitch, body curvy like a curveball
Let her drink too much, now her pussy taste like Smirnoff
Sleepin' on chinchilla, boy, I'm cozy like a furball
Fuck the other side, nigga, we could have a turf war
Sorry for the wait, had to drop this part two and shit
Just to let you know that a nigga still doin' it
Workin' like a slave, on my Roots Part Two shit
Got to let 'em know that Lil Tunechi still Tunechi, bitch
Bop-bop-bop!
Fuck with me wrong, get that hammer
Thank God I'm home from the slammer was gone for that hammer
Stompin' the yard like a gamma
Niggas was goin' bananas, I'm calm like a camel
I'm smokin' that strong like a Camel
I bet my life when we gamble
Y'all shippin' keys, we shippin' grand pianos
I'm in that Lam' Diablo
Pew, like ammo, I'm gone
Two fingers up, bitch, I'm gone
Rich Forever, Jerry Jones
I gotta hustle, keepin' my destiny goin'
Like the House of Deréon
This plane that I'm on is private, my very own
So no checkin' my carry-ons
She sent a picture naked, I said, "It's on"

But she live in Fort Lauderdale and I'm closer to South Beach
I told her to come over, she said, "Ok, don't fall asleep"
She say she can be my housewife and keep my house clean
I say, "Shut the fuck up, put this dick back in your mouth please"
I don't see nothing wrong with some mouth and lip service
Tunechi, motherfucker, tighter than a pinched nerve, bitch
I didn't answer my phone, I said I couldn't get service
My new Nina just told me that she sick of being a virgin

Now I don't get excited, nigga, I just get exotic
I don't get invited to these bitches pity parties
I don't do narcotic even though a nigga got it
Countin' all this money, I feel like I got arthritis

Baggin' up the work for a hour, fingers hurtin'
Let my bitches help, before they leave I check their purses
Sorry for the wait, the confusion, the disturbance
Boy, we movin' weight, prostitution, and these verses
Whippin' in the kitchen, in the trap house with my shirt off
I'm gon' get these millions and I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin', talking 'bout the third ward
The DA was a dick and the Judge was a jerk off

We yellin'
Suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Yeah, you hear us yellin'
Suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Blood gang, nigga
And it's that Sorry 4 the Wait 2, woo
And I'm so sorry for the wait too, yeah
Sorry for the wait
Had to drop that part two and shit
Just to let you know that a nigga still doin' it
Workin' like a slave, talking Roots part two and shit
Sorry for the wait
Lil Tunechi still Tunechi, bitch, yeah

When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us
Love only lasts if my heart races on
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yeah, on
I'm racing on, yeah
My heart races on

Uh, I'm priceless
Remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me, and continue to bite me
Got no degree, but where I'm from that’s the original climate
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond
Hold on
Lord, if my Bugatti come to a dead-end
I've already been everywhere except Heaven
And tomorrow’s not promised
When I'm gone but not forgotten
I hope my homies calming down my mama, Lord
I guess I'll see you on that other side
Where the flowers never die the angels never lie
Yeah, the revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized
Lord, mama hate I got my daddy’s eyes
Never looked into my daddy’s eyes
He ain't have the time
Fuck him
The revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized

When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us (Hold on)
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster (Hold on)
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yeah (I'm gone)
On (I'm gone)
I'm racing on, yeah (I'm gone)
My heart races on

Uh, Tunechi, you an angel
Must be here for a reason, and that might be the main one
Fuck it, I'm making money before making changes
I sold my soul to the devil, he bought it, then exchanged it
Fuck it, I'm working, bitch, I know you see me working
Searching for better days before a better person
I'm perfect
Just ask my bitch and she’ll say that so urgent
I purchase
My children gifts and I just keep the curses
Yeah
My heart right, and my head ain't
'Cause I'm never in my right mind
But I'm Einstein when I do think
And I grew wings
If you catch a feather, just keep it
And I’ll be racing on; no shortcuts, no cheating

When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us (Hold on)
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)
So I step on the gas (Errrr)
Burning faster and faster (Hold on)
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
(My heart right and my head ain't)
I'm racing on, yeah (I'm gone)
On (I'm gone)
I'm racing on, yeah
(There’s nothing left but to fly high
If you catch a feather just keep it)
My heart races on

This morning I woke up on my good side
Life is just a race against time so have a good time
Heart racing, thoughts racing
Competition, goodbye
I turn around and run backwards
To see what second place look like
Oh Lord, what are we running from?
The police, 'cause they already killed enough of us
Stay out them streets 'cause they don’t fuck with us
They hunting us
We in a race against racists, that’s a color run
I keep my feet above the ground
We gon' run the town
Heart racing on, beat-beat-beating, knock and pound
Love marathon, getting deeper by the mile
I see no finish line, on your mark, set, pow

Uh-huh
Yeah, I'm in the lab, no pad, no pen
Just a styrofoam cup I can pour a four in

Up in the studio, me and my drank
Deezle on the beat, and let me do my thing
Thinking 'bout a certain, certain somebody
That perfect somebody, sexy purple body
She got service road curves, and highway eyes
The road to her soul, just follow the road signs
And holler if you hear me, I love it when she's near me
I hate when she's away, and Satan'll see the day
That Hell freeze over before I let her go
And let one of you bitch niggas get her; no, no, no
You don't know how to treat her
You don't know that I need her
Hey, do you know that I need you?
'Cause baby, right now, it feel like the whole world is against me
Ever since the death of Pimp C

But me, I'm up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
I'm up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
And you sit on 24's, I sip on 24's
You sit on 24's, I sip on 24's
Drop a four in a 20 ounce and call it 24's
Drop a four in a 20 ounce and call it 24's

I'm riding out, leaning, never nodding out
My girl tripping, damn I gotta hear my momma mouth
My homeboys say I should slow down a little
But that shit I'm on make me slow down a lot
You bottle-pop, I buy a bottled pop
Drop some syrup in it, get out my Waffle House
I live in Wayne's World, represent our South
And this how we do it, do it in our South

One more ounce'd make me feel so great
Wait, now I can't feel my face
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
Will somebody please, please, double-cup me?
And everybody please, please, don't judge me
Will somebody please, please, double-cup me?
And everybody please, please, don't judge me

Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank (Yeah) me-me-me and my drank

Now for all y'all who ain't heard of him
Mr. M-O-E, the Barre Baby
Was a Southside living legend
The 3rd Ward, bone hard, street veteran
And it all started in '93
High school, he was the fool, he was only 18
With the dreams of becoming a ghetto superstar
Rollin' in foreign cars through the streets of 3rd Ward
It was all momma leave 'em with, a trace of Mo-E
And promethazine, now he the codeine fiend
And his team was the coldest, every day they rolled thick
Niggas and hoes on dick 'cause that's that Screwed Up Click

The Barre Baby, the Barre Baby, Barre Baby
Yeah, I sip that Big Moe, I drink that Pimp C
Rest in peace Big Moe, rest in peace Pimp C
I sip that Big Moe, I drink that Pimp C
Rest in peace Big Moe, rest in peace Pimp C
And fuck what they say
Mr. DJ Screw, I'ma do this for you

Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank (Yeah, yeah)
Me and my drank, me-me-me and my drank
I usually don't do this but, uh...

Yeah, T you gotta feel me
Sippin' on some drank the color purple like Celie
Really, they say I should chill before it kills me
But so will a car crash or a nine milli (That's true)
And I ain't even mention cigarettes or airplanes
So grab a Sprite, here's a pint we can share, Wayne
Yeah mayne, tastes so sweet
And I ain't gonna have a seat 'cause I don't wanna fall asleep
So just pour it in my drink and I'ma sip until I lean hard
Drank got me moving slower than a retard
So press record, and hear these hot raps (You know I got 'em)
I'm in the booth, cup on me like a jock-strap (I ain't lying)
And I will not nap until the bottle's empty
Then I pour a little more for Pat, Screw, and Pimp C (Rest in peace)
And I would stop, but believe that I can't
So 'til Short is gone, it's just me and my drank, my drank

Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me-me and my drank
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me-me and my drank

Me and my drank
Up in the studio, someone pour another four
Oh, oh, yeah
I told the bitch, one more ounce will make me feel so great
Wait, now I can't feel my face
Will somebody please, please, double cup me?
And tell the world please, please, don't judge me
Will somebody please, please, double cup me?
And everybody please, please, don't judge me
You sit on 24's, we sip on 24's
You sit on 24's; we, we, we
Drop a four in the 20 ounce and call it 24's
Drop a four in the 20 ounce and call it 24's
Yeah, I'm in the lab, no pad, no pen
Just a styrofoam cup I can pour a four in

[Song 139: New Slaves]
76 ContributorsNew Slaves LyricsWeezy samples New Slaves, from Kanye West’s latest album Yeezus.
I got old money, take a bath in hundreds
My way or the highway and I see traffic comin'
It's Tunechi in this ho, watch them hoes go crazy
Pass that weed around, like that shit contagious
And I got news for all these snitches, tell them feds stop bitchin'
If pussy lips could talk, I'd go down there like it's whisperin'
You know life is so uncertain and death is so unwanted
My navigation system say, "It's death around the corner"
I got a condo for a stash house, a condo for a stash house
Get that boy a mirror, so he can watch his damn mouth
See I get it from Sosa, he got it from Frank
And Sosa alright, but I'm tryin' to meet Frank
He said business is well, he ain't got no complaints
You'll be Batman and I'll be robbin' the bank
I know I ain't gon' fall, even though I'm power trippin'
Glass house nigga, you see how I'm livin'
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new age
Ain't no such thing as too paid

Like it's freezing and you naked, shake that ass ho
Shake that ass ho

When we throw a pool party, we put sharks in the pool
I got Bloods in the cut, so don't throw salt in the wound
AK wet niggas up, I don't throw water balloons
Better call the platoon
If it's fuck it then fuck it, now you speakin' my language
Put your dead body under them white sheets with no blankets
I'm so rich I go pour
Champagne and don't drink it
Ice on my neck like I fainted
These are the thoughts of the brainless
No new friends, we don't talk to strangers
Man I'm so serious with this pimp shit
Full clip in my Mac 10
Ain't no exit out the game, nigga cut off your blinkers
And if she married I fuck her, if she lonely I fuck her
If she crazy I love her, y'all just don't understand her
She say you got it made, I say no I got a butler
They tell me to turn up, but I'm the knob on the oven
I got a knife in my pocket if there's a fork in the road
I'm the man of steel, but I won't say what I stole
Bring that coke to the stove, and whip it like a new slave
Whip it like a new slave

Like it's freezing and you naked, shake that ass ho
Shake that ass ho

D5
Whattup five
Take that coke to the stove
And whip it like a new slave, whip it like a new slave
Like it's freezing and you naked shake that ass ho

[Song 140: Mahogany]
65 ContributorsMahogany Lyrics
Check

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward, I race a NASCAR
Transport just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing
Yeah, I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out
Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile
8 Ball from Orange Mound, letdown, I lay her down
Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda
And your trap house closin', your glass house broken
And my madhouse open and my lighthouse glowin'

Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy
Brains all over my mahogany dashboard

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
I think in my backyard, I need an airport
Mahogany sand, boy, I start a sand storm
Mahogany skin, touch me, I cut your hands off
Mahogany door handle to match the floor panel
Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandals
Mahogany dash, slime, I do the dash, slime
Sit the coke on the glass, slime, she snort a flat line
Good times, no hard times, uh-oh, it's that time
We at war, I check my Chopard for the exact time
Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' Fab Five
Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire
Plug was a fucking Arabi, it's no cap, slime
Judge gave me time, I did that time like nap time
Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it
I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'
Under the skully, these bright mahogany dreads showin'
Let's get in bed and break these mahogany headboards
Oh, woah, mahogany, yeah, woah

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Uh, yeah, I do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy
Brains all over my mahogany dashboard

Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys
Louis, Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys
Soon as we land, on mahogany sand
Maho-mahogany sand
Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys
Soon as we land, on mahogany sand
I ain't arguin', I'm sayin'
Ooh, mahogany

[Song 141: Fuckin’ Problems]
69 ContributorsFuckin’ Problems Lyrics
I love all my bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
A two dollar bill is still a couple dollars
And if any one of them niggas got a fuckin' problem
I'ma milk all of 'em 'cause they fuckin' cowards
I love red bitches, there's just something 'bout 'em
But I'm gettin' better pussy from a brown one
Been schoolin' y'all niggas, I'm your alma mater
I'm the shit, where the fly swatter

I know you dykin' who you eatin' on
Make me think about all them nights we got a threesome on
Make me think about how you suck it like your teeth are gone
If your friends hatin' on you, fuck 'em, to each his own, yessir
I do my drugs then I sleep 'em off
Like it just be callin' me, I need to turn my ringer off
Ain't a fuckin' singalong unless you brought the weed along
That kush, okay I got it, that kush
Cop pounds and put my people on
We can take the stairs up to the stars, that's where we belong
Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian, or like Jordan, beat the buzzer
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher
One man band, all you hear is repercussion
Told a bitch, too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction
She looked me in my eyes and said
"Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'", I said "shorty, you a beast"

I love bad bitches, okay, what's the problem
If she thinks she gonna come up, then I'ma fuckin' drown her
I'm wilder than public schools and public housing
Can't afford failure, I'm just browsing
I was 15 with $100,000
And if you talk trash I'ma fuckin' possum
And nigga, if your bitch got a eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery
Tunechi

I heard 'em tell me "Go get 'em, young"
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one
I be in a room full of bitches gettin' drunk
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin' on what I had, but
We gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag (You choose)
And all these new bitches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like "That's prolly gon' bruise"
And every dream girl that I fucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby, "Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes"
And I murder that pussy, and I ain't leave a clue
'Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof
That sick shit, I'm ill, yeah, I'm a fuckin' problem
I'm fine wit' it, though, bitches like fuckin' problems
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms
(Euro)

I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
Had a few ugly bitches but I had to hide 'em
Can't live with 'em, Can't live without 'em
Can't trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, does that make you childish
Now she say I got a fuckin' problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum should pay me
I ain't looking for a lady, call Will Smith to get you hitched
I ain't looking for a wife, I need a one night trick
That can ride it like that, suck it like this
Hit it from the back in the back of the whip
I'm a mac, I'm a pimp, girl
You don't need make up, put this mac on your lips
She drive a X5, beefin' with her ex man
Baby, I'ma dog and a DMX fan
Told myself I wouldn't mess with my ex again
Popped a lil x then I tried to explain
I keep it too real to ever be a lame
Too many girls in this world, you all be lame
She all on my dick 'cause I got street fame
Told that thirsty ass bitch don't speak my name
Kidd Kidd, a nut from the 9
Tell 'em don't worry 'bout me, I'm just fine
Girl, if you comin' with me then let's ride
I know you want money so don't waste my time
Uh, wear that ass out fuck her till we pass out
Fuck a hotel, we goin' to my mans house
Scratch that your baby mama was an Amtrak
We treat that pussy like some good weed and pass that
Yeah, to my niggas, she fuck my niggas
Bought some bitches, and she was wit' it
With you she wasn't, but she did it
She let you lick it, but never stick it
You be trippin', you say you fallin'
Nigga you slippin', stupid ass nigga tryna' fall in love
If I fall, it's gon' be from too many drugs
You asking questions, 'bout what she was
With the rider game, she told you in the club

[Song 142: Awkward]
25 ContributorsAwkward Lyrics
See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool
And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it

See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Cause every time she try to tell me something, she open up her mouth, I stick my tongue in
She got a piercing in her vagina, a skirt with nothing under
And she say when she don't see me, she feels like Stevie Wonder

That's when I said, "Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt"
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind

See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool

Uh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip when she like that dick
Ooh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip don't fight that dick girl, girl
Fucking with you, well, I'ma need another shower
I'ma need another shower
Can you help me take another shower?
Then we gonna make each other shout

There's steam in the air, fog everywhere
She can get her hair wet cause it's her real hair
I be like, "Hell Yeah"
And she be like, "Fucking right"
Now she got one leg in the air, I'm pulling on her hair
And she say I can pull it, cause it's her real hair
She be like, "Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah" cause I fuck her right

That's when I said, "Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt"
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind
Then I said, "See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward"

[Song 143: Don’t Kill]
72 ContributorsDon’t Kill LyricsThe first song Lil Wayne Spits on D5 is over a Kendrick Lamar instrumental “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe”
And if I fuck her, she gon' get attached
Who invited all these fuck-niggas?
Man, shit ain't ever smell this good
Why them snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these niggas, wake me up when it's all over

Bitch, come kill my time, but bitch don't steal my shine
I'm cooking up two quarters, bout' to get rich or die tryin'
I got some killer's on my side, some kill up in my swisher
All this hatin' drive me crazy, take the key out the ignition
Oh my god it feel like Coogi weather
I lost my mind, but I got it back like groovy Stella
Tell them hoes I got that Victoria Secret weapon
I hope you live a double life cause you gon' need an extra
Me and my niggas we got bad bitches up in the pool
Bad bitches up in the pool
She gon' learn tonight, call that shit night school
And life is a bitch on her cycle, delightful
Got ho's on that powder, like light blue
Nice move, now king me nigga
Badass bitch, you seen me with her, we on that
GT Vodka, straight out the bottle, genie nigga
The difference between me and these niggas, is
I go hard and they go wrong
She say, "Hit it from the back," I'm tryin' to leave that crack alone baby

And if she love me, I'mma love her back
Who indictin' all the tough niggas?
We smoke that skunk that's always smellin' good
But why these snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these nigga's, wake me up when it's all over

Street sweepers and millimeters, AK's and skateboards
Let 'em know we got beef for anyone who got a taste for it
Real nigga to the bone, bristle
Cocaine, like co cripple
Heard niggas been waitin' on me, well I might as well go and tip 'em
I'm smokin' on that Hulk Hogan
I call shots, you call forward
I pimp my ride, my car's ho-in'
And all my bars be barcoded
These YMCMB stars glowin'
Hate a ho-nigga, like anchovies
My young bitch keep on snappin' on me, I told that bitch I ain't posing
That pussy feel like a pot of gold
The money old and the night is young
All them niggas keep talkin' shit
I make you eat your words and bite your tongue
And when the guns ring I'm the ring leader
Got those ho's on pins and needles
I'm so high I left Earth
And ran into Venus and Serena
Get head like a mind reader
You washed up, I'm the dry cleaner
Don't worry about me, nigga I'm one-
Hundred like a high fever
Got pounds takin' up closet space
Guns all in my bitch crib
Since all you nigga's fly now, bugs all on my windshield

And if she tense, then I'mma rub her back
She alright, I think I fuck with her
Man, I wish a motherfucker would
I feel like a hockey puck nigga
Way too cold to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cold to die young, give these niggas the cold shoulder
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, another bitch when I roll over
We fuck until we fall asleep, wake up and do it all over

D5
What up 5? (Kendrick)
What up 5?

Old pussy in a can, red is the flag
Fuck with me wrong, I'll put your head in your hands
There'd be blood everywhere, I got Bloods everywhere
I'm a alien, I hope you ain't the Prince of Bel-Air
That's real nigga talk, these niggas speechless
Cut off his arm and leg like I charge for my features
Hammer on my side like I work in construction
Your bitch hit that head so hard, we get concussions
Niggas can't see me, not even a glimpse
Too many banana clips, I feel like chimps
South Beach bitch and her tan line stupid
You could find me on Collins like Bootsy
I ain't on no fuck shit, I be on that Trukfit
Your girl do tongue tricks, and you sweeter than one-six
All I ever see is Ben Franklin face
I chase the bank, I don't bank with Chase
You fuckin' with some niggas that'll murk y'all
Nigga, you softer than a motherfuckin' Nerf ball—bird call!
Brrrr! What happened to that boy?
He was talkin' shit, we put a clap into that boy
Tunechi!

Ooh, L-Don
Fuck that interface, dawg, go to work, yeah
Picante in this bitch with me
Fuq', hit the weed
You got all that shit? Yeah, ugh, ugh

I got Young Money up, and now, I got my feet up
Tune in this bitch, tell my niggas throw them Bs up
Doing what the fuck I want, hate me all the fuck you want
Real niggas fuck with me, and I don't give a fuck who don't
Lock the CEO up; and I'm the CEO, fuck
Prison in February, and I ain't in no rush
Drink 'til I throw up; nigga, roll more blunts
Ball so hard, man, I gotta go pro once
Hit 'em with the shotgun, call that shit the "stop button"
Call me Dr. Carter, AKA "Young Wild Nigga"
AKA "No trial, nigga," AK, click-clack, pow, nigga
Fucking with the kid and you'll be missing like Bilal, nigga
Yeah! Haha! Swagger stupid, pack a Uzi
Hundred clips, nigga? That's a movie — Aim at your toupée
You sweet as Kool-Aid, cream brulée
I'm sharp as Blu-Ray, I fuck her today
Then she gotta skate — Young Lupe
I hit the beat hard — Bobby Boucher
I keep them tools on me, get the screwface
Flowers for the dead, here's a bouquet
L.V.'s, nigga, on every suitcase
Y.M., nigga, it's a new day
We the champions, nigga, hoo-ray
Yeah! Hammer in the Louis duff'
Take a nigga bitch, she gave me brains until I knew enough
Bullet come too fast to adjust
I don't give a fuck about my roof that much
So I put it in the trunk and then the coupe sped up
Take the chopper out the trunk and just shoot that up
I'm Weezy F., and the "F" is for "Flame"
Eat these rappers, chef up the game
Shit on the track, shit on the train
Murder the beat—the beat was slain
Rest In Peace; that's a shame, he kill anybody song
Versatile as fuck, I switch it up like Dennis Rodman dome
No homo, you rocking wrong; Rest In Peace, my styrofoam
Now they wanna know what I be on
Get the fuck off my dick, my cock, my bone
B—Big money, my pockets long; New Orleans, I got my home
And they got my back—pause; no homo, no maricón
Smoking on that private-grown, it put me where I belong
All about my cheese; cheddar, mozzarella, provolone
Fuck her for an hour-long, let her take a shower, gone
Sorry baby, but I'm in my I-don't-wan'-be-bothered zone
Yeah! Haha, you're a groupie, get on your duty
Two women give me head, call that "Two-face"
Bitch, I'm too great, take your food tray, I was born on doomsday
Ugh! Ai—Ain't no nigga like me
"What's up?" to my gang, big Bs, like a Breitling
Take a nigga bitch, she ride my dick, like she cycling
Then, she can't walk, run, or jump; like white men
Ugh! F—Fuck you niggas wanna do?
No Ceilings, let the bullets rain on you
Weezy F., the "F" is for "Fuck what you’re going through"
Make your people mourn you

Haha! OK, let's do it

Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me (Yeah)
God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
And look alive, look alive

Smoke one, ready to po' one, tote one, scared of no one
You never know when your close ones is a pussy 'til your nose run
Bickin' back bein' bool, trigger happiest goons
Bigger mansion and pool, I need a map for this room
Don't need a casket to view 'em, you can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on, all the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sams card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head, bad hair day
In broad day like "let's play," lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song
In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm
Rum-bum-bum-bum-bum, if they come for 'em, I tell 'em

God took his time when he made me
Got my pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me

Sorry, boys, bar is closin', where we goin' for breakfast?
Put pressure on the precious, and put extra on the extras
Extra ready for my presents, extra sexy but she selfish
Just want me to see selfies of the pelvis, overwhelmin'
Talkin' money over salmon in Italian in Australia
Fuck it even have some salad, I'm just valuin' the value
Wake up and smell the azaleas sang her prayers like Mahalia
I just don't know what to tell ya, but, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Devil lies jumpin' at ya, comin' from what's comin' at ya
I come from where they come at ya, in a way you can't come back from
I attack from every crack, while you been chillin', I been active
I been still inside the action, you been actin'
I been buildin', you been blabbin', you been bickerin', I been blackin'
I been sippin' like the Dracula, I been feelin' like Galactus
Got a million in the mattress, a gazillion in the pantry
If you don't know I'm the answer, you should kill who you been askin'

Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
Look alive, look alive

Look alive, look alive, yeah
Look alive, look alive
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Look alive, look alive
Carter Five, Carter Five, yeah
Carter Five, Carter Five
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Song 147: Sweet Dreams]
49 ContributorsSweet Dreams Lyrics
Turn the lights on

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on, yo)

Yo, Young Money right here
Bike gear, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddy Krueger, I'm a rap bitch nightmare
And I'm rich, I could buy you
Kill bitches, leave they body in the Bayou
More brain than a IQ
More head than a dread, my youte
And my bank account ain't hardly empty
That's why I come through in a Barbie Bentley
So please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry
Who's next to go? My flow's so flexible
Get gas, then get at me, Texaco
Shoot yourself in the leg, Plaxico
White jag with the twisted lip
I ain't Mike Jack but "This Is It"
B-b-b-boo, I'm everywhere
You like balloon boy, mama, you was never there
I am the Kung Fu Panda
Fuck all your blogs, fuck all your propaganda
Good for the goose, then its good for the gander
Nicki ain't a rapper, Nicki is a brander
Please, you can never compare to me
All these bitches is scared of me
I am who they couldn't even dare to be
So that's all folks, badabadee
I go hard, pause
Hospital flow, get more gauze
I'm a bad bitch on all fours
The President be like, "It's all yours"
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch
Go together like a team in the gym
Kareem and the ring, the queen and the king

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part (No Ceilings)
What kind of dream is this?
You could be a sweet–

Uh, kush it out, red bone, pussy, mouth
Eat you up, spit you out, fuck your girl in yo' house
I'm terrible, be careful, you might want say a prayer or two
So cold, I need theraflu, I'm so high, I need parachutes
I'm error proof, I'm never spooked, got my coupe, heaven blue
And my flag red as hell, think you're sweet as devils food
I never lose, my weapons use
Fuck wit' me wrong, shit get ugly, Devin Dude
And she's the queen, two's a couple, three’s a scene
Weezy that nigga that you see in your dreams, get the pussy wet, Abita Springs
Hah, I'm Easter clean, shout to my home girl, Mika Means
Anything we want we redeem, you niggas gassed up, '93 Supreme
Nicki Minaj is the hardest bitch, more than an artist, bitch
She talk a whole lot of shit and walk around like she President Carter's bitch
She be on her Barbie shit, and me? I'm on Tha Carter VI
And I can turn crumbs to bricks, and I can turn nuns to tricks
Hah, Young Mula baby, f-fuck your feelings
And this is No Ceilings, yeah

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

Ah-ha!
Uh

Man, fuck them bitches and them hoes
And them niggas pussies, camel toes
I got some money on me, and the weed nice
My shit won't ever stop, suck my green light
Bitch, it's Carter 4, murder's all she wrote
Now it's fuck everybody, like a Scorpio
Still running shit; I'm on my cardio
Boy I'm going in, like my water broke
Suicide note, suicide doors
I put in overtime, like a tied score
Tinted windows, bitch, that mean mind yours
And the weed loud, like a lion's roar
Stare into the eyes, the eyes of forever
Hear no evil, see no evil; Helen Keller
No music on, rock it acapella
And I don't need a watch; the time is now or never
Tell my niggas love, I die behind this shit
A nigga counting money, you niggas counterfeit
Real nigga, nigga, proud of what I am
Young Money is an army, bitch, I'm Uncle Sam
Them hoes call me Tunechi, mama call me Tune
I left the bullshit in the waiting room
Straight to the money, no short cuts
Now watch me go retarded, yellow short bus
We do drive-bys, we do walk-ups
And bitch I be so high, I get starstruck
Millz in this bitch, he said, "fuck them hoes"
And the jewelry bright, like summer clothes
And I keep some bud, like Rudy Huxtable
I'm 'bout to slam the beat, nigga, Dusty Rhodes
I'm from Eagle Street; I go Hercules
I get on the beat, murder 1st degree
YMCMB, we don’t give a fuck
You faker than some titties; you get tittie fucked, hah!
This the best worst feeling
And nigga if I die, I die a death worth living, uh
This that text book G shit
I've been in that water, but I never been sea sick
Yeah, knock me I knock ya face off
Life's a crazy bitch; Grace Jones
Mind of a genius with a heart of stone, heh
C4, Mr. Carter's home!

And if you feel like you're the best
Go 'head and do the Weezy-We, and
Phone home (Weezy)
Phone home (Weezy)

We are not the same, I am a Martian
And I'm hotter than summer rain like Carl Thomas
Lock, load, ready to aim at any target
I could get your brains for a bargain like I bought it from Target
Hip hop is my supermarket
Shopping cart full of fake hip-hop artists
I'm starving, sorry, I gotta eat all it
And I'll be back in the morning

Phone home (Weezy)

Like Gonzales, young college
Student, who done just flipped the game like Houston
I'm used to promethazine in two cups, I'm screwed up
And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up
Flow so sick, make you wanna throw your food up
Ice water chest, and my wrist like a cool cup
Two twin clippers, I give your ass a crew cut
I get bread like cold cuts, you know what?
Your girl go down fast, come up slow, but I never slow up
Weezy

Phone home (Weezy)

Phone home (Weezy)
Phone home (Weezy)
And if you feel like you're the best

They don't make 'em like me no more
Matter of fact, they never made it like me before
I'm rare, like Mr. Clean with hair
No brake lights on my car rear
I never had life and I never had fear
I rap like I done died and gone to heaven, I swear
And yeah, I'm a bear, like black and white hair, so I'm polar
And they can't get on my system 'cause my system is the solar
I am so far from the othars, I meant others
I just eat them for supper, get in my spaceship and hover, hover

Phone home (Weezy)
Phone home (Weezy)

And if you feel like you're the best
Go 'head and do the Weezy-We, and

Girls that don't do girls, that's that shit I don't like
Dick in her mouth, bitch eatin' her out, that's that shit my girl like
I'm layin' back with my feet up, bad bitch: D cups
All I had was one molly, she took half: prenup
I just licked my thumb and thumbed through that pussy like a catalog
All my niggas wanna fuck, and she gon let us like a salad bar
Yeah that's right, real shit, murderer, I kill kill
Cash Money, cash cow that never cry over spilled milk
I'm way high on the highway, my girl call to get my lies straight
That machine gun go "brrrrr" like I got that bitch on vibrate
Niggas think they hot, I cut off the hand they fan with
Call me DMX, cause I keep me a bad bitch
T called some of them hoes up, Marley G roll up
I'm gettin' bread like cold cuts, she suck dick till her nose run, yeah
A rich nigga that that shit they don't like
All you niggas pussies, none of you pussies tight
Gettin' head while I drive make me run lights
These hoes wanna ride my dick you gotta hitchhike
No lie, I'm fuckin' bitches and gettin' paid
She suck my dick for 60 seconds and swallow all my Minute Maid
No lie, I'm gettin' paid and fuckin' bitches
The Feds on me, gotta switch plates
In the streets we call that washin' dishes
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on the nine-milly
T-roll my blunt long as a lifespan then I kill it
Eatin' pussy, tongue kissin' and all that
She ridin' a nigga so fast, my dick feel like it's been carjacked
Two guns drawn, art class, what that is that's y'all ass
Mo' money, mo' money, we gettin' mow like tall grass
We are not one and the same
Blood is the gang, it run in my veins
I bagged your bitch then fuck her
Now come get your bitch from baggage claim, nigga!
Dr. Carter, fuck her harder
All my homies bald, nigga
And guess what? I'm the barber
I'm too high; if I come down my fat pocket's my shock absorber
Like Hank Gathers I'mma die a baller, you flamin' faggots put him out with water
Ugh! See that's that shit I don't like
Knock off your whole left side, now you all right
Yeah white diamonds, Vanilla Ice
My nigga Tunechi, yeah that nigga nice
Dedication 4, ho
