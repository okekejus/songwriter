For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

When I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby, and nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks (Woo)
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing 'cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'

You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies

'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?

Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning
But hey now (Hey now), you know, girl (You know, girl)
We both know, it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, love me
As long as you love me, love me

I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress (Don't stress), and don't cry (And don't cry)
Oh, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take (Take), my hand

Now we on top of the world (World) 'cause that's just how we do (Do it)
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man, we stepping out, like woah (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot (Shoot)
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it

But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new

Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second

And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid

Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

Shoutout to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)

Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter

Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now

Got that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
This how I feel, act like you know that you are

She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles

Learn them the hard way

Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach

And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach

And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is

I will fight 'till forever (Make it right)
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
And never say never

(Pick it up, pick, pick it up) Ne-Never say never
(Pick it up, pick, pick it up) Ne-Never say never
(Pick it up, pick, pick it up) Ne-Never say never
(Pick it up, pick, pick it up) Never say it, never-never say it

I never thought that I could feel this power (Eh)
I never thought that I could feel this free (Eh)
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower (Yeah)
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh

'Cause there's just no turning back (Oh, no)
When your heart's under attack (Oh, no)
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny

I will never say never (Never say never; I will fight)
I will fight 'till forever (Never fighting, but I'm still fighting; Make it right)
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up (Yeah)
And never say never (Never, never, never, never)

Here we go (Guess who?)
J. Smith and JB (Uh-huh)
I gotcha, lil bro (Oh, no)
I can handle them, hold up, aight? (Never, never, never say it)
I can handle them

(Pick it up, pick) Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
(Pick it up, pick) And he's older than me and stronger than me
(Pick it up, pick) And his arms a little bit longer than me
(Pick it up, pick) But he ain't on a JB song with me (Oh)
(Pick, pick it up) I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
(Pick it up, pick, pick it up) No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
(Pick, pick it up) Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
(Pick it up, pick, pick it up) Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood (Let's go)
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest (Fly, fly)
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant (What? What?)
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land (Yeah, yeah; I'm gone)

I will never say never (Never say it, never-never say it; I will fight)
I will fight 'til forever (Okay, okay; To make it right)
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground (Oh, woah)
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up (Yeah)
And never say never (Never say never)
I will never say never (Never say it, never-never say it; Never say never)
I will fight 'till forever (Okay; To make it right)
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
And never say never

It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make sense when it's empty (Oh no)

I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world
Ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah

It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
'Less I'm doing it with you baby
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world
Ain't the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Going way up, way up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Way up, way up, way up)
(Yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?
Live forever young
It’s amazing
I don't want to sleep 'less you at home

It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense

You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure

Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure

Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain’t got no place to be
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no, no

I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the cross lights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

You ain't gotta make your mind up
(make your mind up)
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
(right now)
Don't rush, no pressure
(there ain't no pressure)
You ain't gotta make your mind up
(no ohh)
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
(I'll be waiting for you)
Don't rush, no pressure
(baby don't rush)
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure
(You can take it easy now)
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
(And I'll still be right here)
Don't rush , no pressure

Say yeah, say yeah
You ain't gotta make your mind up now
Know I did you wrong
Let your heart heal
Don't rush, no pressure

It's your world, and I'm just in it
Even sober, I'm not thinkin' straight

'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh

Too late, now you're in my blood
I don't hate the way you keep me up

Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight

Justin Bieber
Pop star Justin Bieber
Denied he fathered a child
There is a lot of good that comes with celebrity, you know that
Yeah
There is also a pretty white hot spotlight
Of course
And you found yourself under it recently, some headlines
To set the record straight, none of it is true
Do you know this woman?
Never met the woman, so
No? Okay, well, obviously this is what comes along with, uh
Exactly
Life in the fast lane, as they say

She said she met me on the tour
She keeps knockin' on my door
She won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl, she wouldn't stop
Almost had to call the cops
She was schemin', ooh, she was wrong

'Cause she wanted all my attention (Hey)
And she was dragging my name through the dirt (Oh)
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn’t give it to her (I'm talking to you)

Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby (No), that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby (No), she ain't my girl
'Cause she's talking it and she needs to quit
'Cause I never hit, so I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby (That's not my baby), that ain't my girl (No)
And she wilding out, what she talkin' 'bout?
Let me tell you now, this girl, she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Now she's in the magazines
On TV making a scene
Oh, she's crazy, crazy in love
And she's all over the news
Saying everything but the truth
She's faking, faking it all

'Cause she wanted all my attention (Hey)
And she was dragging my name through the dirt (Oh)
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad cause I didn’t give it to her (I'm talking to you)

Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby (No), that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby (No), she ain't my girl
'Cause she's talking it and she needs to quit

And she wilding out, what she talkin' 'bout?
Let me tell you now, this girl, she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Why are you trying, trying to lie, girl?
When I ain't never met you at all
Saying goodbye, but how could ya
You do this, you prove this
Your foolness, seduces
Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby (No), that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby (No), she ain't my girl

Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh

Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' a Monte Carlo?

See them heat waves in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?

Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?

Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh

What are you willing to do to stay together? ('Gether)
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother? (Brrr-brrr)
Girl, you're killin' me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this (Fix it, fix it)
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally, but I can't buy your love

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around

Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

And never go away? (Hey, hey, hey)

Girl, you say that you don't wanna talk (You say), but it's cool
I've been thinkin' 'bout you all day long, hopin' you pick up your phone
Girl, I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh, baby (Oh, baby), oh, baby

Oh, girl, I got a secret place that we can go (Secret place that we can go)
'Cause I really wanna be alone (I really wanna be alone)
And, baby, nobody else gotta know (Nobody, yeah)
Just meet me later on the low (Won't you meet me on the low, girl?)
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause, girl, my heart's breaking (Heartbreaker)
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker (Ooh, babe)
'Cause, girl, my heart's breaking (Heart is breaking, ooh, whoa)

So what I'm really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk with everyone being around but
It's just personal, this just for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you (Girl, you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool)
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes, love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm callin' your name (Girl, I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh, baby)
And you know I don't wanna lose that, 'cause I still believe in us

I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see
'Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak, I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to you
And if I had the world in my hands, I'd give it all to you
I wanna know if you feel it the way that I feel it
I wanna know if you feel it the way that I, the way that I

And you taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart, with your heart

I tried to scare you, scare you away
Showed you the door, you adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of mind

Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
Never judged, never judged, never judged me when I was unable

Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me when I was unstable

Not every wound is the kind that bleeds, uh, uh
Never know when my mind's gonna turn on me (Never know)

These memories have been toxic (Oh)

Oh, I know God was listening

You're an angel watchin' over me (Oh)

Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere

Maybe I stare too much, maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
But when you let down your hair, dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm supposed to be

Say, "I love you" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months and that's too much

Love the way you love your mom and take on all your friends' problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh
I still relive that second, I met my biggest blessin'
Prayed for you, look what God has done

Say, "I love you" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much

Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again

Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through

Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever

I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?

Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home

I had a notion
Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky
Oh my

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
But we're the blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
(Woah, woah, woah)
If I had the chance
If I had the chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

There repercussion
Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you


If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing, oh

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself

Anything's possible since you made my heart melt

Feels like time's moving in slow motion
Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I don't go looney over you (Ooh-ooh)
Just trying to amplify the sound
To drown out all of this need for you (You, ooh)
Biting my nails, got me nervous, so anxious
See it's one o'clock now
Noon felt like three hours ago

I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A.​
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like, "Where you been?"
Love me like you don't want it to end

I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A.​
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

Before you gotta go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Before you gotta go
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location
Thank you, yes, you're less than five minutes away from me
In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna be

When I'm in my thoughts sometimes
It's hard to believe I'm the person you think I am
The person that you tell me you love
I'm on my ten thousandth life
Nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine slipped my hands
But this the one I'm not givin' up

Night after night you fall asleep on me
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was

I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (Tonight)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (Tonight)
It's in the things that you show me (Show me)
I need you, don't let me go, need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de–, I don't de–, I don't deserve you tonight

I can tend to hold things back
I need you more than I let you believe I do
'Cause you could think it might be too much, oh, yeah

Oh, when we kiss, I'm alive and I feel brand new
There's nothin' that I want more than us (Na-na-na-na-na)

And when you give in to me, I'm so high, but I'm fallin' (Na-na-na)
And now my eyes are locked on you (Yeah), as you dance around the room (Yeah)
And finally, I'm right where I belong (Oh)

Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know it's hard to be asleep at night

Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
For you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you

And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I'll just stay right here
I know that you want me too
Baby, we can make it through anything

Cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be alright

Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face, and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand

Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
Cause I know that a piece of you’s gone, every time you done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can’t fly unless you let yourself fall

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
What's gonna make you fall in love? (in love)
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all (don't have to be scared, don't have to be scared)
Oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me

First, I'll acknowledge, our trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah-woah, woah

I'm missing your good intentions, I'm missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem, know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it don't pay to lie, costs more to see you cry
Saying nothing gets you nowhere fast, no more holding back inside
Well, now that I'm back around you, nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same

First, I'll acknowledge, our trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah-woah, woah

Going through old emotions, tryna find a reason
Why we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect, we'll be changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say
If it's going to sleep alone at night, I don't wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give, no more holding back this time
Now that I'm back around you, nothing around me matters
Hope you feel the same

First, I'll acknowledge, our trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right (Make it right, make it right), make it right (Make it right, make it right)
Make it right (Make it right, make it right), this time I'll do you right, woah-woah, woah

You know I'ma do you right

Somе people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But, baby, you are a lifetime

Oh, darlin', there's no word that can describe
The way that I feel, tonight
Oh, darlin', I would walk that broken road
Time and time again if it led me to your hello

You are my everything, I'd give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow, every kiss is woah
They say you know when you know, well, I know, I know you're the one

Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I learned, it wasn't my turn, it wasn't the right time
Some people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But, baby, you are a lifetime

Baby, you are a lifetime

Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now
Ain't no need in being so anxious
I can hear your heart beating out loud

Quit acting like we're in a race
Beggin' me, you know I'm on the way over
Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward, no pressure

And we got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
We got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home
We got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives

So quick to move forward, no pressure

Don’t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don’t wanna be left with the question, why?
Let’s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?

Sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye

They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don’t wanna see us together now

Some people separate, yeah
Don’t think we should separate
When we both adore one another
You’re a dream come true
We should start over brand new

From the beginning, it was ending
We were emotionally pending
Jeopardy, second guessing
Got all the questions to my answers

Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

Wednesday
It feel like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
You just said, "Hello," I lost my sanity
Thought you was lookin' through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over
Look out, watch out, got me on the defense
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

Better that than turnin' into nothing (Way-oh, way-oh)
Ain't no interruptin' this eruption (Way-oh, way-oh)

LD, uh
I believe in love
Girl, you got my hopes all up
When I left you, when I met you
I called mom and told her 'bout it
I got all up on your IG and was scrollin' down for hours
I got back to 2015 and you started lookin' young, so I stopped (Ooh)
Post intercourse when you walk by (Ass, ass, ass)
More buns than a Shop Rite (Woah)
And you wanna sleep over my crib?
Let me go and get you a soft t-shirt, here (Soft tee)
What are our kids gonna be like? (Hmm)
What is your skin routine like?
Girl, just run around bed with me
I'll flirt with you all cleverly
I'll lock you down, Pat Beverley
I'll kiss your breasts all tenderly, what's up? (Breast)
How you so hot and cute? (How?)
I wanna make a language up with you
You're already drivin' me crazy, so just

Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

Better that than turnin' into nothing  (Way-oh, way-oh)

I told you I'mma make it, that commitment
Yeah, you took your shot and didn't miss it
Ain't nothing more attractive than ambition

Lately, you've been busy, wondering if you miss me
Why did you go against me? I just wanna know
How come you act so different? Talk to me, I'll listen
All the love I'm giving, don't act like you don't know

I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

Girl, you always catch me at the bad time (Bad time)
When I know you probably think it's a lie (A lie)

Hard breathing, what is it I'm not seeing?
She said she's leaving, damn, I can't believe it
It's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me
Shut my heart down, and I don't know what I'ma do now

I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care

Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times
The times you got back up, woah
Could be a billionaire in a year
That's how you gotta think 'til you're there
On the regular

If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning
Love is a component
You’re the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Come again each time
'Til the water runs dry
Oh don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

Oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

If I had a guitar missing 5 strings
A guitar with only one string
I could only play one song, ooh
A simple melody
Simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing
You know what I mean

If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning
Love is a component
You're the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Come again each time
'Til the water runs dry
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

Oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All in it, all in it

See, growing up, I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And, and maybe if I was good at something that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that I wasn't gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because people aren't perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God it's like he's perfect
And he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition

[Song 68: Drummer Boy]
37 ContributorsDrummer Boy LyricsTrack of pop sensation Justin Bieber’s second studio album Under the Mistletoe featuring rapper Busta Rhymes.
Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum
Yeah, I'm on the drum, yeah, I'm on the snare drum
Yeah, I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat 'cause I'm playing for the Son
Playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time, so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know
I'm still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
I'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it

Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum (Yeah)
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
(Let's gather 'round the mistletoe real quick)
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
(Matter fact, let's gather 'round the fireplace, it's about to get hot in here)
Nothing to give our king (Bieber, what up?), pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
(I'ma needa get straight to it)

Yo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back, despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter", I said "Cool"
You know I'ma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah

Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe

I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

It’s been 72 hours since the crash
A fiery ball come clashing from the sky
Reports still show no known survivors
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
Extraterrestrials
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens

You said “I come in peace” so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen

Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet’s outside there waiting
I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn’t have a friend, didn’t know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You’re my best friend please listen to me

You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen

Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet’s outside there waiting
I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

Greetings, I fell from the sky
I’m from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And our flying saucer crashed, I’m the only one that survived
I’ve only taken over this planet since I arrived
I’m in a backpack, I’m ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I’m an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne’s world

Reports from witnesses flooded into the police station
Sounds like something out of a movie
After 
First of all the object is lying here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
UFO 
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
We found this but no one can identify it
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens

Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet’s outside there waiting
I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

In our planet we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted
It's a gift from the mother and
In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace

Hurry up and get here now, but don't speed
I'll never get over you up under me

I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
Oh, yes, I am (Yeah-yeah)
I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
Yeah, for you, I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
I'm available

Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)

I get frustrated when you're busy
Lately, that's been more than often, baby, what is this?
It's like, do you even miss me?
Feelin' less than priority, you got me convinced
Convinced I'm the only one, trippin' in my head
Because in reality, you live in my bed
I'm supposed to hold onto everything you said
Yes or no question, don't leave it unread

Are you available (Yeah-yeah) now?
Oh, here I am, (Yeah-yeah) oh, here I am
Are you available? (Yeah-yeah)
Just tell me, "Yeah"
'Cause for you, I am
You know I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
Are you available (Yeah-yeah)
Like I'm available?

Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)

You that New York time, easy Sunday morning (Front seat)
When we touch, I think we skip a beat (Beep, beep, beep)
It's a movie with you, got me at the edge (Let me see)

There’s beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss, I'm not used to this
There's nothin’ I won't give
Don't like makin' promises, just remember this

You'rе the fruit of my life
That patient kind, that tongue got me tongue-tied
And that's why I will love you different
Just the way you are

No matter how different, you’re beautiful

Fenty, want you on the cover, undercovers ain’t no rubbers
On this planet, I'll treat you like a mother, let's make babies

There's beauty on your lips

Don't like makin' promises

Even when the fire burnin', I need you fi di light
It's a different night with you right by my side
You mix the color, color, color, color, see the future bright

Ooh, and you can trust me
After all the lies I told you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Don't nobody else deserve my time

I reach out to you, but my hands can't hold enough
Enough of your greatness
You teach me patience

Never understood what it meant
It meant to submit to love
So beyond what lust is
Hey, it's a blessing that you're in my life
Make me look even better
When we shine, we shine together

Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Don't nobody else deserve my eyes

When you demand my presence, it's hard to read the message
I stay on the defense to take away your leverage
'Til you put it in perspective
Can't help but to respect it
Oh, now I know what love is
I know what true love is
Yeah, down in my soul
Far more than you know
My self-esteem gets low
You lift it right up through the ceiling, woah

Open up to me, it's all you gotta do
Give me all your heart, I'll swap mine out with you
Swap it out with you, swap it out with you
You come into my world, I'll give my world to you
We can swap, swap, swap it out

I can show you what I'm talking 'bout
Be obliged just to show you how
Follow my lead, that's what you oughta do
No pressure
Swapping out ain't ever been a crime
If it was then I'd do the time
Throw away the keys as long as I'm here with you
Forever

Eye for an eye
Remember when I told you
"Wipe your pretty eyes, dry 'em on my shoulder"?
You ain't gotta try, try to get closer
50/50 deal, let's make a deposit
Simulate the love, try it 'fore you knock it
You ain't gotta rush, but you ain't gotta stop it

Open up to me, it's all you gotta do
Give me all your heart, I'll swap mine out with you
Swap it out with you, swap it out with you
You come into my world, I'll give my world to you
We can swap, swap, swap it out

Oh, swappin' out will only change your life
But it's worth it, the sacrifice
After all, what do we have to lose? Nothing
Don't separate our destiny
By separating you from me
These are the terms that were made for each other, woah, oh

Ooh, eye for an eye
Remember when I told you
"Wipe your pretty eyes, dry 'em on my shoulder"?
You ain't gotta try, try to get closer

Simulate the love, try it 'fore you knock it
You ain't gotta rush, but you ain't gotta stop it (You ain't gotta stop it)

Open up to me, it's all you gotta do (It's all you gotta do)
Give me all your heart (Give me all your heart), I'll swap mine out with you (Right now)

Nobody else would be forgiving
Cause of all the love that you give me

Nobody else would be forgiving

What up JB? It's time to go to the club
Time to pull those toys out man skrr

Hey where the party at? Let's go, let's ride, Let's roll
Yeah, everywhere I go them girls follow, na, na, na, na
Let everybody know that I'm here tonight, as soon as I walk in the door
Hey, pretty lady I think I need you in my life, in fact I know I need you for sure

Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name? Happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose
Looking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you

Is it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop

I got money in my pocket and I ain't afraid to spend it
Ain't a problem baby girl, when you’re winning
Tell me what you wanna do, we can make a move now
Girl you ain't gotta fight the feelin', tell me why you grinning
I think you're likin' what I'm sayin'
Do I really gotta say any more?
You need to know that I ain't playin'
Baby what are we waitin' for?

Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again

I'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose
Looking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you

Is it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop

Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 PTs (lean!)
I asked her what's her name, got to know she said Hannah
On the way to the mansion, said she loved the Panamera
In the trap with J. Bieber with my phone chirpin' like beepers
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae is in the pot when I beat her
Take her 'cross the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him

Yeen never seen a nigga like me
Hopping out, Giussepe steppin' with a mink, gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in a V12 Hummer with the leather seats
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I think they watchin' me
I'm a vegetarian
All I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly
Yo bitch call me call me "Your Majesty"

My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I watch her like a telescope
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch, she watchin' me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and I'm rich, ridin' in a Phantom Ghost
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo

Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name? Happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose
Looking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you

Is it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop

Two big-face Rollies, no, I ain't lyin'
Making momma so proud that she cryin'
Yeah, you say I'm crazy? Guess that makes two
But I never knew that dreams really came true
Started playing drums when I was only two
Now we kick it in Japan, kung-fu
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating
I swear Otis Redding will be oh-so ready
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with Kenny
And we steady getting many, I mean money
Riding in an all-black Benz with the all-black rims
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses

Wait, I'm not done

I thanked Jesus at the awards, I'm never going to hell
Call me Zack Morris, I'm saving you by the bell
My girl says I'm perfect, she just loves an imperfect person perfectly
Personally, I think she is perfectly perfect
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me
I swear I got a hundred of these 'cause baby, I'm a money tree
So be my little honey, be my little-bitty bunny
I got honeys all up on me, baby, I just get it done-y
Possibly, you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible
And logically, well probably, but you just take me lyrically
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally
There's a bigger me inside this little me screaming out
I should make history, I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me
Run up on my enemies, see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me, I wipe away their memory
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
I ain't even notice, but my focus on my photos
Might be bogus, no, they shouldn't be a photoshoot
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time
Playing with camera claiming that it's not mine
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah, without them, I'd be blurry

Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why
I'm alone, alone, alone

And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world we set in stone

I love you, need you
Need you here to stay

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else? If you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else? If you wanna be my baby

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Is this what you want? The baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, had to have it
I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?

All of your boundaries keep me in line
God is within us, what you're always sayin'
Your energy is enough to suffice

Your intentions are obvious
Your affection's miraculous
Every promise you make, you keep
Never met nobody else like this, only angels speak like this

Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips, only angels speak like this

La-di-da, da-da-di-da, la-di-da, la-di-da
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, di-da, la-da
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, di-da, da-da
Only angels speak like this

The cadence you speak, it keeps us both in sync
The ocean we lay in makes it hard to think (Ooh)
Our spirits combine and it's a basic instinct
Your love is free-spoken, not written in ink (Ooh-woah)

Your intentions are obvious (Obvious)
Your affection's miraculous (I cherish your touch)
Every promise you make, you keep (Ooh)
Never met nobody else like this, only angels speak like this

Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake (I'm wide awake)
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate (How they resonate)
You say that no matter what (No matter what), you're watchin' over me (You're watchin' over me)
I knew when I first read your lips (Your lips), only angels speak like this (Like this)

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us, and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart

So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth

And mommy, you were always somewhere
And daddy, I live out of town
So tell me, how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me, why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away and now I just need you here

So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth

Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go?
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us

Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?

The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest, the star of my show
So many times I wished you'd be the one for me
But never knew you'd get like this, girl
What'd you do to me?

You're who I'm thinking of
And girl, you ain't my runner-up
And no matter what, you're always number one

My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you

My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl

You're used to going out your way to impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself with me
I'll take you as you are
I know they said believe in love
It's a dream that can't be real
So girl, let's write a fairytale and show 'em how we feel

You're who I'm thinking of
And girl, you ain't my runner-up

29 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolAt Least For Now Lyrics
I'm concerned when you look at my face
You're excited for no reason
I look lost with a drink in my hand
What you think is fair ain't even even
It's cold outside from my expression
Take the scarf and wrap it around my neck
Loosen up my tie

At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now
One finger at a time, I turn the pages, yeah

Right leg crossed while you're smokin' a cigarette
Camera's on the couch, ain't nobody takin' pictures
Throw my arms around you, bear witness
The stripes on my shirt, can you read between the lines?
You sip champagne while I sip on red wine
Never mind me watchin' you, never mind the tension
Please excuse me while I dance, I forgot to mention
I'm going on strike

At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
At least for now, at least for now, oh

36 ContributorsBelieve Lyrics
Believe, believe, believe, believe

I don't know how I got here, uh
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?
Believe

There were days when I was just broken
You know, there were nights when I was doubting myself
But you kept my heart from folding

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?
Believe

Where would I be, if you
If you didn't believe
Wouldn't know, how it feels, to touch the sky
If you didn't believe, believe, believe

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?

Where would I be if you, yeah, if you didn't believe?
Wouldn't know how it feels to touch the sky, yeah

Sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me
I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be?
Could this be happening to me? Yeah
We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by?
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?

Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now it's time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Catching feelings, girl
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)

I'm good alone, but with you, I'm better
I just wanna see you smile (See you smile)
Just say the word and I'll be right there (Be right there)
I ain't never goin' nowhere
I'm just tryna see where this can take us
'Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her, yeah

Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up

Should I tell her how I really feel? (How I really feel)
Or should I move in closer? Just be still? (How will I know?)
'Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand, will everything change?
How do I know if she feels the same? Whoa, ooh-ooh

Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up (What's up?)

It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying, soldiers are dying, some people don't have a home

But I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite (Can't eat, can't eat)
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner, 'cause of my dinner, still there on my plate?
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference, and it's starting today

'Cause I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray (And I pray)
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

I pray for the brokenhearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need, I pray
Can you give 'em one today?

I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

I pray

I close my eyes and pray

You can take it out on me

Sometimes I don't mind you havin' the worst day
Oh, no, I don't
All the stress turns into built-up energy
Yes, it does
On the edge, I'm your net, go on and fall back
Easy on that pressure point, I love to push that
Let your frustrations out right here
I'm your psychiatrist, let's talk about it
We can use sign language, I know your body
I see the weight weighin' on your shoulders
It's so heavy
Let me be the meaning of your composure
Oh, oh

You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might
And get it all out 'til you feel light
And take it out on me
You can take it out on me

Yeah, I'm your plug
Whatever you need, I'll make sure you get enough
And when your battery gets low
I'ma be the one to charge you up
Let me massage your mental and your physical
Whenever you lose doubt, I'll be your miracle
When you're around me, you should feel invincible
Please don't forget that

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing
That's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying
Oh lord

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken
Yes I did
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping
Can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turn to moping
Tell me...

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
I need you the most

[Song 111: Love Me Like You Do]
33 ContributorsLove Me Like You Do LyricsNot to be confused with Ellie Goulding’s song of the same name, JB’s “Love Me Like You Do” is more of a love-based ode to a significant other. However, it’s not completely sex-free, either.
Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby, teach me, teach me, teach me
Show me, show me, show me the way to your heart
Ooh, my baby, baby, I'm begging, lady, lady
Put me in the middle, that's where I'mma start, uh huh

I like how your eyes complementing you hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
Our bodies touching while you

Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby, will let me, let me, let me
Let me, let me, let me, be all you your desire
Pretty baby, baby, I'm begging lady, lady
Take me to the top now and I'll take you higher

I like how your eyes complementing you hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
Kissing on your neck while you

Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

Alright, okay
Right there, my way
Cause when you love me, I can feel it
When your heart beats, I can hear it
Be quiet, don't say a word
Don't say nothing, girl, I'm all yours
Love me like you do but let me go first
Listen to these words right here

Love me like you do, love me like it's new
Love me like you love me, like there's nothing left to lose
We'll hop up in the Benz, if you're tryna cruise
Hop up in them bed, baby, if you're trying to snooze
Louis V. shoes, look at me do it
Got a lot of secrets, baby, can you guess clues?
And if you had a choice I know what'd you choose
You'd choose me, right?

Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

27 ContributorsStuck In the Moment Lyrics
With you, with you
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place

Now, Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two (Who knew?)
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do)
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
There might be something real between us two (Who knew?)
Now we don't wanna fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do)
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

You see, like, just because this cold, cruel world saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't want to be so old and grey, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (And space)
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Yeah

But no, not today
Won't leave 'til I find what I'm looking for
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do
Is dance under the moon

'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby, give it to me
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need tonight

Your love is like a roller coaster
The way that you take my breath away
It feels like I'm slowly falling
Deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper

'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby, give it to me
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need tonight
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need tonight

[Song 123: She Don’t Like the Lights]
21 ContributorsShe Don’t Like the Lights LyricsThis song is on Justin’s 5th studio album. It’s about his, now ex girlfriend, Selena Gomez and how she didn’t like all of the fame and attention the pair was getting.
She don't like the flash
Wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame
Hate it when we're miles apart

And she getting to the point where it's too much for her
Gonna throw us all away cause it's too much for her
She can't hide away, cause the world knows who we are

She don't like the lights, whoah
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights, whoah
She don't, she don't, she don't
Don't wanna share with no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera
She don't like the lights, whoah
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights, whoah

Now she's giving ultimatums
She don't like this life
She said if I loved her
I'd give it up, won't think twice
I can't do that

And it's getting to the point where it's too much for her
Wanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for
She don't wanna live this life
Damn, that's why I love her

She don't like the lights, whoah
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights, whoah
She don't, she don't, she don't
Don't wanna share with no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera
She don't like the lights, whoah
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights

How can I choose between the two, when all the lights are all I know?
I wish she could see how good this can be
I hope that she waits a little bit longer
Cause I don't wanna live life without her by my side
Cause she gives the light that's in me
But she don't know whoah, she don't know whoah

She don't like the lights
The lights
The lights, the lights whoah
She don't like the lights whoah
She don't like the lights, no
She don't like the lights

28 ContributorsWhere Do I Fit In Lyrics
When the day is over and those thoughts set in
That's when I start to wonder, where do I fit in?
But then You remind me that You're holdin' me tight
You say the past is behind me and it'll be alright

And You say to me, "It'll be alright"
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
When I'm all alone and fear is all I see
Sittin' in the silence with these insecurities
And then You remind me, You're holdin' me tight
And You love me completely, You're always by my side

And You say to me, it'll be alright
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

I know You're not a God out there hidin' on mountains, oh, no
You come right where I am, lost my way, but You found me
Like a ray in the dark, on my ugliest days
You say that You'll always love me just the same
And then You remind me that You're holdin' me tight
You said the past is behind me and it will be alright

Oh, and You say to me it'll be alright
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Gonna be alright, gonna be alright
It will, it will be alright

I hear those words over and over, "It'll be alright"
Go to sleep, My child, it'll be alright
Sleep soundly, My child, it'll be alright
I'm right here, My child, it'll be alright
I won't go anywhere, it'll be alright
You're in the palm of My hand, it'll be alright
My arms are wrapped around you, it'll be alright
While you sleep, I watch over you, it'll be alright
I'll take care of your loved ones, it'll be alright
Your future's in My hands, it'll be alright
Your past is forgiven, it'll be alright
Your future is secure, it'll be alright
I forgive you, it'll be alright
I'm your friend that's closer than a brother, it'll be alright
Sleep now for when the morning comes
My mercies will be new, it'll be alright (Hallelujah)

Girl, I've been fooled by your smile

We let it stray for a while, yeah
Looks so deceiving, you convinced me, yeah

So clear to me now
Can't explain what you're doing to me, yeah, aye
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time, but I'll figure it out
Why should we fight the feeling?

Though it's infatuation

I'm in love with the thought of you
Not the things you do, but the thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Love with the thought of you

I fell victim to your style
It's so amazing, girl, you're in your own league
Rather be stuck in denial, yeah
Then tryna be without you girl, girl, girl, girl

[Song 126: We’re In This Together]
44 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschWe’re In This Together Lyrics
Yeah, it's not easy growin' up
You know, mm

Only two years old, I was playin' drums on the table
Guess I knew it was the only thing stable
When I was young, I could pick things up quick
Anything that I did, I was pretty good at it
Well, I started school, I was a troublemaker
Thought I knew everything in life, yeah, that caught up to me later, hehe
I had to learn about humility
I had to grow up and accept responsibility, yeah
That wasn't easy 'cause at seventeen, I had a milli'
Women throwin' themselves at me had me goin' silly
On the surface, I felt like thе man
But deep inside I felt deprivеd just like an empty can

I've had everything in life that people strive for (Strive for)
Just to ask the question, "What are we alive for?" (Alive for)
What you believe? And would you agree? Well, what would you die for? (Die for)
Is there a reason? What is the meanin'? What do we cry for?

One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh-oh-oh
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh-oh-oh, we're in this together

I moved out when I was eighteen
I was livin' in a mansion doin' big things
FBI raided my house and shit was gettin' dicey
I was doin' stupid shit to get people to like me
All that to say, I'm thankful that's not who I am
And I'm thankful God was with me when shit hit the fan
'Cause He's the reason that I'm still standin'
And even in a pandemic, God is still plannin'
Plannin' peace, plannin' joy, plan another day
Gave His life upon the cross to wash our sins away

I've had everything in life that people strive for
Just to ask the question, "What are we alive for?"
What you believe? And would you agree? Well, what would you die for?
Is there a reason? What is the meanin'? What do we cry for?

One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh-oh-oh
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh-oh-oh, we're in this together

I pray for every single person listening to this song right now
I pray for peace, I pray for joy, I pray for confidence, I pray for reassurance
I thank you so much for the person listening to this right now
I pray that You would bless them
Bless their mind, bless their finances
Bless their family, bless their sons, bless their daughters, bless their moms, bless their dads, bless their grandparents
God, I just pray for an overwhelming sense of Your presence in their home right now
An overwhelming sense of Your peace that says, "Everything is going to be all right."
In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus

[Song 127: All She Wrote]
40 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschAll She Wrote Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We reject what we don't understand
We turn our backs on a fellow man
I wanna change, but my heart is bleedin'
Heart is hard, and can't nobody see me
I wanna be there for the ones that need me
I can't stand the pain I see on TV
Jealous 'cause they wanna be me
Damn it, man, this life ain't easy
It takes over me
My unforgiveness keeps control of mе
Damn it, I gotta get a hold of me
Gotta get a hold of mе, oh
What you want out of life? That's the question
This ain't a simulation, it's a blessin'
Is it a mistake or is it destined?
We ain't got no time for second-guessin'
We can't save ourselves, we need a savior
We ain't make ourselves, we need a maker
I keep failin' myself, I need somethin' new
So I lay my life down, I give it all to You

All to You, give it all to You (I give it all to You)
Give it all to You, give it all (I give it all to You), oh-oh

I came to the end of me, believin' the enemy
Comin' with that "Mmm," man, you ain't a friend of me
Nothin' can fix that, ooh, not even the Hennessy
I had to switch it up, yeah, switch up the remedy
God, can You use imperfect people? (Oh)
'Cause I'm broken through and through (Oh)
Just tell me where I need to go (Need to go)
'Cause that's all that I wanna do (All that I wanna do)
I'm a mess, but I'm tryna grow
I'm upset, but I still wanna know
Is there more for my life or is that all she wrote? (Is that all she wrote?)

Uh, is that all she wrote? (Is that all that she wrote?)
Is that all she wrote? (Is that all that she wrote?)
Is that all she wrote?

Thanks to all them Judas kisses, I got a master's in forgiveness
I don't need a jail system, I walk in conviction
I'd rather pray to God than pray for wishes
I'm supernatural, not superstitious, there's a difference
Like relationship versus religion, that's a prison
I'm lightin' circle, then royal purple inside a prism
This flow is so universal, it came with dreams and visions
I got the keys to the kingdom, I'm 'bout my Father business
I came up straight from the bottom, I started from the finish
You can't undermine a mastermind
I may be out of your mind, but I ain't out of mine
I'm co-crucified, bury, resurrected
And perfected in the Son of God
Just like water turn to wine, I'm a prophetic sign
Ask your barber, I'm a headliner in New York Times
My life verses, I am His, yeah, and He is mine
The great "I Am"'s, the greatest Lamb of all time
Rebranded, redesigned and redefined
From Brandon to brand new, I'ma brand name in the household, brand too
Who are you to try to tell me what I can't do? We need a pull, huh?

You ever ask yourself, "Am I gonna make it?"
Well, I don't know, of course I can fake it
But honestly, can I go wrong?
I'm so tired, I'm so broken, I'm so weary
Oh, God, oh, God

You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
Warm me up, with your Christmas love

Hey angel in the snow, I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one, you're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year, my present is standin' right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love, yeah

Like a beautiful tree, you can light up the room
But your kind of a star can't be removed
Like a beautiful carol, I get lost in your song
And I will forever sing along

So deck the halls and all the rest

Your love's enough to wash it all away

On the third day, yeah, You rose up and You beat death once and for all (Once and for all)

Sometimes this world is feeling crazy
At times my mind is feeling hazy
But, Lord, You always come and save me
God Almighty, my safety
You're my end, You're my new beginning
You're my home, the One I confide in
You're the very air I breathe
The reason that I sing
Oh, I've tried it all
Nothing could fix the damage in my heart
'Til I met Your love
Oh, You gave Your life so I won't fall apart

On the third day, yeah, You rose up and You beat death once and for all (Once and for all)

Why? Why is there nobody like Jesus?
Hasn't billions of men and women lived on this planet?
But why, why are we convinced there's nobody like Jesus?
Was He not merely a teacher, a prophet
An exegeter, an explainer and yet we find ourselves in history wondering
"Is there anyone like Jesus? Who is this Jesus?"
This Man from the Middle East who claims to be God
Is He God? Is He sinless? Is He perfection?
Is He the once and for all sacrifice for humanity?
Is He a man without fear?
Did He become sin so that you and I might become right in our relationship with God?
Is there nobody like Jesus?
Did He die between two criminals on the crucifixion?
Three days later, did He rise again as the grave empty?
Has He defeated death, Hell in the grave and sin itself?
If so, there is nobody like Jesus (Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus)

We were inseparable
Everything I had to do, I did it next to you
And the memories we made were so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule

There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
Ooh you got used to being on your own

I saw it happening
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could have divided my time, I should have rationed it

There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
Ooh you got used to being on your own

I'm afraid to say the wrong thing
Criticized from every angle
And I'm afraid to lay it on the line
And selfishly, I wanna hold back

Do we got the room to make mistakes?
Are we judged for everything we say? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I wanna grow, but I'm afraid (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
And will it always be the same? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Does what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is life about climbin' up the ladder?
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writin' 'em off is not the answer
Do we got the room to make mistakes? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, do we?)
Are we judged for everything we say? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, are we?)

Even in our darkest days, even when we least deserve it
Even when we're doing that stupid thing we wish we weren't doing, God never writes us off, ever
He's with us in our pain, He's with us in our struggle
He's with us in our bad decisions
He's with us all the time, He never writes us off (He never writes us off)

You formed the whole of me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh), inward and out (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
I am awesomely and wonderfully created (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)

You skillfully designed me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh), You saw the essence of me before I was formed
Before I existed, all of my days were written in your book Psalms 139:13-16

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun in my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl

Out of all the things in life
That I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, woah

I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Before your love was low, playing girls was my high
You changed the game, now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah

Out of all things in life
That I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, here, here, yeah

I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation

Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I can't imagine life without your touch
And every kiss that you give, you fill me up
And through all the heart aching, jealous females hating
I'mma hold it down for you, you
Oh, woah, oh, you're the common denominator
Oh, yeah, whoa, I don't want to go back

I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart

And girl I'll be your biggest crush
When I walk up in the room

Girl I'm faithful
You know I'm faithful
Everyday you’re wondering
Asking me who was I with and where I been
Write 'em all
'Cause baby I am leaving
Don't get it wrong 'cause I trust you and I love you and it's a new season

I'm moving on, I'm moving on
You made a promise
Girl at least I'm honest
'Cause I'm faithful
Faithful yeah
'Cause I'm faithful
I don't want to hurt your heart
But I told you from the start
Girl I'm faithful
You know I'm faithful
Yeah
Yeah

Crying up above, I'm just here to take you away
(You away, you away)
Don't worry 'bout a thing, I'm just focused on you today
(You today, yeah, oh)

You're laid out, you were raised up in a poor town
Roll up, baby, roll up
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now
Paris and London (On top of the world)
Baby, we're so down (Will you be my girl?)
Something I wanna say
Yeah, you know I'll be there

I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart

I see my phone ring, hope it's you, babe
You sent me a picture
Well, I sent one too
I'm just tryna keep this love on track
Oh babe, I got your heart and I won't give it back

You're laid out, you were raised up in a poor town
Roll up, baby, roll up
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now
Paris and London (On top of the world)
Baby, we're so down (Will you be my girl?)
Something I wanna say

I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart

Holding you close to my heart, uh, yeah
So I'm laid back in the Maybach
Damn, these seats go way back
I was thinking about way back
When we used to say that
I was yours, you were mine
And we fought to pass the time
And I realized, I realized, that we
(Babe) No matter what
(Babe) No matter what
(Babe) No matter what (Oh)
Babe, babe, babe, yeah, yeah

I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart

[Song 148: First Dance]
27 ContributorsFirst Dance Lyrics
It's your chance take her hand to the floor
Fellas just the moment you've been waiting for
Girl if you see something you like then let them know
Ladies I know you’re ready
Because you only got one chance, yeah yeah
For your first dance, you never forget about your first dance
So, take advantage of the slow jam
Tell them J.B., yeah, man

When I close my eyes, I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long for this day to come
Now that it's here, let's make it special
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, ain't no chaperones
This could be the night of your dreams

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, now we're all alone
Here's the opportunity

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says that we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

It's your chance take her hand to the floor, to the floor
Girl, if you see something you like then let them know
Because you only got one chance, for your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah man

If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Hey what’s up guys this is Justin Bieber
And this is the best DJ in the whole world
His name is DJ Tay James, he’s kinda cool
And you’re now tuning in to the We Know The DJ Radio

Black rims, black body
Bad girls, you should act naughty
Oh that's your girl I met in the lobby?
If you're in my section baby girl you here to party
VIP, you know it boy
Make a milli at the show, just to throw it boy
Said this goes out to all the haters
I'm a young Tunechi, kicking it with pro skaters
Oh my goodness, why you wearing two rollies?
I got time and I got money and I got girls like it’s not funny
Honey, honey, what you want from me?
C'mon bunny my-my bunny, my playboy bunny, honey
I open the door, walk in the store
She sees it’s me she says “Hello”
I say “What's good?” she says “Let's go”
So took her home, TKO

Black rims, black body
Bad girls, you should act naughty
Oh, that’s your girl on my Ducati?
If you're in my section baby girl you here to party
Never did I, think that I would get here
Now you know I'm flying on the jet here
Momma said remember don’t forget dear
So ahead of everybody you the best here
Black rims, black body
Bad girls, you should get naughty
Oh, that’s your girl I met in the lobby?
If you’re in my section girl you here to party

[Song 150: Bigger]
23 ContributorsBigger LyricsTrack off Canadian pop star Justin Bieber’s debut EP My World in 2009. This song was written by Frank Ocean.
Mafia
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger, big

Gotta believe in me (Gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't, ever, ever let you down (No)
Like a seesaw let you down (Oh)
You know why?
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger) I'm bigger (Hey, hey)
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

Remember when my heart was young?
It was still bigger than me (Still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would've got rid of me (Hey)
Now the bullies in the schoolyard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us (No)
Because we ain't pushovers, no more, baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger (Hey) I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

Remember those stone washed jeans (I remember that)
Don't knock your earrings (Like yesterday)
They shined on me (We were little then)
In class daydreaming of you (My baby)
(Just remember) You, wow wow
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger
It's gone out of control

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (Bigger)
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small (so small) from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger (Our love's bigger)
I'm bigger (I'm bigger) and you're bigger (you're bigger), hey hey, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, (I’m bigger) I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger (I ain’t small no more) and you're bigger, woah
