I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you

(Help me) I broke apart my insides
(Help me) I've got no soul to sell
(Help me) The only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself

I want to fuck you like an animal
I want to feel you from the inside
I want to fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God
You can have my isolation
You can have the hate that it brings
You can have my absence of faith
You can have my everything

(Help me) You tear down my reason
(Help me) It's your sex I can smell
(Help me) You make me perfect
Help me become somebody else

I want to fuck you like an animal
I want to feel you from the inside
I want to  fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God

Through every forest, above the trees
Within my stomach, scraped off my knees
I drink the honey inside your hive
You are the reason, I stay alive

She spreads herself wide open to let the insects in
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been

My disease, my infection
I am so impure, oh

Give it

Devils speak of the way in which she'll manifest
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
Need to contaminate, to alleviate this loneliness
I now know the depths I reach are limitless
Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure

Oh

This is the first day of my last days
I built it up, now I take it apart
Climbed up real high, now fall down real far
No need for me to stay
The last thing left, I just threw it away
I put my faith in God and my trust in you
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do

Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you

I'm the one without a soul
I'm the one with this big fucking hole
No new tale to tell
Twenty-six years, on my way to hell
Gotta listen to your big-time, hard-line, bad luck, fist-fuck
Don't think you're having all the fun
You know me, I hate everyone

Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you

I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to, but I can't turn back
I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to, but I can't turn back

Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real

Don't like the look of it
Don't like the taste of it
Don't like the smell of it
I want to watch it come down
All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?

Shove it up inside, surprise, lies
Stains like the blood on your teeth
Bite, chew, suck
(Away the tender parts)

I want to break it up
I want to smash it up
I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down
Maybe afraid of it
Let's discredit it
Let's pick away at it
I want to watch it come down

All the pigs are all lined up

Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?

The pigs have won tonight
Now they can all sleep soundly

Didn't you? Didn't you?
You believed in all your lies
Didn't you? Didn't you?

The ruiner's got a lot to prove
He's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe
The ruiner's your only friend
Well, he's the living end to the cattle he deceives
The raping of the innocent
You know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
Now the only pure thing left
In my fucking world is wearing your disease
How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd it get so hard?
How'd it get so long?

You had to give them all a sign
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You had to covet what was mine
Didn't you? Didn't you?

The ruiner's a collector
He's an infector serving his shit to his flies
Maybe there will come a day
When those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
Maybe it's a part of me you took
To a place I hoped it would never go
And maybe that fucked me up
Much more than you'll ever know

How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd you get so hard?
How'd it get so long?
And what you gave to me
My perfect ring of scars
You know I can see
What you really are

You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now

He tries to tell me what I put inside of me

God is dead, and no one cares
If there is a hell, I'll see you there

He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine
His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering, and pain
Demands devotion, atrocities done in his name

God is dead, and no one cares
If there is a hell, I'll see you there
Your god is dead, and no one cares
If there is a hell, I'll see you there

Burning with your god in humility
Will you die for this?

Will you die for this?
Will you die for this?

God is dead, and no one cares
If there is a hell, I'll see you there
(Your god is dead) God is dead
(And no one cares) And no one cares

If there is a hell, I'll see you there

It's a part of me, it's inside of me
I'm stuck in this dream
It's changing me, I am becoming

The me that you know, he had some second thoughts
He's covered with scabs, he is broken and sore
The me that you know, he doesn't come around much
That part of me isn't here anymore

All pain disappears
It's the nature of, of my circuitry
Drowns out all I hear
No escape from this, my new consciousness

The me that you know, he used to have feelings
But the blood has stopped pumping and he is left to decay
The me that you know is now made up of wires
And even when I'm right with you, I'm so far away

I can try to get away, but I've strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
I can see it killing away all of my bad parts
I don't want to listen, but it's all too clear

Hiding backwards inside of me
I feel so unafraid
Annie, hold a little tighter
I might just slip away

It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead

It won't give up, it wants me dead

It won't give up, it wants me dead

Well, you know how this world can beat you down
And I'm made of clay
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way

I'm always falling down the same hill, bamboo puncturing this skin
And nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm drowning in
Two feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face
And if I could just reach you, maybe I could leave this place

Don't you tell me how I feel
You don't know just how I feel

I stay inside my bed
I have lived so many lives all in my head
And don't tell me that you care
There really isn't anything, now, is there?

You would know, wouldn't you?
You extend your hand to those who suffer
To those who know what it really feels like
To those who've had a taste, like that means something
And oh, so sick I am
And maybe I don't have a choice
And maybe that is all I have
And maybe this is a cry for help

I do not want this

Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
'Cause you do what you're told
But inside your heart, it is black and it's hollow and it's cold

Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?

What if this whole crusade's a charade
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
For the blood which we dine
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine

Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?

So naïve
I keep holding on to what I wanna believe

But I keep holding on and on and on and on

Holding on to when
When everything seemed to matter more
The two of us (All used)
All used and beaten up
Watching fate as it flows
Down the path we have chose

You and me
We're in this together now
None of them can stop us now
We will make it through somehow
You and me
If the world should break in two
Until the very end of me
Until the very end of you

Awake to the sound as they peel apart the skin
They pick and they pull, trying to get their fingers in
Well, they've got to kill what we found
Well, they've got to hate what they fear
Well, they've got to make it go away
Well, they've got to make it disappear
The farther I fall I'm beside you
As lost as I get I will find you
The deeper the wound I'm inside you
For ever and ever I am a part of

You and me
We're in this together now
None of them can stop us now
We will make it through somehow
You and me
If the world should break in two
Until the very end of me
Until the very end of you

We're in this together now
None of them can stop us now
We will make it through somehow
You and me
Even after everything
You're the queen and I'm the king
Nothing else means anything

And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away

You always were the one to show me how
Back then, I couldn't do the things that I can do now
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color if I had a heart
Come on and tell me

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look, you're all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away

I just want something I can never have

Got me a big ol' dick and I

Held against your forehead

Just for the fuck of it
Well, I can reduce you if I want
Well, I can devour
I'm hard as fucking steel
I've got the power
I'm every inch a man
And I'll show you somehow
Me and my fucking gun
Nothing can stop me now

(Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot)
I'm gonna come all over you

Tried so hard to be like you
Flew too high and burnt the wing
Lost my faith in everything
Lick around divine debris
Taste the wealth of hate in me
Shedding skin, succumb defeat
This machine is obsolete
Made the choice to go away
Drink the fountain of decay
Tear a hole, exquisite red
Fuck the rest and stab it dead
Broken, bruised, forgotten, sore
Too fucked up to care anymore
Poisoned to my rotten core
Too fucked up to care anymore
Broken, bruised, forgotten, sore
Too fucked up to care anymore
Poisoned to my rotten core
Too fucked up to care anymore
In the back, off the side, and far away
Is a place where I hide, where I stay
Tried to say, tried to ask, I needed to
All alone by myself, where were you?
How could I ever think, it's funny how
Everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now
Just like you would always say, we'll make it through
Then my head fell apart and where were you?
How could I ever think, it's funny how
Everything you swore would never change is different now
Like you said, you and me make it through
Didn't quite, fell apart, where the fuck were you?

'Cause I repeat the same routine

Then again, that might have been a dream
I think I used to have a voice
Now I never make a sound
I just do what I've been told
I really don't want them to come around, oh no

Every day is exactly the same
Every day is exactly the same
There is no love here and there is no pain
Every day is exactly the same

I can feel their eyes are watching
In case I lose myself again
Sometimes I think I'm happy here (Sometimes)
Sometimes, yet I still pretend
I can't remember how this got started
Oh, but I can tell you exactly how it will end

Every day is exactly the same
Every day is exactly the same
There is no love here and there is no pain
Every day is exactly the same

I'm writing on a little piece of paper
I'm hoping someday you might find
Well I'll hide it behind something
They won't look behind
I am still inside here, oh
A little bit comes bleeding through
I wish this could've been any other way, oh
But I just don't know, I don't know what else I can do

Every day is exactly the same
Every day is exactly the same
There is no love here and there is no pain (Every day)
Every day is exactly the same (Exactly the same, every day)
Every day is exactly the same (Every day)
Every day is exactly the same (There is no pain)
There is no love here and there is no pain (Every day)

She shines in a world full of ugliness
She matters when everything is meaningless
Fragile, she doesn't see her beauty
She tries to get away
Sometimes it's just that nothing seems worth saving
I can't watch her slip away

I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart

She reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by
Hoping someone can see
If I could fix myself I'd—
But it's too late for me

I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart

We'll find the perfect place to go where we can run and hide
I'll build a wall and we can keep them on the other side
But they keep waiting...and picking...
...and picking...and picking...
...and picking...and picking...
...and picking...and picking...
...and picking...and picking...

It's something I have to do
(I won't let you fall apart)
I was there, too
(I won't let you fall apart)
Before everything else
(I won't let you fall apart)
I was like you
(I won't let you fall apart)

I'm becoming less defined as days go by
Fading away and well, you might say I'm losing focus
Kinda drifting into the abstract
In terms of how I see myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
(I think sometimes I can see right through myself)

Less concerned about fitting into the world
Your world, that is
'Cause it doesn't really matter anymore
(No, it doesn't really matter anymore)
No, it doesn't really matter anymore
None of this really matters anymore

Yes, I am alone, but, then again, I always was
As far back as I can tell, I think maybe it's because
Because you were never really real to begin with
I just made you up to hurt myself
I just made you up to hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up to hurt myself
I just made you up to hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up to hurt myself
And it worked, yes it did

There is no you, there is only me
There is no you, there is only me
There is no fuckin' you, there is only me!
There is no fuckin' you, there is only me!

Only, only
Only, only

Well, the tiniest little dot caught my eye and it turned out to be a scab
And I had this funny feeling like I just knew it's something bad
I just couldn't leave it alone, I kept pickin' at the scab
It was a doorway tryin' to seal itself shut
But I climbed through

Now I am somewhere I am not supposed to be
And I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
And now I know why, now, n-now I know why
Things aren't as pretty on the inside

There is no you, there is only me
There is no you, there is only me
There is no fuckin' you, there is only me!
There is no fuckin' you, there is only me!

We awake in a place
We can barely recognize
Yeah, hypnosis

And you can justify it all
Your back was up against the wall again

Shut up, silence
Add a little violence
And offend and pretend and defend and demand my compliance

And you can always justify
The missile trails across the sky again

So, what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
Go and look what you gone done
Come on welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?

Needful
Too many fucking people
You'll have to take care of yourselves
You know I've got my hands full

And you can always justify
The missile trails across the sky again

Oh, what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
Hey, look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong inside?
Are you less than?


So, what are you waiting for?

Doesn't it make you feel better?

See the animal in his cage that you built
Are you sure what side you're on?
Better not look him too closely in the eye
Are you sure what side of the glass you are on?
See the safety of the life you have built
Everything where it belongs
Feel the hollowness inside of your heart
And it's all... right where it belongs

What if everything around you
Isn't quite as it seems?
What if all the world you think you know
Is an elaborate dream?
And if you look at your reflection
Is it all you want it to be?
What if you could look right through the cracks?
Would you find yourself, find yourself afraid to see?

What if all the world's inside of your head
Just creations of your own?
Your devils and your gods, all the living and the dead
And you're really all alone?
You can live in this illusion
You can choose to believe
You keep looking but you can't find the woods
While you're hiding in the trees

What if everything around you
Isn't quite as it seems?
What if all the world you used to know
Is an elaborate dream?
And if you look at your reflection
Is that all you want it to be?
What if you could look right through the cracks?
Would you find yourself, find yourself afraid to see?

(Now I'm down in it)
(Now I'm down in it)

Kinda like a cloud, I was up, way up in the sky
And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe
Sometimes I don't believe them myself
And I decided I was never coming down
Just then, a tiny little dot
Caught my eye, it was just about too small to see
But I watched it way too long
It was pulling me down

I was up above it (Oh! O-o)
I was up above it (Oh! O-o) Now I'm down in it
I was up above it (Oh! O-o)
I was up above it (Oh! O-o)
Now I'm down in it

Shut up! So what? What does it matter now?
I was swimmin' in the haze, now I crawl on the ground
And everything I never liked about you
Is kind of seeping into me
Try to laugh about it now
But isn't it funny how everything works out?
"I guess the joke's on me," she said

I was up above it (Oh! O-o)
I was up above it (Oh! O-o) Now I'm down in it
I was up above it (Oh! O-o)
I was up above it (Oh! O-o) (Now I'm down in it)

I used to be so big and strong
I used to know my right from wrong
I used to never be afraid
I used to be somebody!
I used to have something inside
Now just this hole that's open wide
I used to want it all
I used to be somebody

I'll cross my heart, I'll hope to die
But the needle's already in my eye
And all the world's weight is on my back
And I don't even know why
And what I used to think was me
Is just a fading memory
I looked him right in the eye
And said goodbye

I was up above it (Oh! O-o)
I was up above it (Oh! O-o) Now I'm down in it (Now I'm down in it)
I was up above it (Oh! O-o)
I was up above it (Oh! O-o) (Now I'm down in it)

Come again some other day
Rain, rain, go away
Come again some other day
Rain, rain, go away
Come again some other day

Come again some other day

If she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her

I am justified
I am purified
I am sanctified
Inside you

Heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel
As she walks me through the nicest parts of hell (Parts of hell)
I still dream of lips I never should have kissed
Well, she knows exactly what I can't resist

And if she says, "Come inside," I'll come inside for her
And if she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her

I am justified

(Dear mom and dad
This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write
I'd hoped somehow to get out of this quickly so that you'd never have to know about it
But that just isn't possible now
I don't know what's gonna happen, but what can I say to you?
Will "I'm sorry" make a difference? Will it ease the pain?
The shame you must be feeling, forgive me, please)

I'm just caught up in another of her spells
Well, she's turning me into someone else
Every day I hope and pray that this will end
But when I can, I do it all again

And if she says, "Come inside," I'll come inside for her
And if she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her

I am justified

Inside you

Covered in hope and Vaseline
Still cannot fix this broken machine
Watching the hole, it used to be mine
Just watching it burn in my steady systematic decline
Of the trust I will betray
Give it to me, I throw it away
After everything I've done, I hate myself for what I've become

Didn't let anyone get in
Left with a trace of all that was
And all that could have been

Please
Take this
And run far away
Far away from me

Were never meant to be
All these pieces (Pieces)
And promises
And left-behinds
If only I could see
In my nothing

Gone, fading
Everything
And all that
Could have been
Ah, could have been

Please
Take this
And run far away (Far away)
Far as you can see
I am tainted (Tainted)

And peace of mind
Were never meant for me

And right now I'm so in love with you
And I don't wanna think too much about what we
Should or shouldn't do
Lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car

Nothing quite like the feel of something new

Maybe I'm all messed up, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you, maybe I'm all messed up

This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive, ah, ah, ah

I swear
I just found everything I need
The sweat in your eyes, the blood in your veins
Are listening to me

Well, I wanna rip it up and swim in it until I drown
My moral standing is lying down

Nothing quite like the feel of something new
Maybe I'm all messed up, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you, maybe I'm all messed up

You give me the reason
You give me control
I gave you my purity
My purity you stole

Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise?
Am I just too stupid to realize?
Stale incense, old sweat
And lies, lies, lies

It comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain, it gets under my skin
Within, take in
The extent of my sin

You give me the anger
You give me the nerve
Carry out my sentence
While I get what I deserve

I'm just an effigy to be disgraced, to be defaced
Your need for me has been replaced
And if I can't have everything
Well, then, just give me a taste

It comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain, it gets under my skin
Within, take in
The extent of my sin

You give me the reason
You give me control
I gave you my purity
And my purity you stole

Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise?
Am I just too stupid to realize?
Stale incense, old sweat
And lies, lies, lies

It comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain, it gets under my skin
Within, take in
Well, my sin, it comes down to this
Your kiss, your fist
And your strain, it gets under my skin
Within, take in
The extent of my sin

Gave up trying to figure it out, but my head got lost along the way
Worn out from giving it up, but my soul I pissed it all away
Still stings these shattered nerves
Pigs we get what pigs deserve
I'm going all the way down, I'm leaving today

Come, come, come on you've gotta fill me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you
Come, come, come on you've gotta fix me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you

Still feel it all slipping away but it doesn't matter anymore
Everybody's still chipping away but it doesn't matter anymore
Look through these blackened eyes
You'll see ten thousand lies
My lips may promise but my heart is a whore

Come, come, come on you've gotta fix me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you
Come, come, come on you've gotta fill me up
Come, come, gotta let me get through to you

This isn't meant to last, this is for right now
This isn't meant to last, this is for right now
This isn't meant to last, this is for right now
This isn't meant to last, this is for right

I know it's all getting away, and it comes to me as no surprise
I know what's coming to me is never going to arrive
Fresh blood through tired skin
New sweat to drown me in
Dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive

Come, come, come on you've gotta fill me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you
Come, come, come on you've gotta fix me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you

This isn't meant to last, this is for right now
This isn't meant to last, this is for right now

This isn't meant to last, this is for right now
This isn't meant to last, this is for right now

I got my head, but my head is unraveling
Can't keep control, can't keep track of where it's traveling
I got my heart, but my heart's no good
And you're the only one that's understood
I come along, but I don't know where you're taking me
I shouldn't go, but you're wrenching, dragging, shaking me
Turn off the sun, pull the stars from the sky
The more I give to you, the more I die

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you

You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug

You make me hard when I'm all soft inside
I see the truth when I'm all stupid-eyed
Your arrow goes straight through my heart
Without you everything just falls apart

My blood wants to say hello to you
My fears want to get inside of you
My soul is so afraid to realize
(How very little there is left of me)

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you

You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug

You are the perfect drug

Now you know
This is what it feels like
Now you know

The clouds will part
And the sky cracks open
And God himself will reach
His fucking arm through
Just to push you down, just to hold you down, down
Stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss
And it's hard to believe it could come down to this
Back at the beginning (-ginning)
Sinking, spinning
And in the end
We still pretend
The time we spend
Not knowing when
You're finally free
And you could be

But it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
It didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it

Now you know
This is what it feels like
Now you know
This is what it feels like

I’ve slipped out of time again
Leaving all of you behind
And I’m free
To return to the place where I already am
And have always been
If I just really looked and allowed myself
To see
The confusion is seducing me warm perfect flowing
Wide his eyes
Summer
Hypnotize they see inside of me
Hot swollen skin want me take me perfect embrace
Black and bloody
Rotten and perfect
The center has moved on and all that’s left is free
Finally
Finally
Everyone seems to be asleep but me

Take me
Into the arms of the lovers
Free
Take me
Into the arms of the lovers

Oh I see you floating there
How could I ever hope to forget
Always rearranging, this is
Those words are a lie a mirror reflecting in a mirror of a lie
A light shines still always
Shadows in every word
Beneath black eaves
Please don’t leave me here
I could stop it
Maybe I could stop it (if I wanted to)
But I’m not the one driving anymore
I know who I am
But I know who I am
Right?

Take me
Into the arms of the lovers
Free me
Into the arms of the lovers
Into the arms of the lovers
Please

Will she come?
Is there hope for me
After all is said and done?
Anything at any price
All of this for you
All the spoils of a wasted life

Tired faith, all worn and thin
For all we could have done
And all that could have been
Ocean pulls me close
And whispers in my ear
The destiny I've chose
All becoming clear
The currents have their say
The time is drawing near
Washes me away
Makes me disappear
And I descend from grace
In arms of undertow
I will take my place
In the great below

I can still feel you
Even so far away
I can still feel you
Even so far away
I can still feel you
Even so far away
I can still feel you
Even so far away
Even so far away
Even so far away
Even so far away
So far away...

The devils of truth steal the souls of the free
Don't open your eyes, take it from me

Have some personal accountability
The biggest problem with the way that we've been doing things is

Well, I used to stand for something
Now I'm on my hands and knees
Traded in my God for this one
And he signs his name with a capital G

Don't give a shit about the temperature in Guatemala
Don't really see what all the fuss is about
Ain't gonna worry 'bout no future generations and uh
I'm sure somebody gonna figure it out
Don't try to tell me how some power can corrupt a person
You haven't had enough to know what it's like
You're only angry 'cause you wish you were in my position
Now nod your head because you know that I'm right, alright

Workin' my hands until they bleed
If I was twice the man I could be
I'd still be half of what you need
Still you lead me and I follow
Anything you ask, you know I'll do
This one act of consecration
Is what I ask of you

(Ringfinger) Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
(Ringfinger) Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me

Well, you just leave me nailed here
Hanging like Jesus on this cross
I'm just dying for your sins
And aiding to the cause

(Ringfinger) Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
(Ringfinger) Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me

Wrap my eyes in bandages
Confessions I see through
I get everything I want
When I get part of you

(Ringfinger) Promise carved in stone
Is deeper than the sea
(Ringfinger) Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me!
(Ringfinger) A promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
(Ringfinger) Devil's flesh and bone
Do something for me

(Ringfinger)
Aaaaah, c'mon, c'mon!

And the squeaking of the bed is right in time with the song that's repeating in my head
I just want you to know

When you crawl on your hands and your knees
With your face in the trough
Wait your turn, while they finish you off
Don't know when it started, don't know how
Should have found out, should have happened by now
Got these lines on my face
After all this time and I still haven't found my place

I jump from every rooftop
So high, so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all

I wake up, on the floor
Start it up again, like it matters anymore
I don't know if it does
Is this really all that there ever was?
Put the gun in my mouth
Close your eyes, blow my fucking brains out
Pretty patterns on the floor
That's enough for you, but I still need more, more, more

I jump from every rooftop
So high, so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all
I jump from every rooftop (Is this really all)
So high, so far to fall
I feel a million miles away

I should have listened to her, so hard to keep control
We kept on eating but our bloated belly's still not full
She gave us all she had but we went and took some more
Can't seem to shut her legs, our mother Nature is a whore

I got my propaganda, I got revisionism
I got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism
All a part of this great nation
I got my fist, I got my plan, I got survivalism

Hypnotic sound of sirens echoing through the street
The cocking of the rifles, the marching of the feet
You see your world on fire, don't try to act surprised
We did just what you told us, lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies

I got my propaganda, I got revisionism
I got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism
All a part of this great nation
I got my fist, I got my plan, I got survivalism

All bruised and broken, bleeding, she asked to take my hand
I turned, just keep on walking
What, you'd do the same thing in the circumstance, I'm sure you'll understand

I got my propaganda, I got revisionism
I got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism
All a part of this great nation
I got my fist, I got my plan, I got survivalism

You got your pacifism - I got survivalism
You got your pacifism - I got survivalism
You got your pacifism - I got survivalism
You got your pacifism - I got survivalism
You got your pacifism - I got survivalism
You got your pacifism - I got survivalism
You got your pacifism - I got survivalism
You got your pacifism - I got survivalism
You got your pacifism - I got survivalism
You got your pacifism - I got survivalism
You got your pacifism - I got survivalism

I woke up today
To find myself in the other place
With a trail of my footprints
From where I ran away
Seems everything I've heard just might be true
And you know me, well you think you do
Sometimes, I have everything
Yet I wish I felt something

Do you know how far this has gone?
Just how damaged have I become?
When I think I can overcome
It runs even deeper

And in a dream I'm a different me
With a perfect you, we fit perfectly
And for once in my life, I feel complete
And I still want to ruin it

Afraid to look, as clear as day
This plan has long been underway
I hear them call, I cannot stay
The voice inviting me away

Do you know how far this has gone?
Just how damaged have I become?
When I think I can overcome
It runs even deeper
Everything that matters is gone
All the hands of hope have withdrawn
Could you try to help me hang on?
It runs…

I'm straight
I won't crack
On my way
And I can't turn back
I'm okay
I'm on track
On my way
And I can't turn back
I stayed
On this track
Gone too far
And I can't come back
I stayed
On this track
Lost my way
Can't come back
I stayed
On this track
Gone too far
And I can't come back
I stayed
On this track
Lost my way
And I can't come back
I stayed
On this track
Gone too far
And I can't come back
I stayed
On this track
Lost my way
Can't come back

Sunspots cast a glare in my eyes
Sometimes I forget I'm alive
I feel it coming and I've got to get out of its way
I hear it calling and I come cause I can't disobey
I should not listen and I shouldn't believe, but I do
Yes I do

She turns me on
She makes it real
I have to apologize
For the way I feel

My life, it seems has taken a turn
Why in the name of god would I ever want to return?
Peel off our skin, we're gonna burn what we were to the ground
Fuck in the fire and we'll spread all the ashes around
I want to kill away the rest of what's left and I do
Yes I do

She turns me on
She makes it real
I have to apologize
For the way I feel

And nothing can stop me now
There is nothing to fear
And everything I'd ever want
Is inside of here
Oh, inside of here

Now I just stare into the sun
And I see everything I've done
I think I could have been someone
But I can't stop what has begun
When everything is said and done
And there is no place left to run
I think I used to be someone
Now I just stare into the sun

I've heard all I need to know
Your voice in fucking echo stereo
Well this particular scenario
Looks like another all time low
Why did you go and let them in
See this is where the fun begins
You barely even pierced the skin
Just wait 'til you see what is coming

Get down on the floor
Shut the goddamn door
Been down this road before
We’re coming back for more

So give me just a little, baby
Just something to get by
This is gonna last forever, baby
We’ll get the other side
And we will live forever, baby
And stretch across the sky
I'll follow right behind you, baby
We are never gonna die

Hey
Everything is not okay
We lost too much along the way
The passengers arrived today
It looks as though they're here to stay
This paranoia turns to fear
Just who was whispering in your ear?
Pretending, but I know you hear
Just how’d we fucking end up here?

So give me just a little, baby
(So give me just a little, baby)
Just something to get by
(Just something to get by)
This is gonna last forever, baby
(This is gonna last forever, baby)
We’ll get the other side
And we will live forever, baby
(And we will live forever, baby!)
And stretch across the sky
(And stretch across the sky)
I'll follow right behind you, baby
(I'll follow right behind you, baby!)
We are never gonna die

We're never gonna die
How did we get so high?

Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky

We are a treacherous people
As night falls down again
In this house of dust
The shades are drawn in
All of the thousands of rooms
We sleep hypnotized from the center
Yes in this new place we call home
Is there anybody but you sitting in the dark
Wondering if you'll remove my skin
Not so different after all
Remove the pain or push it back in
Maybe not so different after all
That kind of thing just doesn’t happen here
I didn’t think that could happen around here
I didn’t think that could happen to me
Can you see what is happening
Pull it out, and push it back see
I’m not from this world not anymore
Not me and I’ve come to believe that’s OK
I know who I am yes
I believe I am sleeping after all

Oh, I want to twist and twist and shout
I want you hard in my arms
So soft on my bed
You get the key to my heart
Oh, when you wear that sweet dress

But you're too physical, physical to me
You're just too physical, physical no to me

I want your roughhouse, baby
I want this right in your ear
You let me feel your danger
I let you make this feeling clear
I want the touch of your charms
The heat of your breath
I wanna say all those things
That would be better unsaid, no

But you're too physical, physical to me
You're just too physical, oh
You're too physical for me
You're too physical to me
You're really just just too just
Too really fuck no

With little bits of sticks and hair
And anything I found along the way
And tell yourself, you know?
You're not really what you know you are

I think I may have even listened to you
At the height of my demise

And I am stronger than I have ever been in my decline
I am stronger than I have ever been in my decline
For now I know, now I know, now I know for certain
Now I know for certain
Oh, burn motherfucker!
Carry the carcass and throw it on
Pull up a chair and watch
The flies come roaring out
And will surround the entire world
And blacken out the sky and every last one of you
Like a plague of locusts
Like an exit
Like an end

I can't remember much of anything anymore

A little mouth opened up inside
Yeah, I was watching on the day she died
We keep licking while the skin turns black
Cut along the length, but you can't get the feeling back

She's gone, she's gone, she's gone away
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone away

How can you turn me into this?
After you just taught me how to kiss you?
I told you I'd never say goodbye
Now I'm slipping on the tears you've made me cry

But that's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get

Why does it come as a surprise?
To think that I was so naïve
Maybe didn't mean that much
But it meant everything to me

The big come down, isn't that what you wanted?

Find a place with the failed and forgotten

Isn't that really what you wanted, now?

There is no place I can go, there is no way I can hide
It feels like it keeps coming from the inside

There is a hate that burns within
The most desperate place I have ever been

And I know it's not the right thing

Something inside of me
Has opened up its eyes
Why did you put it there?
Did you not realize?
This thing inside of me
It screams the loudest sound
Sometimes I think I could
Burn

I look down from where you're standing
Flock of sheep out on display
With all your lies propped up around you
I can take it all away

Has opened up its eyes
Why did you put it there?

I never wanted to be like you
But for all I aspire, I am really a liar

But come on, there has got to be someone

And keep it inside and fill it with lies
Open my eyes, maybe I wish I could try

The temple walls are made of flesh
Runs up my arms 'til I'm on track
Itches my skin right off my back
I'll heal your wounds
I'll set you free
I'm Jesus Christ on ecstasy

For you to go and take this
And smash it apart
I've gone all this fuckin' way
To wind up back at, back at the start

Hey, the closer we think we are
Well, it only got us so far
Now you got anything left to show?
No, no, I didn't think so
Hey, the sooner we realize
We cover ourselves with lies
But underneath we're not so tough
And love is not enough

Well, it hides in the dark
Like the witherin' vein
We didn't give it a mouth
So it cannot complain
It never really had a chance
We never really make it through
I never think I'd believe
I believed I could get better with you

Hey, the closer we think we are
Well, it never got us so far
Now you got anything left to show?

I've got to let go
I've got to get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard?
Let me get away

An effigy so wondrous to behold
A statement so profound
A place to bury everything I did
And burn it to the ground
The fire illuminates the final scene
The past repeats itself
I cannot tell the difference anymore
I cannot trust myself

I've got to let go

Yeah, parts of me are slowing down, time is speeding up

You can tell all your friends you're just a tourist, but you can't understand what they have planned until you try to leave

Cold and black and infinite, with nothing left to lose
If you try to keep the flies away, the makeup hides the bruise
Her branches are the bones that break, become a perfect line
And no he won't just be a man who's sometimes, he won't just be a man who's sometimes

I pick things up, I am a collector
And things, well things, they tend to accumulate
I have this net, it drags behind me
It picks up feelings for me to feed upon
There are times, plenty of times I wish I could let it go
But they start to breathe, and they start to grow inside me
There are times, plenty of times I wish I could let it go
But they start to make me think things I don't wanna know

I'm tryin' to fit it all inside
I'm tryin' to open my mouth wide
I'm tryin' not to choke and swallow it all, swallow it all
Swallow it all, swallow it all

I am the plague, I am the swarm
All your hurt sticks on me, and I keep it warm
They will make me stay, they won't let me leave
There are so goddamn many of them, it gets hard to breathe

I'm tryin' to fit it all inside
I'm tryin' to open my mouth wide
I'm tryin' not to choke inside
I am a good boy and I will swallow it all, swallow it all
Swallow it all, swallow it all

Every last one, every last one, every last one, every last one

This is the beginning
Watch what you think, they can read your mind
This is the beginning
I got my mark, see it in my eyes
This is the beginning

This is the beginning

We think we climb so high
Up all the backs we've condemned
We face our consequence
This is the beginning of the end

You wait your turn, you'll be last in line
This is the beginning
Get out the way, 'cause I'm getting mine
This is the beginning
God helps the ones that can help themselves
This is the beginning
May be too late as far as I can tell

We think we've come so far
On all our lies we depend
Facing our consequence
This is the beginning of the end

Smiling in their faces
While filling up the hole
So many dirty little places
In your filthy little, worn out, broken down, see-through soul

Baby's got a problem
Tries so hard to hide
Got to keep it on the surface
Because everything else is dead on the other side
Teeth in the necks of everyone you know
You can keep on sucking 'til the blood won't flow
When it starts to hurt, it only helps it grow
Taking all you need (But not this time) No, you don't

And just for the record
Just so you know
I did not believe
That you could sink so low
You think that you can beat them
I know that you won't
You think you have everything
But no, you don't

Maybe that was somebody else
Maybe I was somebody else
I'm sorry, for what it's worth, if that means anything anymore
I think there's something just wrong with me
I have been wondering, when, when did you know?
You know, really know?
No no no, I don't think that's going to happen here
You missed all that on the way out
Remember, I don't want to remember anymore
Maybe I was somebody else?
Just go back to the idea of me
Just go back to the idea of me
Just go back to the idea of me
Just—

(Wait!) None of this is happening
(Wake!) None of this is happening
(Breathe!) None of this is happening
(Believe!) None of this is happening
Hey, you tell yourself!

Oh and
If I start to tell you anything, please don't pay attention
That's not really me in there, I would never do that
Just go back to the idea of me
Go back to that idea
Can you even hear me over here?
Can't you feel it happening?
Everything absorbing liquid
Twitching, forming something terrible
The sores are gone
And you can hardly tell now but
There was someone else who isn't here anymore

(Wait!) None of this is happening
(Wake!) None of this is happening
(Breathe!) None of this is happening
(Believe!) None of this is happening
Hey, you tell yourself!
(Wait!) None of this is happening

Hey, you tell yourself!

That point me to another day
A duel of personalities
That stretch all true realities

And mocking voices ring of blood
Imperialistic house of prayer
Conquistadors who took their share

They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me

Yes, everyone seems to be asleep

Hey look, you didn't even notice
Couldn't even tell
Just when it started... happening
Maybe just as well
After all, everything is getting unfamiliar now
Trajectory in decline
And we become obsolete
A frame at a time

I'm locked inside here
Have to stay
With people who aren't here
All the way
Pictures and faces
On display
With people who aren't here
All the way (all the way)
All the way (all the way)
All the way (all the way)

It is coming, and you didn't even notice, yeah you didn't even notice... (you were missing)

I am leaving because I can't recognize who I have been
You go on spoiling
It's happening
Without me you didn't even notice
Of course it's been happening all along
Permanent intervals
As you become obsolete
Who are you?
Oh, this place...
I can't concentrate
But I know I can't trust myself

Dear world, I can hardly recognize you anymore
And yet I remain certain there is an answer in you
I feel like I have lived so long
Sometimes run out of things to try to do
I can't concentrate
What about…
I begin to go through another that we have been
I have been entirely patient
No, no, not this time

I'm locked inside here
Have to stay
With people who aren't here
All the way
Pictures and faces
On display
With people who aren't here
All the way (all the way)
All the way (all the way)
All the way (all the way)

Yes, everyone seems to be asleep

They're starting to open up the sky
They're starting to reach down through
And it feels like we're living in that split-second of a car crash
And time is slowing down
And if we only had a little more time
And this time is all there is
Do you remember the time we...?
And all the times we...?
And should have...?
And were going to...?
I know
And I know you remember
How we could justify it all
And we knew better
In our hearts we knew better
And we told ourselves it didn't matter
And we chose to continue
And none of that matters anymore
In the hour of our twilight
And soon it will be all said and done
And we will all be back together, as one
If we will continue at all

Shame on us, doomed from the start
May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us for all we have done
And all we ever were, just zeroes and ones

And you never get away
And you never get to take the easy way
And all of this is a consequence
Brought on by our own hand
If you believe in that sort of thing
And did you ever really find
When you closed your eyes
Any place that was still
And at peace?
And I guess I just wanted to tell you
As the light starts to fade
That you are the reason
That I am not afraid
And I guess I just wanted to mention
As the heavens will fall
We will be together soon, if we
Will be anything at all

Shame on us, doomed from the start
May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us for all we have done
And all we ever were, just zeroes and ones
Shame on us (shame on us), doomed from the start
May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us for all we have done (shame on us)
And all we ever were just, (just) zeroes and ones

As black as the night can get
Everything is safer now
There's always a way to forget
Once you learn to find a way how
In the blur of serenity
Where did everything get lost?
The flowers of naivete
Buried in a layer of frost

The smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes

Thought he had it all before they called his bluff
Found out that his skin just wasn't thick enough
Wanted to go back to how it was before
Thought he lost everything, then he lost a whole lot more
A fool's devotion
Swallowed up in empty space
The tears of regret
Frozen to the side of his face

The smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes

I've done all I can do
Could I please come with you?
Sweet smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes

See, I keep lying to myself
Don't know what else there is to do

Well, I think I would for you

Didn't it seem like something more?
So long, I can't remember when
All this has happened all before
And this will happen all again

Well I thought I got you on my side
I haven't got fucking anything

I'm just a face in the crowd
Nothing to worry about
Not even tryin' to stand out
I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller
And I have nothing to say
It's all been taken away
I just behave and obey
I'm afraid I am starting to fade away

Uh-huh
I kinda see through the cracks
When I press up on the wall
I'm not lookin' to stand up real high
I'd be happy to crawl
I think I'm losing my grip
But I can still make a fist
You know I still got my one good arm
That I can beat, mmm, I can beat myself up with

Nothing to worry about
Not even tryin' to stand out

And I have nothing to say
It's all been taken away
I just behave and obey

I really used to believe
That maybe there's some great thing
That we could achieve
And now I can't tell the difference
Or know what to feel
Between what I've been tryin' so hard to see
And what appears to be real


Fading away
Fading away
Fading away
Fading away

Hey, hey hey, hey, and that's okay

I don't know what I'm waiting for
I've always been 10 years ahead of you
Over and over again

I think this keeps happening
Time is running out
Over and over again
I don't know what I'm waiting for

There are things that I said I would never do
There are fears that I cannot believe have come true
For my soul is too sick and too little and too late
And myself, I have grown too weary to hate

The more I stay in here, the more it's not so clear
The more I stay in here, the more I disappear
As far as I have gone, I knew what side I'm on
But now I'm not so sure, the line begins to blur

Is there somebody on top of me? I don't know, I don't know
Isn't anybody stoppin' me? I don't know, I don't know
Well, I'm tryin' to hold my breath, I don't know, I don't know
Just how far down can I go? I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

As I lie here and stare, the fabric starts to tear
It's far beyond repair, and I don't really care
As far as I have gone, I knew what side I'm on
But now I'm not so sure, the line begins to blur

All I do, I can still feel you
All I do, I can still feel you
All I do, I can still feel you
All I do, I can still feel you

All I do, I can still feel you
Numb all through, I can still feel you
Hear your call, underneath it all
Kill my brain, yet you still remain
Crucified, after all I've died
After all I've tried, you are still inside

All I do, I can still feel you
All I do, I can still feel you

I survived everything
I have tried everything
Everything, everything
And anything

All the walls begin to dissolve away
Feel your hands begin to shake, to shake, to shake, to shake, to shake
And just who you think you used to be
All begins to bend and break, and break, and break, and break

Wave goodbye, wish me well
I've become something else
Something else, something else
(Just as well, really)

But this thing that lives inside of me
Will surely rise and wake, and wake, and wake, and wake, and wake
And his seed that bleeds right through to me
And it comes to grab and take, and take, and take, and take

I am home, I believe
I am home, I am free
I am home, I can see
Always here, finally
I am home, I believe
I am home, I am free

[Song 95: God Given]
22 ContributorsGod Given LyricsA slowed-down version of the song’s drum pattern seems to be used again on “Zero-Sum”. The pattern is also very similar to that of “My Violent Heart”.
Hey man
Please don't make a sound
Take a look around
Can't you see what's right in front of you? (Ah)
Have a little taste
No more time to waste
You don't want to get left behind, because it's all coming down right now
Now, how hard is it to see?
Put your faith in me
I sure wouldn't want to be
Praying to the wrong piece of wood
You should
Get where you belong
Everything you know is wrong
Come on, sing along everybody now

(God Given)
And he gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know we're right
When his kingdom come
And thy will be done
We have just begun
We're the chosen ones

(I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you)

Wait
Step into the light
How can this be right?
I'm afraid we're going to ask you to leave
Guess you can not win
With the color of your skin
You won't be getting in to the promised land
Besides
This is just another case
You people still don't know your place
Step aside, out the way, wipe that look off your face
Cause we are the divine
Separated from the swine
Come on, sing along everybody now

(God Given)
And he gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know we're right
Still his kingdom come
And thy will be done
And we just begun
We're the chosen ones
And he gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know we're right
Still his kingdom come
And thy will be done (And the father and the holy son)
We've just begun
We're the chosen ones

13 ContributorsNot Anymore Lyrics
Surprise
I must have let it get in
Started to turn into somebody else
Yeah I found myself believing
Tick tock tick
Time
My feet are nailed to the floor
I always thought we would get there somehow
I always thought there'd be more

Well, not anymore
Well, not anymore
Well, not anymore

Mouth taped shut
Crippled and frozen with fear
That maybe happens to somebody else
No no, that doesn't happen 'round here
I won’t forget I know who I am
No matter what, I know who I am
And what I’m doing this for

Well, not anymore
Well, not anymore
(And I can’t seem to wake up)
Well, not anymore
(And I can't seem to wake up)
Well, not anymore
(And I can't seem to wake up)
Not anymore
(And I can't seem to wake up)
Well, not anymore
(And I can't seem to wake up)
Not anymore
(And I can't seem to wake up)


I can't... I can't seem to wake up
I can't... I can't seem to wake up
I can't... I can't seem to wake up
And I can't seem to wake up
Can't seem to wake up
And I can't seem to wake up
Can't seem to wake up
And I can't seem to wake up
I can't seem to wake up!
And I can't-
I can't wake up
I can't... I can't seem to wake-

What did he say? What words did you speak?
That's what I want to know
Now, tell me, now, now, all of it, now, tell me, yes!

Get down, make love

You say you're hungry, I give you meat
I suck your mind, you blow my head
Make love, inside your bed

Every time I get high you say you want to come down

Come on so heavy when you take me

None of that matters anymore

My God

I am you and you are me

Gun fire in the street
Where we used to meet
Echoes out a beat and the bass goes
Bomb right over my head
Step over the dead
Remember what you said, you know, the part about
Life is just a waking dream
Well, I know what you mean
But that ain't how it seems right here, right now
How can this be real?
I can barely feel anymore

I am trying to see
I am trying to believe
This is not where I should be
I am trying to believe

Blood hardens in the sand
Cold metal in my hand
Help you understand the way that things are gonna be
There's nowhere left to hide
'Cause God is on our side
I keep telling myself

I am trying to see
I am trying to believe
This is not where I should be
I am trying to believe
No one's even sure what we're fighting for
Or who we even are anymore
I feel so far away

Bow down in position
Against the polished steel
This is something different
You'll like the way this feels
No time for asking questions
No time for wondering
We've heard enough from you now
We've heard everything
We're gonna play a new game
You'll put on this blindfold
You'll do what we tell you
You'll do as you're told
Used to be the leader, but
Now comes the time to serve
Maybe we show some mercy
Maybe you get what you deserve

Count down to the end
Gotta make it go faster
Right around the bend
Is a coming disaster (disaster)

Count down to the end
And we're headed there faster
Come on down, my friend
It's time to meet your master

You've left quite a mess here
Under your stewardship
You thought you'd figured it out but
You'll learn your place in this
Might take some convincing
For you to see the truth
There are so many things that
We've got in store for you

Count down to the end
Gotta make it come faster (faster)
Right around the bend
Is a coming disaster
Count down to the end
And we're headed there faster (faster)
Come on down my friend
It's time to meet your master

Come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down

You know everything gets written down
Nod your head
Just in case they could be watching
With their shiny satellite

I hope they cannot see
The limitless potential
Living inside of me
To murder everything
I hope they cannot see
I am the great destroyer

Turn it up
Listen to the shit they pump into your head
Filling you with apathy
Hold your breath
Wait until you know the time is right on time
The end is near

I hope they cannot see
The limitless potential
Living inside of me
To murder everything
I hope they cannot see
I am the great destroyer

You and I, we may look the same
But we are very far apart
There's bullet holes where my compassion used to be
And there is violence in my heart
Into fire you can send us
From the fire we return
You can label us a consequence
Of how much you have to learn

You can try but you'll never understand
This is something you will never understand
Can you hear it now?
Hear it coming now?
Can you hear it now?

On hands and knees, we crawl
You cannot stop us all
Our bones, our skin
We will not let you in

You have set something in motion
Much greater than you've ever known
Standing there in all your grand naivety
About to reap what you have sown

Time will feed upon your weaknesses
And soon you'll lose the will to care
When you return to the place that you call home
We will be there
We will be there

On hands and knees, we crawl
You cannot stop us all
Our blood will stay
We will not go away
On hands and knees, we crawl
You cannot stop us all
Our blood, our grace
Will never leave this place

We crawl
We crawl
We crawl
We crawl

Watch the sun
As it crawls across a final time
And it feels like
Like it was a friend
If it's watching us
And the world we set on fire
Do you wonder
If it feels the same?

And the sky is filled with light
Can you see it?
All the black is really white
If you believe it
As your time is running out
Let me take away your doubt
You can find a better place
In this twilight

Dust to dust
Ashes in your hair remind me
What it feels like
And I won't feel again
Night descends
Could I have been a better person
If I could only
Do it all again?

But the sky is filled with light
Can you see it?
All the black is really white
If you believe it
And the longing that you feel
You know none of this is real
We will find a better place
In this twilight

I'm getting by in other ways
Everything they whispered in our ear is coming true
Try to justify the things I used to do - believe in you

Watching you drown, I'll follow you down

The lights in the sky have finally arrived
I am staying right beside you

I tried to stay away, just in case
I've come to realize, we all have our place
Time, time has a way, you know, to make it clear
And I have my role in this:
I can't disappear or leave you here

Watching you drown, I'll follow you down
And I am here right beside you
The lights in the sky are waving goodbye
And I am staying right beside you

Some say it was a sign
I was standing right there
When it came down from the sky
The way it spoke to us
You felt it from inside
Said it was up to us
Up to us to decide
"You've become a virus
That's killing off its host
We've been watching you with all of our eyes
And what you seem to value most

So much potential
Or so we used to say
Your greed, self-importance and your arrogance
You piss it all away
We heard her cry
We've come to intervene
You will change your ways and you will make amends
Or we will wipe this place clean"

Nice and high and far apart
Just like they said
I built this place with broken parts
Just like they said
You chip away the old version of you
You'd be surprised at what you can do
I'm safe in here, irrelevant
Just like they said

My voice just echoes off these walls
My voice just echoes off these walls

You feel me breathe, I am watching you
I see it all
The many ways you can't get to me
I see it all
I see the hell you put yourself through
Oh, the things I could do, if I wanted to

My voice just echoes off these walls
My voice just echoes off these walls
I don't need anything at all
My voice just echoes off these walls

And I just slowly fade away
And I just slowly fade away
And I just slowly fade away

You will never ever ever ever get to me

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way...

You, what you looking at?
Head down, too late for that
What you want - what you get
Know your place, don't ever forget

And this is not my face and this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here I can recognize
And this is all a dream and none of you are real
I'll give anything, I'll give anything

Hey you, what you running from?
All your hate, what you've become
Bet you didn't think, it would happen to you
All used up half way through

And this is not my face and this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here, I can recognize
And this is all a dream and none of you are real
And I'll give anything, you know, I'll give anything

Do you ever want to
Just get out of here?
So disappointed
You disappear

Look at you
Superman
With all the world
To save
You think by now
You’d figure out
That nothing’s going

And I am part of the reason

What did you expect?

With what you get
Do you ever want to
Just get out of here?

The sky is painted black
The smoke pours out the stack
One hand upon your heart
One hand behind your back
You train us how to act
You keep the fear intact
The imminent attack
Everything is right on track

We are letting you get away

Upon our plates to feed
The dying left to bleed
How much we really need
Your politics of greed
The cancer takes ahold
The wolf is in the fold

Everything
Is catching up with me
I awake
To find I'm not at all where I
Should be
And it feels
I'm getting to the end
And it's hard
To figure out what's real, and what's
Pretend

To break from what we're tied to
God knows how much I've tried to

And I am still inside you
And I am still inside you

I escape
Every now and then
And to think
I find myself back here again
And again
I used to know who I was
Until you came along
I return
To the only place I've ever felt
That I belong

To break from what we're tied to
God knows how much I've tried to

And I am still inside you
And I am still inside you

Blank stare, disrepair
There's a big black hole gonna eat me up someday
Someday fades away like a memory
Or a place that you'd rather be
Some place lost in space
Itch in my head, that's telling me somewhere
Somewhere out there anywhere
I don't care, get me out of here

If I could feel
All the pins and the pricks
If you were real
I could take what's apart
And put it back together

This will come true
Help me get through
Into you
Deep, deep
Deep, deep
Deep, deep
Deep, deep

All I can do
Driving me through
Into you
Deep, deep
Deep, deep
Deep, deep
Deep, deep

One track, get you on your back
Your skin speaks up
But your lips couldn't say it
Right now, you know somehow
We could take a chance
And we could make it, make it
Right here, make it all disappear
Everything we have been missing, missing

You make me feel
That there's a part of me
That I wanna get back again

Make this come true
Help me get through
Into you
Deep, deep
Deep, deep
Deep, deep
Deep, deep

All I can do
Pushing it through
Into you
Deep, deep

Driving on through

You're slipping through
I come into
Into you
Deep, deep

We could become, two into one
Leave this behind, over and done
Everything new, I'm getting through

Through each tissued corridor
Throb to the pulse of life

Let your heart pump you
Down long red tunnels
Can you let your heart pump you
Down long red tunnels
Stream into cell chambers
Can you let your heart become the central pumphouse
For all human feeling
Help! Help!
I'm drowning
Let me out of here
Drift to the center
Drift to center
I'm drowning
I need some help
Center on this heart fire of love
Let your heart beat for all life
Radiate, swell, penetrate, to the bumpy rhythm
Burst

Bleed out
Bleed out
Bleed to death
Bleed to death
Life blood

Oh you just wish I could feel that way too
I'll bet you will someday
