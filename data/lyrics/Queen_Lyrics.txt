Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all


I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah, no, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah, we will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be

De day da
Ee day da

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day de mm hm

Chipping around, kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days, it never rains, but it pours

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep coming up with love, but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

'Cause love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And love (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure

Caviar and cigarettes
Well-versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam

Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah (Killer)
Then again incidentally (Killer)
If you're that way inclined (She's a killer queen)

Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less

Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam

Drop of a hat, she's as willing as
Playful as a pussycat

To absolutely drive (Drive you wild)

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine

(Anytime) Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

Woo, I kinda like it

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat


I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride
On my motorbike until I'm ready

Full of sad things
We can do the tango, just for two
I can serenade and gently play
On your heart strings
Be a Valentino, just for you

What're you doing tonight?"
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy

Ooh, let me feel
Your heartbeat (Grow faster, faster)
Ooh, can you feel my love heat? (Ohh)
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me how do you feel, right after all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command

"Ooh love, ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy"
Write my letter, feel much better
I'll use my fancy patter on the telephone

When I'm not with you, think of you always
I miss you (I miss those long hot summer nights)
When I'm not with you, think of me always
Love you, love you
Hey boy where do you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?
I learned my passion in the good old-fashioned
School of lover boys


Dining at the Ritz, we'll meet at nine
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock) precisely
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours, that will be fine (Come on and get it)

Ooh love (There he goes again)
Ooh lover boy (Who's my good Old-fashioned lover boy?)

In the year of '39 assembled here, the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day, and the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew


In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day, and they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weight
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darling, we'll away but my love this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand
For my life still ahead, pity me

It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
I love you 'til I die
Save me, save me, save me!
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me!
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I’ll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted, all that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me, save me, save me!
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh!
I'm naked and I'm far from home


Each night, I cry
I still believe the lie
I love you 'til I die (Ow!)

I'm in love with my car
Got to feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So, she made tracks
Saying, "This is the end now
Cars don't talk back
They're just four-wheeled friends, now"

When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruising in overdrive
Don't have to listen
To no run-of-the-mill talk jive

I'm in love with my car (Ooh, I'm in love with my car)

While we rule by blind madness

We'll tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying
'Till the end of time

Just turn yourself into anything
You think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego, be free, be free
To yourself

If there's a God, or any kind
Of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason
To live or die
If there's an answer to the questions
We feel bound to ask
Show yourself, destroy our fears
Release your mask

Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey, tread that fine line
Yeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah

You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts

With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division

Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
Killjoy, bad guy
Big talking small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good? Are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide? (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good? (Feel good!)


(Ah!) Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide
Dog with disease
You're the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is
Mr. Know-All, was the fin on your back part of the deal?
Shark!

Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart (You never did)
Of your own (Right from the start)
Insane, should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Make yourself null and void
Make me feel good (I feel good!)

Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it (and the world will so allow it)
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size
(March to the Black Queen)


Put them in the cellar
With the naughty boys
A little niggah sugar
Then a rub-a dub-a baby oil

Black on, black on
Every finger nail and toe, we've only begun, begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
(Oooh, march to the Black Queen)

Ooh, now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby
You can be my honey-chile, yes



A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings, you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
(A little bit of love and joy)
Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
(A little bit of love and joy)
In each and every soul
Lies a man and very soon
He'll deceive and discover
But even 'till the end of his life
He'll bring a little love

I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power
Now do the march of the black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the black Queen
Ah, ah, ah, ah


Walking true to style
She's vulgar, 'buse, and vile
Fie-fo the black Queen, tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes and she never dots her i's
(She's our leader)


Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone
(La la la la forever) forever

What's happening, Flash?
Only Doctor Hans Zarkov, formerly at NASA, has provided any explanation

Flash, ah
He's a miracle
This morning's unprecedented solar eclipse is no cause for alarm
Flash, ah
King of the impossible

He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
(Oh) He saves with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman, every child, it's the mighty flash (Oh)

General Kala, Flash Gordon approaching
What do you mean Flash Gordon approaching? Open fire! All weapons! Dispatch war rocket Ajax to bring back his body

Flash, ah
Gordon's alive
Flash, ah
He'll save every one of us

Just a man with a man's courage
You know he's nothin' but a man
And he can never fail
No one but the pure at heart
May find the Golden Grail
Oh, oh

Flash, Flash, I love you, but we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth

[Song 33: Don’t Try Suicide]
33 ContributorsDon’t Try Suicide LyricsThe exact history of this song is unknown, but it is unlikely that it was written due to a friend of the band’s suicide, as the song takes a very lighthearted approach to a serious topic.
One, two, three, four, one!
Yeah
Okay
Don't do it
Don't you try, baby

Don't do that (Don't, don't, don't)
Don't do that (You got a good thing goin' now)
Don't do it, don't do it, don't

Don't try suicide, nobody's worth it
Don't try suicide, nobody cares
Don't try suicide, you're just gonna hate it
Don't try suicide, nobody gives a damn

So you think it's the easy way out?
Think you're gonna slash your wrists this time?
Baby, when you do it, all you do is get on my tits

Don't do that (Try, try, try, baby)
Don't do that (You got a good thing goin' now)
Don't do it, don't do it, don't

Don't try suicide, nobody's worth it
Don't try suicide, nobody cares
Don't try suicide, you're just gonna hate it
Don't try suicide, nobody gives a damn

You need help
Look at yourself, you need help (Yeah)
You need life
So don't hang yourself
It's okay, okay, okay, okay
You just can't be a prick teaser all of the time

A little bit attention? You got it
Need some affection? You got it (Hey)
Suicide, suicide, suicide bid (Oh)
Suicide, suicide, suicide bid (Uh)
Suicide (Hey)
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, babe (Yeah)
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it!

Don't put your neck on the line
Don't drown on me, babe
Blow your brains out

Don't do that (Yeah)
Don't do that (You got a good thing going, baby)
Don't do it, (No) don't do it, (No!) don't

Don't try suicide, nobody's worth it
Don't try suicide, nobody cares
Don't try suicide, you're just gonna hate it
Don't try suicide, nobody gives, nobody gives
Nobody gives a damn

Oh-oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man!

I dreamed I saw, on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves

"I see no day," I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

Oh-oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand
Oh-oh, children of the land
Quicken to the new life, take my hand
Ooh, fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove

He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved, babe
Late too late, all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own, his precious gain

The earth will shake, in two will break
And death all around will be your dowry!

Oh-oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan

Oh, oh
And two by two, my human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain
Oh, flee for your life
Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you
Oh, fear for your life
Deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you?

Ah, people can you hear me?
People can you hear me?
People can you hear me?
And now I know and now I know
And now I know, I know
I know that you can hear me
And now I know, now I know
That you can hear me
And now I know that you can hear me
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know
The earth will shake, in two will break
The earth will shake, in two will break
In two will break
In two will break
In two will break
In two will break
Death all around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around
Now I know, now I know, now I know
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

God give you grace to purge this place
And peace all around may be your fortune

Oh-oh, children of the land
Love is still the answer, take my hand
The vision fades, a voice I hear
"Listen to the madman"

Ooh, but still I fear and still I dare not
Laugh at the madman

There's no reason for living
With a broken heart
This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone

You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over
And I'm falling apart
Yeah, yeah

It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever
In each other's hearts
It's a long, hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When you're in love

I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone

How it hurts (Yeah) deep inside (Oh yeah)
When your love has cut
You down to size
Life is tough, on your own
Now I'm waiting for something
To fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love

Yes, it's a hard life
True lovers together
To love and live forever
In each other's hearts
It's a long, hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When you're in love

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Yeah!) It's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching
For love in every way
It's a long, hard fight (Hard fight!)
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself
And say I did it for love
Yes, I did it for love
For love
Oh, oh, oh I did it for love

There's a rumour going round, gotta clear out of town
Yeah, I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the law, gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, I never, I never want it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Crazy (stone cold crazy, you know)
Woo! Aw!


Rainy afternoon, I gotta blow a typhoon
And I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Crazy (stone cold crazy, aw! You know)
Oww, hit 'em up


Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
With my rubber tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me
I gotta get me get up and run
They got the sirens loose, I ran right outta juice
They're going to put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven, will they let me go to hell?

Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell
"Jenny will you stay, tarry with me, pray
Nothing e'er need come between us
Tell me, love, what do you say?"
"Oh no, I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover
How I spent my holiday"
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell

Oh, Rock of Ages
Do not crumble, love is breathing still
Oh, lady, moonshine down
A little people magic if you will


Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together
Nothing can my love erase"
Oh no, I'm compromised, I must apologize
If my lady should discover
How I spent my holidays
Ooh
Ooh, ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ha!

She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado about nothing
Is what she'd try to say
So much ado, my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day

All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone
All dead

All dead, all dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All dead and gone


Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please, you must forgive me
I am old but still a child
All dead, all dead
But I should not grieve
In time, it comes to everyone
All dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course, I don't believe
You're dead and gone

All dead and gone

Sammy was low, just watchin' the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him, "Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweepin' up the Emerald Bar"

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together 'cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keepin' his thoughts to himself
He'd be leaving soon
Wishin' he was miles and miles away
Nothin' in this world, nothin' would make him stay
Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothin' came easy to him
Now it was time, he'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him, "Now listen, boy! You're always dreamin'
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald Bar?"

So honey, spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together 'cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

Come on, honey

Ooh, don't worry, baby

Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so?
Yeah, she made me live again

A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don't I love him so?

Meanwhile, I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could, but you can't

A brand new angle, highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous

I feel so romantic, can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime? (Ooh, I'd like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season
The Mediterranean
This time of year, it's so fashionable


I feel like dancing in the rain
Can I have a volunteer?
(Just keep right on dancing)
What a damn jolly good idea
It's such a jollification, as a matter of fact
So très charmant, my dear

Underneath the moonlight
Together we'll sail across the sea
Reminiscing every night
Meantime (And in the meantime, baby)
I ask you to be my valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial, start a sensational

Seaside rendezvous, so adorable
Seaside rendezvous, ooh-ooh
Seaside rendezvous, give us a kiss

He's a fairy feller

Ah, ah, the fairy folk have gathered ‘round the new-moon shine
To see the feller crack a nut at night's noon-time
To swing his axe he swears
As he climbs he dares
To deliver (The master-stroke)

Ploughman, "Waggoner Will", and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
He's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
Dirty fellow, what a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and a junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
He's my hero (Aaaaah!)

Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
(Can we see the master-stroke)
What a quaere fellow


Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader

Oberon and Titania
Watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen
And there's a good apothecary man
Come to say hello

Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow

The ostler stares
With hands on his knees
Come on, Mr. Feller
Crack it open if you please

Ah-ah

In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever (Ooh, yeah)
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows through the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on, on, on, on
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

My fairy king (He rules the air and turns the tides)
He rules the air and can see things that are not there
For you and me to see (Ooh, yeah)
My fairy king (He guides the winds)
He can do right and nothing wrong

(Ah) Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land
(Ooh, ooh)

They turn milk into sour, like the blue in the blood of my veins
(Why can't you see it?)
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
(Son of Heaven set me free and let me go)
Sea turns dry, no salt from sand
And seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor men's eyes (No more)

Someone, someone
Has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Oh, Mother Mercury (Mercury)
Look what they've done to me (Yeah)
I cannot run, I cannot hide

So sad, her eyes
Smiling, dark eyes
So sad, her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow, the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The white Queen walks
And the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing, unheard
Pleading one word
So sad, my eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare? What have thee seen?
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White Queen, how my heart did ache
And dry my lips, no word would make
So still I wait


My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's forevermore that I wait

Dear friend, goodbye
No tears in my eyes
So sad, it ends
As it began

12 ContributorsBohemian Rhapsody (2011 Remaster) Lyrics
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

If I can't have you when I'm waking

Oh take me, take me
Take me to the dreamers' ball

And I'll dress so fine

I won't have to worry
Take me, take me
Promise not to wake me
'Til it's morning, it's all been true

What d'you say about that, hey honey?
You gonna take me
To that dreamers' ball?

Right on that 42nd street
Way down, downtown dreamers' ball

Oh take me, take me
Take me I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile
With the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely
Perceptible whisper
Gently take me
Remember I'll be dreaming
Of my baby at the dreamer's ball

Take me, hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamers' ball
I'll meet you at the dreamers' ball

Watching the time, mustn't linger behind
Pardon me, I have to get away

You couldn't lose, you couldn't fail

To let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see
Just what you do to me
Oh, jealousy, you tripped me up
Jealousy, you brought me down
You bring me sorrow, you cause me pain
Jealousy, when will you let go?
Got a hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous kind

How, how, how, oh my jealousy

As he puffed his pipe and Baby B
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company

Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her
"Won't you keep me company?"
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Oh, marry me for evermore
We'll be good company
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Now marriage is an institution, sure
My wife and I, our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door

I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts
My own limited company


I hardly noticed Sally
As we parted company

All through the years
In the end, it appears
There was never really anyone but me

Now I'm old, I puff my pipe
But no one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity

Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

Against the law?
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?

You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Oh, oh-oh

Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?
If there's a God in the sky, looking down
What can He think of what we've done
To the world that He created?

The man is evil and that is right
I told you (Ah, yes, I told you)
And that's no lie (Oh, no, no)

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?
Show me!

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know, people? (People)
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?
Hit it!

Now listen, all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what Mama says
Not a word, not a word Mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival, sure
The great Lord, before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said, "You're going to realize tomorrow"
No, I'm not gonna tell you what you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come, come on, the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before
Ooh, hear it
Dirty old man
Dirty old man


Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?

When something so near and dear to life
Explodes inside
You feel your soul is set on fire
When something so deep and so far and wide

Come back to me
Be happy like we used to be (Uuh, Uuuuh)

It's the sad-eyed goodbye
Yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street, weak-kneed
Partings I recall

It's the mistier mist, the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays

There's all the more reason
For laughing and crying
When you're younger
And life isn't too hard at all

It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings to waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years

It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero, it all turns to zero

And there's all the more reason
For living or dying
When you're young
And your troubles are all very small

Out here on the street, we'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet
And half of the time we'd broaden our minds more
In the pool hall than we did in the school hall
With the downtown chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun

Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain’t easy for a smalltown boy
It ain’t easy at all

Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for breakfast, I guess
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror
Now who else do I like?

Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on my terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past

Life is real, life is real
Life is real, so real

Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream is just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel

Life is real, life is real
Life is real, oh yeah

Success is my breathing space
I brought it on myself
I will price it
I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breastfeeding myself
What more can I say
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it

Life is real, life is real
Life is real


Music will be my mistress
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in every pore

Life is real, life is real
Life is real, so real

Life is cruel
Life is a bitch
Life is real, so real
Life is real, life is real
Yeah, life is real

Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand!


(Dreaming) A cozy fireside chat
(Dreaming) A little this, a little that
(Dreaming) Sound of merry laughter skippin' by
(Dreaming) Gentle rain beatin' on my face!
(Dreaming) What an extraordinary place!
And the dream of the child
Is the hope of the, hope of the man!

It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky
Yeah!
Mountains are zoomin' higher, uh
Little girls scream and cry
My world is spinnin', and spinnin', and spinnin'
It's unbelievable
Sends me reeling
Am I dreamin'?
Am I dreamin'?

Ooh, it's bliss

Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star
Right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you, yeah

My heart cries out to your heart
I'm lonely, but you can save me
My hand reaches out for your hand
I'm cold, but you light the fire in me
My lips search for your lips
I'm hungry for your touch
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender
To the moment your surrender


And no one ever told me
That love would hurt so much
(Ooh, yes, it hurts)
And pain is so close to pleasure
And all I can do is surrender to your love
(Just surrender to your love)

Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star

18 ContributorsWho Needs You Lyrics
I make it half past six, you come at seven
Always try to keep me hanging round
You little spoilt thing
Girl, you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view

This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well, I don't need
Who needs you?

Oh, I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding
Lying flat on your face
Reaching out reaching out
For a helping hand
(Where is that helping hand?)

Oh, muchachos
I like it, I like it
Well, I don't need you

How I was pushed around
Don't let it get you down
You walked all over me
But don't you ever give in
Taking one step forward
Slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling
That you can't forget
Reaching out for a helping hand

When I met you
You were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine
You were, oh, so, so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say

I had to swallow my pride
So naïve you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs, well, I don't need
Who needs you?

Don't break the spell darling, now you are near
Look in my eyes and speak to me

Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Love me slow and gently

One foolish world, so many souls
Senselessly hurled through the never-ending cold
And all for fear, and all for greed
Speak any tongue, but for God's sake we need

Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Let me know, this night and evermore


This room is bare, this night is cold
We're far apart and I'm growing old
But while we live, we'll meet again
So then, my love, we may whisper once more
It's you I adore

Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Touch me now, oh

Las palabras de amor
Let us share the words of love
Forevermore
Forevermore

Who knows who she'll make me
As I lie in her cocoon
But the world will surely heal my ills
I'm warm and terrified
She makes me so

I know the day I leave her
I'll love her still
She is my love
She is my love

How long I'll take
And if I'm very slow
She makes me so

She is my love

Oh-oh, the night comes down
Ooh, and it's dark again

Once I could laugh with everyone
Once I could see the good in me
The black and the white distinctively
Colouring, holding the world inside
Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see, you gotta believe it

But if you fall and take a tumble, it won't be far
If you fail, you mustn't grumble, thank your lucky stars
Just savor every mouthful and treasure every moment
When the storms are raging 'round you, stay right where you are

Oh, don't try so hard
Oh, don't take it all to heart
It's only fools, they make these rules
Don't try so hard

One day, you'll be a sergeant major, oh, you'll be so proud
Screamin' out your bloody orders, hey, but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons, dress as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try to stand out from the crowd

I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain’t nobody wants to know

I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

So 'round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I ever seen
Hey, sonny, won't you sign
Right along the dotted line?
What you sayin', are you playin'
Sure you don't mean me?

I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home
Now, I'll tell you what happened

They took me to a room without a table
They said "blow your trumpet into here"
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin'
All the people wanna listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

And I was sleepin' like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
Have to have some fun


Now they tell me
That I ain’t so fashion-able
And that I owe the man
A million bucks a year
So I told 'em
Where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here, yeah
Back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game

I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry
And I sure do wanna go home

Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long, long way behind us
Who knows when
Now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day

Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home

Hurry, put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live, I could not live this way

Did we leave our way behind us?
Such a long, long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane

(Such a long, long way

Over us and we're alone

And she looked and smiled at me

Wednesday, I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday
My luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name

I never thought that this
Could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade


I wish Friday
Would last forever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there

Saturday
Just twenty-four hours
Oh no, I'm going back
Home on Sunday

I'm so sad alone

We love you madly

Was it all worth it?
Living breathing rock 'n' roll
This Godforsaken life
Was it all worth it? (Yeah)
Was it all worth it?
When the hurly burly's done



We went to Bali
Saw God and Dali
So mystic, surrealistic

Was it all worth it? Yeah, yeah!
Giving all my heart and soul
And staying up all night
Was it all worth it?
Ooh, living breathing rock 'n' roll
This never ending fight
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it?

Yes, it was a worthwhile experience, hahahaha!
It was worth it!

And I slam the door and I'm on my way

'Cause I've made my break and I won't look back
I've turned my back on those endless games

I'm all through with ties, I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man, don't it look that way?
Shaking dust from my shoes, there's a road ahead
And there's no way back home (No way back home)
Oh, but I have to say

Leaving home ain’t easy
Oh, I never thought it would be easy
Leaving on your own
Oh, there's a million things a-calling me back
Leaving home ain’t easy
On the one you're leaving home

Stay, my love
My love, please stay
Don't stray, my love
What's wrong, my love?
What's right, my love?

Leaving home ain’t easy
My God, how could I think of leaving?
Leaving on your own
Still trying to persuade me that
Leaving home ain’t necessarily the only way

Leaving home ain’t easy
But may be the only way

And you're flat on your back
A brand new day's beginning
Get that sunny feeling

Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying c'est la vie
So this is life

There must be more to life than living
There must be more than meets the eye
What good is life, if in the end we all must die
There must be more to life than this

There must be more to life than killing
There must be more to life than this

Then we can all just live in peace

Yeah, yeah

Action

This street, honey, is a mean street
Living in this street, honey, needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street

But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me

This town, honey, is a dead town
Living in this town, honey, is a let-down
Coming to this town, honey, is a showdown

But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
Still, there's a feeling, this world is using me

Action this day
Action this night
Oh, we've gotta learn to learn to love to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day
Action this night
Oh, you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love and to live
You can't say it ain't right

Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your mind's living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race

But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this world is using me

Action this day, yeah
Action this night
Ooh, we've got to learn to learn to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day, yeah
Action this night
Oh, You've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love and to live
You can't say it ain't right

I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious
Honey

Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life
A little rain must fall

No problem, uh
Be cool, now

Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have position
To call the shots and name the price
Honey

You found success and recognition
But into every life
A little rain must fall
Flow John!


You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life
A little rain must fall

Be cool
Ha!
Kiss, kiss

Others seem to think
You are over dramatizing
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions, honey

You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cause into every life
A little rain must fall

Be cool, get this
Woo! Alright

Play it nice and cool
Play it nice and cool, yeah
Yes, baby
Ooh, one more time
Uh-huh, I like it
Make it rain

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Everybody knows
One day we're loving each other
Then we're fighting one another
All the time

When I was young
And just getting started
And people talked to me
They sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my 'magination
And all I wanted
Was to start a new relation
So in love, but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for
Some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed
Was some love and affection

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure

Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong
And you turn out the light
But inside of your mind
You put up a fight

Where are the answers
That we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world
To be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good
Some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy
Someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness of love
Wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse
So let's make the best
Of the rest of our years

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life

All your life, ooh
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure

From the sprinklers
It also left a man's decapitated body
Lying on the floor
Next to his own severed head
A head which at this time
Has no name

I'm the master of your destiny
Ha-ha

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Give me the prize
Just give me the prize

Give me your kings
Let me squeeze them in my hands

Your puny princes
Your so-called leaders of your land
I'll eat them whole before I'm done
The battle's fought and the game is won

[Song 149: Killer Queen (2011 Remaster)]
9 ContributorsKiller Queen (2011 Remaster) Lyrics
She keeps Moet et Chandon, in her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah (A killer, a killer)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined (She's a killer queen)
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less, fastidious and precise

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime


Drop of a hat, she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try? (Wanna try?)

'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord
